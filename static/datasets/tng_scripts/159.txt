ANGOSIAN CAPITOL - ESTABLISHING (MATTE)	A cluster of low buildings, a bud of civilization whose	outlying roadways vein a vast plain.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 43489.2.			We have arrived at Angosia, a			planet that is eager for			membership in the Federation.2    EXT. ANGOSIAN SENATE	PICARD and RIKER are with NAYROK, the Angosian leader,	in the rotunda of the senate building. The Angosians	take their civic duty very seriously and the senate is	considered a repository of wisdom and law. Various	government officials and petitioners pass by, either	in deep discussion or thoughtful meditation.					PICARD			I'm greatly impressed with what			I've seen so far, Prime Minister.					NAYROK			Then I hope it will reflect			favorably in your report, Captain.					RIKER			It's a tribute to your people to			have recovered so rapidly from			the Tarsian War.					NAYROK			It is indeed.				(sadly)			We are not warriors. We believe			reason can settle disputes. But			not every culture agrees with our			position.					PICARD			An unfortunate reality.      STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - REV. 10/27/89 - TEASER      2.2    CONTINUED:					NAYROK			The development of the mind, the			cultivation of the intellect --			these are the pursuits to which			the Angosians have dedicated			themselves for centuries.	Nayrok nods and is about to respond... but is	interrupted by ZAYNAR, an aide who casually interrupts.					ZAYNAR			I'm sorry to interrupt, Prime			Minister. There's a problem.			May I see you a moment?					NAYROK			Excuse me, gentlemen.3    ANGLE --	on Picard and Riker.					PICARD			I think they'll make a fine			addition to the Federation, Number			One...	Riker acknowledges, but without enthusiasm. Off	Picard's look...					RIKER			I'm not sure I'd want to live			here. A little stuffy for my			taste.	Picard thinks it over, nods slightly. It's a little	dry for his taste, too.4    ANOTHER ANGLE --	Nayrok returns, his face has a look of concern...					NAYROK			A prisoner has escaped from the			penal colony on Lunar Five.				(shaking his head)			Two guards are dead. The prisoner			has taken a transport vessel.      STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - REV. 10/27/89 - TEASER      2A.4    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Do you have means of pursuit?         STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - TEASER         3.4    CONTINUED:					NAYROK			The tracking station was			sabotaged. The entire base is			in chaos. We have ordered ships			from the surface to follow him,			but to be honest, our civilian			pilots are not trained to handle			this...					RIKER			With your permission, sir... ?	Picard acknowledges.					RIKER				(keying his insignia)			Mister Data, a stolen transport			vessel has departed from Lunar			Five. Have you picked it up on			sensors?									INTERCUT:5    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	DATA is in command. GEORDI, WORF, and WESLEY are on	the bridge. Supernumeraries.					DATA				(checking sensors)			Yes, Commander.					RIKER			Good. Detain the vessel and			quarantine the pilot.				(to Nayrok)			Is he armed?					NAYROK			Yes. And he's very dangerous,			Captain. Lunar Five is our			maximum security facility.					RIKER			Did you hear that, Data?					DATA			Yes, Commander, we will use			extreme caution.         STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - TEASER         4.5    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Keep us informed. Riker out.					WORF			On screen, sir...									END INTERCUT:6    ANGLE ON THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	A small ship, as well as an asteroid, are visible in	front of the planet.					DATA			Specifications on the vessel,			Mister Worf.					WORF			No warp drive. Minimal weaponry.					DATA			Heading, Ensign Crusher.					WESLEY			Three-one-nine mark			two-five-zero.					GEORDI			Vessel's speed increasing to			point-two impulse. He's seen us,			Data.7    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Moving toward the transport vessel... which disappears	behind the asteroid.8    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	On the main viewscreen, we see that only a small piece	of the ship appears on the other side of the asteroid.					GEORDI				(reacts)			The ship's drive section...					WESLEY			What happened to the rest of his			ship?         STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - TEASER         5.8    CONTINUED:					DATA			Scan the drive section for life			form readings.					WORF			None.					DATA			Mister Crusher, bring us around			to the back side of the asteroid.	A beat.					GEORDI			Sensors indicate wreckage on the			asteroid's surface.					WORF			No life signs.					DATA			Apparently, he did not survive.	Wesley, puzzled, is checking his console... and he	looks surprised.					WESLEY			Data, the drive section...			where'd it go?8A   ANGLE - MAIN VIEW SCREEN (OPTICAL)	Only the asteroid remains on screen. The ship is	gone. Data reacts... looks at his sensors... looks at	the screen.					WESLEY			There's no sign of it on its			previous heading. Someone must			be at the helm.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Status report, Mister Data?	There's no beating around this bush.         STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - TEASER         6.8A   CONTINUED:					DATA				(simply)			I am afraid the prisoner has eluded			us, sir.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - ACT ONE        7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:9    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard and Riker have returned, are listening to Data's	explanation. Other personnel are there as before.					DATA			We followed procedures precisely.			Scanners indicated no life forms			present in the drive section.			I cannot explain how he escaped.					WORF			Incoming message from the Angosian			prime minister.					PICARD				(settling into the				 Command Chair)			On screen.10   ANGLE ON THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	The planet's surface is replaced by an image of	Nayrok, seated in his office.					NAYROK			We've identified the prisoner,			Captain. His name is Roga Danar.			His criminal record is too long			to go into. But you must be aware			that he is given to bouts of			uncontrollable violence.					PICARD			We appreciate the warning, Prime			Minister. We will keep you posted			on our progress.	The image on the viewscreen returns to planet.					RIKER			Mister La Forge, how far and how			fast can that transport ship			travel?        STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - ACT ONE        8.10   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Without warp drive, there's no			way it could be outside our range			by now.					WESLEY			We've been sweeping the area			constantly, Commander. There's			nothing within sensor range.	Picard frowns, frustrated. This annoying little space	gnat is turning out to be more than they bargained for.					PICARD			A cloaking device?					WORF			The Angosians have no cloaking			technology...					RIKER				(it dawns on him)			Unless he's borrowing one...				(off Picard's look)			If he's hanging over the planet's			pole, its magnetic field could			confuse the sensors.					DATA			I believe I can recalibrate our			sensors to read through the			electromagnetic interference over			the poles, Commander.					RIKER				(to Wesley)			Realign for polar orbit.					WESLEY			Aye, sir.	Data sits, his fingers dance over the keys on the	console. He looks at11   HIS MONITOR - COMPUTER GRAPHIC	of the planet, over the north pole, we can see magnetic	interference which Data tunes out, revealing an image	of a craft hovering there, hiding...        STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - ACT ONE        9.12   ANGLE					DATA			There he is, Commander. You were			correct.					RIKER			The fellow knows all the tricks,			doesn't he...	Data studies his console, confused.					DATA			There are still no life form			readings coming from the vessel.					GEORDI			It could be the magnetic			interference, Data.					DATA			I have compensated. There are no			readings.					PICARD			We'll have our answer shortly.			Lock on tractor beam, Mister La			Forge.					GEORDI			Tractor beam locking on.13   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The tractor beam shoots out from the Enterprise towards	the tiny half-ship, which begins to turn to face the	Enterprise.14   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Data checks his instruments.					DATA			Sir, the vessel is coming about.					RIKER				(looking over his				 shoulder)			Is he out of his mind?        STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - ACT ONE        10.14   CONTINUED:					WORF			Sensors detect a massive power			build up in his aft thrusters.					PICARD			On Main Viewer, Mister Worf.15   ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	The tiny ship is now facing the Enteprise. It is	slowly approaching within the tractor beam.					GEORDI			He's making a suicide run.					DATA			Shields have been automatically			activated. Tractor beam			disengaged.16   EXT. SPACE - THE TRANSPORT VESSEL (OPTICAL)	No longer enveloped in the tractor beam, the transport	vessel hurtles head on towards the Enterprise, then	skids off the invisible shield, away from the ship.17   INT. MAIN BRIDGE					WESLEY				(reacts)			He's bounced off our shields.					RIKER			That's one trick I didn't even			know about...					PICARD			Ensign Crusher, fix coordinates			of that vessel. We'll transport			the whole thing to a shuttlebay			if we have to.	Data has been working hard the whole time.					DATA			I do not think that will be			necessary, Captain. He is no			longer in the drive section.					(MORE)        STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - ACT ONE        11.17   CONTINUED:					DATA (Cont'd)				(reactions)			I anticipated this diversionary			tactic based on his pattern to			date. We are picking up a			cylindrical object approximately			seven meters in length and three			meters in diameter.					WORF			On screen, Captain.18   ANGLE ON THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	A tiny, cylindrical object is just visible.					WESLEY			An escape pod.					GEORDI			This guy is incredible.19   INT. MAIN BRIDGE					DATA				(puzzled)			Yet there are still no life form			readings.					PICARD			Transporter Room Four, prepare			to beam aboard anything that's			large enough to be a humanoid			adult from inside that pod.					WORF			Security to Transporter Room Four.					O'BRIEN'S VOICE			We are holding the contents in			stasis pending arrival of			security. An illicit weapon has			been detected in the transport			beam, sir. It's been rendered			inoperable.					RIKER				(to Worf)			Let's greet our guest.     STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - REV. 10/27/89 - ACT ONE     12.19   CONTINUED:	Riker and Worf disappear into the turbolift.20   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM	TWO ARMED SECURITY OFFICERS wait with the transporter	engineer. All eyes and weapons are trained on21   THE TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)	It glitters to life. An image begins to materialize.	ROGA DANAR stands before them. Haggard. On the edge.	A dangerous gleam to his eye, like a frightened,	trapped animal. Without wasting a second, Roga aims	his rifle and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.					SECURITY MAN			Just stay where you are.	Roga barely reacts... with the quickness of a snake	striking, he lunges off the transporter pad...22   WIDE - THE SECURITY MEN (OPTICAL)	fire their phasers... he's so quick, one shot misses	him... the other connects with him in mid-air but he	still lands on the security guard, takes him out,	rolling off him, hit by another phaser shot, growls	with pain, sags, then pulls himself back up and leaps	at the second guard...23   INT. TRANSPORTER CORRIDOR	They come crashing through from the Transporter Room...	Roga and the guard wrapped up together, fighting for	control of the guard's phaser... the transporter	engineer comes from behind, grabs Roga... who throws	him backwards hard against the wall...24   WORF AND RIKER	arrive...					RIKER			What the hell...     STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - REV. 10/27/89 - ACT ONE     13.24   CONTINUED:	Riker and Worf charge Roga... it's like two	linebackers trying to bring down a powerful running	back... and then the other two guards are on him too	and O'Brien... and it's a gang tackle... and finally	with all of their force, Roga goes down... pinned to	the floor.25   ANGLE - RIKER	He looks down at the enraged face of Roga still	struggling, helpless now.					RIKER			Take him to the detention cell.			Set phasers on kill.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                  STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - ACT TWO        14.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:26   EXT.

The prime minister on the main	viewscreen... Riker ENTERS during the conversation...	his arm repaired.					NAYROK			We need a few hours to get the			containment field on Lunar Five			operational before we pick him			up. The damage he caused during			his escape was considerable.					PICARD			We will await your signal.					NAYROK			I appreciate your patience.

He is			extremely violent and cunning,			as you already know, Commander			Riker. I'm so pleased to learn			your injuries are not serious.			My most sincere apologies...					RIKER			None required, Prime Minister.	Nayrok acknowledges.        STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - ACT TWO        15.26A  CONTINUED:					NAYROK			I will send a transport vessel			to retrieve him as soon as			possible. Nayrok out.	The screen returns to a view of the planet.26B  ANGLE	Riker moves to Data...					RIKER			Have you run a diagnostic on the			sensors, Data?					DATA			Yes, Commander. There is nothing			wrong with the ship's sensors.			The reason that we did not sense			any life signs aboard the escape			vessel is because the prisoner			has no life signs.	Picard and Riker exchange a glance.					RIKER			Computer, identify the occupant			in the detention cell.					COMPUTER			The detention cell is vacant at			this time.					PICARD			Can he be some sort of android?					DATA			Our sensors can identify			artificial lifeforms, Captain.			Apparently, he is capable of			deceiving the sensors.27   OMITTED28   INT. DETENTION CELL	High security is evident. A guard is stationed outside	the cell. The room is divided by a glowing rim,	indicating an activated invisible forcefield.        STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - ACT TWO        16.28A  CLOSE ON ROGA	Lying on a bed, Roga borders between consciousness and	unconsciousness. He tosses from side to side, tortured	by a nightmare.28B  INT. CORRIDOR (FORMERLY SCENE 27)	Troi walks down the corridor towards her quarters,	slows as she senses something.29   INT. DETENTION CELL	Roga's mental pain has intensified. His face is beaded	with sweat. He moans in anguish.30   INT.

DETENTION CELL	Roga's eyes open, he sits up abruptly on the edge of	his bed, recuperating from the demons of his	subconscious, turns to see Troi standing there outside	the divider. For a beat, he has to shake himself back	to reality... their eyes meet.					TROI			Are you all right?	He stares at her, considers the question... and may	not be entirely sure of the answer. Surprisingly,	Roga's manner is calm and circumspect, the antithesis	of the labels he has been given. There is no sign of	the violent nature he displayed in the Transporter	Room. If anything, he is detatched and cerebral.	He stands, looks around, disoriented.					ROGA			What is this ship?					TROI			You are on board the USS			Enterprise.					ROGA			A war vessel?        STAR TREK: "The Hunted" - 10/25/89 - ACT TWO        17.31   CONTINUED:					TROI			A Federation starship.					ROGA				(reacts)			Federation...					TROI			We were orbiting Angosia when you			escaped from Lunar Five.	He examines the force field around him, sticks his hand	out... the force field reacts.					ROGA			It seems I am a victim of my own			bad timing.				(examines her)			And you are the keeper of this			jail?					TROI			I am Deanna Troi.

A terrifying thought, isn't			it? Even to me.	A line which says a lot about his inner turmoil.
