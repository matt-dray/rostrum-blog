SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around a planet.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 42881.5.			We are in orbit around Antede			Three, awaiting the arrival of			two dignitaries from this world.2    INT.

Few			humans have ever seen an Antedian			in the flesh.	Picard nods at TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN who begins	the energizing process. The two delegates begin to	MATERIZLIZE on the platform...           STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER           2.4    REVERSE ANGLE ON ANTEDIANS	as seen from behind. They are dressed in flowing, red	robe-like garments with an attached hood which keeps	us from seeing their heads from here.					PICARD			Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard,			captain of the Enterprise.					WESLEY				(hesitates, then)			Are they alright, Captain?	Doctor Pulaski moves toward them with a medical instrument	in hand. She grimaces as she gets near their faces.					PICARD			No, this is their preferred way			of space travel.5    ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE ANTEDIANS	seen from the front for the first time. It is not a	pretty sight. Each mottled face resembles an oversized	catfish: huge gaping mouth, spindly whiskers, big fish	eyes, and a skeletal structure that gives them a	grotesque, unhealthy appearance. Their hooded, crimson	robes only emphasize their eerie, menacing appearance.	But what is really bizarre is that they're completely	motionless -- catatonic. A medium-sized container	arrives with them.	Pulaski methodically runs her medical instruments along	the Antedian's necks.					PULASKI			Their physical condition appears			good enough, considering the			circumstances.					PICARD				(to Welsey)			It is a self-induced catatonic			state. Their way of dealing with			the trauma of spaceflight.					WESLEY			Will we try to revive them?           STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER           3.5    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Not until we reach the Pacifica			conference. It's three days away.				(to Pulaski)			You've prepared Sickbay facilities			for holding them, Doctor?					PULASKI			As soon as we make some			adjustments. Their physiology			is unusual.				(to O'Brien)			Can you store them for a few			hours?					O'BRIEN			Aye. I'll have them kept out of			the way here.					WESLEY			What's in this container?					PULASKI			Their food. When they come out			of stasis, they will be very			hungry.5A   ANOTHER ANGLE	Wesley steps over to the container and lifts the cover.	It's filled with a writhing, squirming mass of	worm-like creatures.					WESLEY			This is what they eat?					PULASKI			In great quantities.5B   SCENE					PICARD				(to Worf)			Provide security.					WORF			Understood, sir.	Worf steps forward and looks at the Antedians	admiringly.          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER          3A.5B   CONTINUED:					WORF				(continuing)			What a handsome race.	The others look at Worf, wondering if he could possibly	be serious. And of course, he is.5C   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as she leaves orbit.6    INT. BRIDGE	The normal bridge crew are in their positions. Troi	is also there.					RIKER			What did you think of the			Antedians, Wesley?					WESLEY			Well, they are rather			strange-looking, Commander.	Picard ENTERS and walks to his position.           STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER           4.6    CONTINUED:					DATA			Judging a being by its physical			appearance is the last great human			prejudice, Wesley.					PICARD			A point well taken. I'm sure			that to the Antedians, we're			equally unattractive.					RIKER			It is interesting to consider just			how subjective "beauty" truly			is...					WORF			Captain... we're being hailed by			a small transport vessel just			coming into range.7    ANGLE EMPHASIZING TROI	As she suddenly stiffens.					TROI			Oh, my God!					PICARD			What is the problem?					TROI			What can she be doing here?					WESLEY			On the screen, Captain.8    ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	where the pilot of the shuttle is seen. He appears	to be a bit weary and nervous.					TRANSPORT PILOT			Starship Enterprise, come in!					RIKER			We have you on our viewer, Pilot.           STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER           5.8    CONTINUED:					TRANSPORT PILOT			Enterprise... I have a passenger			-- a V.I.P. passenger -- who I'm			ordered to --					MRS. TROI (V.O.)			Let me talk to them, Pilot. I'm			much more articulate.	The transport pilot seems relieved to step aside and	let the woman speak for herself.9    MOVE IN ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	as MRS. TROI slides into the picture.					TROI			Mother!					DATA			Captain, we are now receiving			Starfleet orders granting a			Lwaxana....					MRS. TROI				(overlapping)			Lwaxana Troi, daughter of the			Fifth House, Holder of the Sacred			Chalice of Riix, heir to the Holy			Rings of Betazed.					DATA			... full ambassadorial status,			sir.					RIKER			I'm afraid it's back into your			formal uniform, Captain.					DATA			And yours too, Commander. She			is listed as representing the			Betazed government at the			conference.					TROI			Mother, please don't do this to			me.           STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER           6.9    CONTINUED:					MRS. TROI			Do what to you, Little One?				(to Picard)			Oh, what naughty thoughts,			Jean-Luc. How wonderful you still			think of me in that way.10   ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER	looking at one another resignedly, preparing for the	worst.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:11   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - PICARD, RIKER AND TROI	as they ENTER, Picard and Riker now in formal full	dress. The Antedians, still catatonic, have been moved	to the side where a SECURITY GUARD stands with them.					TROI			It's so like my mother to do the			unexpected. She's famous for it.					PICARD			It will be nice to have her as			a guest of the Enterprise again.	Riker exchanges a look with Picard signifying some	reservations. Picard turns to Transporter Chief	O'Brien.					PICARD			Energize.12   ANGLE ON THE TRANSPORTER PLATFORM (OPTICAL)	as Mrs. Troi beams in. She is apparently kneeling on	the platform, hunched over and facing backwards...13   CLOSE ON MRS. TROI					MRS. TROI				(opening her eyes)			Aaagh! Where are my legs?!					TROI			Where they belong, Mother, Right			under you.	Mrs. Troi begins standing up.					MRS. TROI				(offhand)			Oh, wonderful. So they are!				(turning to Picard)			But I'll never completely trust			this device, Jean-Luc...          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          8.13   CONTINUED:					TROI			He's "Captain Picard," Mother...	Mrs. Troi has turned to where she suddenly sees the	"frozen" Antedians.					MRS. TROI			Aaagh!					PICARD				(to Riker, resignedly)			Explain.					RIKER			Sorry they startled you, Mrs.			Troi. These are Antedian			delegates... ah, temporarily being			stored here, I believe...					MRS. TROI			"Delegates?" The last time I saw			something like this, it was being			served on a plate.	Picard has to turn away to hide his smile at this. But	Riker enjoys it openly, especially her next line.					MRS. TROI				(continuing)			But you, Jean-Luc, I was not aware			you had such handsome legs. My			valet is waiting. You may beam			him aboard now.	Picard nods at the Chief O'Brien and in a second, a	larger figure MATERIALIZES. MISTER HOMN arrives carrying	Mrs. Troi's "suitcase". He breaks into that easy,	enigmatic smile of his as he looks around the room.					MRS. TROI			You remember Mister Homn, of course.					PICARD			It would be hard to forget Mister			Homn. Welcome back to the			Enterprise.	Homn nods toward Picard.          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          9.13   CONTINUED: (2)					MRS. TROI			I've retained his services despite			the outlandishly lustful thoughts			he spews in my direction. I			suppose the poor fellow just can't			help himself.	It's hard to believe Homn would lust after anyone.					MRS. TROI				(continuing; to Picard)			Perhaps you could show me to my			suite now?					PICARD			Certainly.	Mister Homn starts to pick up her luggage...					MRS. TROI			Put that down, Homn. We can't			deny the captain the honor of			carrying my belongings.	Picard looks at the beehive-shaped carrying-case. He	remembers the last time...					PICARD			I won't interfere with Homn's			duties this time.					MRS. TROI			That's not the real reason,			Jean-Luc. You forget I'm a			telepath.	Picard looks from Mrs. Troi to Deanna as Homn picks	up the luggage...					RIKER			Look, since this apparently has			some meaning to you, Mrs. Troi,			I'll...	Riker reaches in to take the luggage from Homn.					RIKER				(continuing)			...carry...it.          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          10.13   CONTINUED: (3)	Homn has released the luggage and the full weight of	it (with a MUFFLED CLANKING SOUND) is taken by Riker,	whose words have come out in a surprised GROAN.14   INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR	The others follow Riker who is trying his best to	"casually" carry the heavy bag down the hallway.	Picard, the Trois and Homn follow closely behind.					RIKER				(trying not to sound				 labored)			It's... just down this hall.15   EMPHASIZING THE TROI WOMEN	Deanna is glaring at her mother who is looking at	Riker's legs.					MRS. TROI				(telepathic)			He has nice legs too, Little One.			Is he still yours?					TROI				(telepathic)			Humans no longer own each other			that way, Mother.					MRS. TROI			Oh really?				(looks at Picard)			That's a custom we may have to			introduce again.16   INT. MRS. TROI'S QUARTERS - PICARD (OPTICAL)	as the Group ENTERS and Riker puts down the baggage,	SIGHS with relief.					MRS. TROI			Thank you.					RIKER			Glad I could help out.	Riker and the others EXIT, leaving Picard to face Mrs.	Troi alone.          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          11.16   CONTINUED:					PICARD			I trust you'll be comfortable			here, Mrs. Troi. Now if you'll			excuse me, I must get back to my			duties.					MRS. TROI			Captain, I will be serving a			Betazoid dinner of greeting			tonight. It is an ambassadorial			function.					PICARD				(after a hesitation)			Of course. It, uh, sounds			delightful.	Picard EXITS. Mrs. Troi speaks of him as she flutters	about, checking out the intricacies of her quarters...					MRS. TROI			He's a fine man. Solid. Earnest.			Reliable. Perhaps a little on			the dull side, but all in all he's			not bad.					TROI			I cannot believe you! You sound			like you're sizing up a commodity.					MRS. TROI			But that's exactly what men are,			darling. Especially human men.				(chuckles, strokes				 Deanna's face)			Was your father ever unhappy with			me?					TROI			No, he worshipped you, Mother.			But I'll never learn to see men			the way you do.          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          12.16   CONTINUED: (2)					MRS. TROI			You will as you mature, darling.			And the males in your life will			bless you for it.17   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - RIKER, WESLEY, WORF, DATA	Most of them are LAUGHING, except Data who is smiling	slightly. Even Worf seems almost amused.					WESLEY			... but it's true she complimented			Captain Picard on his legs?	Riker nods affirmative.					DATA			I would have thought a telepath			would be more discreet.					RIKER			No, it's just the opposite. She			knows what's in your mind and she			lets you know what's on hers.	More LAUGHTER -- which is suddenly stilled as they	realize that Picard ENTERED the bridge. Picard takes	his seat at command and speaks in a tone that's polite,	yet gets the point across -- enough of this	conversation.					PICARD			We must not lose sight of the fact			that we're talking about someone			who has been granted ambassadorial			rank. Even if she appears a bit			eccentric, Lwaxana Troi must be			treated with appropriate respect.			Is that understood?	The others make it clear that it is.          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          13.17   CONTINUED:					DATA			Our orders on her mentioned			nothing specific except...					PICARD				(waits)			Except what, Mister Data?					DATA			We are to cooperate with her as			fully as possible, deliver her			there untroubled, rested...				(seeing Picard's				 expression)			I assume those were merely			courtesies due her rank, sir.					PICARD				(to Riker)			See that every bridge officer and			supervisor has the full text of			that transmission.					RIKER			Aye, sir.18   EXT.

TRANSPORTER ROOM - CLOSE ON PULASKI	intently concentrating on reexamining the Antedians.					PULASKI			I'm doing so right now, Captain.					PICARD (V.O.)			Are they still catatonic?					PULASKI			Status of the beings is unchanged.			Pulse still steady -- respiration			normal for them.21   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - SAME SETTING					PICARD			Understood. Keep me informed --			Picard out.	Picard leans back in his chair, takes a deep breath,	and then rises.					PICARD			I believe I'll get some rest.				(exiting; to Riker)			It will be a dress uniform dinner,			gentlemen.					RIKER			Sir?	But PICARD EXITS.					DATA			Inquiry, Commander: to which			dinner was the captain referring?	Riker ponders the question.					RIKER			Nothing I've been invited to.			Have any of you?	Apparently no one has.					RIKER				(continuing)			Very interesting!          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          15.22   EXT. THE ENTERPRISE - FLYING BY AT WARP SPEED (OPTICAL)23   INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - PICARD	(back in formal dress) walks down the hallway with a	bottle of ice-blue Altairian brandy in his right hand.	As he rounds a corner he comes face to face with Doctor	Pulaski, going the other way.					PICARD			You're not attending the dinner			with us this evening, Doctor?					PULASKI			I've already eaten, Captain. But			thanks anyway.	We HEAR A CHIME.					MRS. TROI (V.O.)				(sing-song)			Come in!	The expression on Pulaski's face is interesting.24   INT. MRS. TROI'S QUARTERS - PICARD	ENTERS to find romantic lighting, with candle-like	objects spread about the room, and a small table made	up for two. Mrs. Troi is out of sight in an adjoining	room; Mister Homn is filling expensive-looking glasses	with what looks like wine.	Picard holds out the bottle -- Homn accepts it... and	then to Picard's surprise, he unscrews the top and	begins to drink straight from the bottle. Picard	starts to say something, but thinks better of it. In	a matter of moments, Homn drains the entire bottle!	The giant smiles at Picard and bows regally -- his way	of saying thanks.					PICARD			Tell me Mister Homn, when will the			others be arriving?	Homn stares back blankly.          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          16.24   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(continuing)			The other officers?				(pause)			Commander Riker? Deanna?	Homn shakes his head from side to side and smiles	mischievously. He points a long finger at Picard and	then points behind the Captain. Picard turns to see...25   MRS. TROI	leaning against the wall, wearing a sexy dress and a	provocative look.					MRS. TROI				(purring)			Hello, Jean-Luc.

I am			detecting large amounts of			ultritium.					MRS. TROI			Of course you are. They planned			to blow up the entire conference.	Worf has drawn his phaser.					PICARD			Take them to level five. Disarm			them and hold for questioning.              STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE             63.89   CONTINUED:	Worf leads the angry Antedians away -- they hiss at	Mrs. Troi as they pass by. Mrs. Troi gives Deanna a	hug and steps onto the platform, followed of course by	Homn.					MRS. TROI				(sighing)			Oh well, I didn't find a mate but			I saved the conference as well			as your reputations. All in a			day's work I suppose.					PICARD			Good-bye Mrs. Troi... and thank			you.	She closes her eyes and nods her head, showing she's	ready. Picard signals the transporter chief and Homn	and Mrs. Troi begin to DEMATERIALIZE. Suddenly she	opens her eyes and looks right at Picard.					MRS. TROI				(scolding, excited)			Jean-Luc! Shame on you for			thinking such a thing!	And they're gone. All eyes turn to Picard...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE
