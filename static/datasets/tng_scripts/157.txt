Beverly reports:					BEVERLY			The two scientists are suffering			from phaser stuns... I'd guess			several hits each.					PICARD			Several... when one would surely			have sufficed.					BEVERLY			It'll take us a while to bring			them around, but they'll recover.	She indicates the sample she's analyzing.					BEVERLY (cont'd)			We found a sample of blood. It's			a rare iron-copper composite,			unique to one humanoid species:			the Acamarians.					PICARD			Acamarians.				(a beat)			That would suggest... the			Gatherers.					DATA			A likely hypothesis. The nomadic			marauders who refer to themselves			as Gatherers have raided other			outposts in neighboring sectors.					RIKER			But they've never ventured this			far before.   STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE   5.6    CONTINUED:					PICARD			And we cannot permit them to			spread their violent ways further.				(keys insignia)			Mister Crusher, set course for			the Acamar system.					WESLEY'S COM VOICE			Aye, sir.									CUT TO:7    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Assuming orbit around a planet -- Acamar Three.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 43562.9.			In an effort to put an end to the			Gatherer raids, we have come to			the Acamar System to enlist the			aid of Marouk, the sovereign of			Acamar Three.8    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Picard, Riker, TROI. At the head of the table sits an	imposing, aristocratic middle-aged woman: MAROUK,	sovereign of Acamar.	Standing unobtrusively behind Marouk is a beefy male	BODYGUARD.	Acamarians are humanoid, perhaps a bit unkempt and	primitive (in appearance, not in intelligence) by our	standards.   STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/6/89 - ACT ONE   6.8    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Their raids have made this sector			unsafe. Our research facilities			have been ransacked; trade routes			disrupted...					MAROUK			The Gatherers are elusive; we've			only managed to capture a handful			of them. However, with			Starfleet's help...	She's got the wrong idea. Picard interrupts sharply:					PICARD			Hunting them down is not what			I'm proposing.					MAROUK			Reconciliation with the Gatherers			is impossible. It's been tried.			Every time we've offered amnesty,			they've rejected it.					TROI			When was the last attempt made?					MAROUK			Eighteen years ago.					PICARD				(surprised)			Eighteen years?					MAROUK			Yes. We gave up trying.					RIKER			Why?					MAROUK			Because the Gatherers aren't			willing to change! For almost			a century, they've been			parasites... moving from star			system to star system, living on			what they could find... or steal.			They're little more than			barbarians.					PICARD			They are still your people.   STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/6/89 - ACT ONE   7.8    CONTINUED: (2)					MAROUK			No. Captain, you have to			understand our history. A hundred			years ago, before the Gatherers			split off from our culture, we			were a savage, violent race.			Clans battled clans... bloody,			vengeful feuds that lasted for			generations.				(a beat)			But we overcame those ways...			broke the cycle of fighting and			revenge. All except the			Gatherers.					TROI			After a century of wandering,			they may be ready to come home.					PICARD			Despite all your progress, your			society is still divided. And			it will remain so until the			Gatherers return to Acamar.	Picard's words have had an effect. Marouk thinks it	over.					MAROUK			The attempt may be futile.	Picard stands.					PICARD			You have much to gain and little			to lose in making the effort.			The problem affects us all... it			cannot be ignored.	Marouk looks at Picard, grudgingly nods. She knows	he's right. STAR TREK: "The Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/2/89 - ACT ONE 8.9    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Data, Wesley, Worf, supernumeraries. Picard, Riker,	Troi, Marouk, and the bodyguard ENTER from the	Observation Lounge.					PICARD			Sovereign Marouk, how soon will			you be ready to leave Acamar?					MAROUK			I am ready now, Captain. I need			only bring aboard two more			servants...					RIKER			I'll see to that... and to your			accommodations, Sovereign.	Marouk nods a thank you to Riker, turns to Picard:					MAROUK			I have reason to believe there			is a Gatherer encampment somewhere			in the Hromi Cluster.					PICARD			Mister Data?					DATA			The Federation has charted but			not explored several Class M			planets in that area. Any of			those planets might well serve			as a base.					PICARD			Mister Crusher, set course for			the Hromi Cluster.					WESLEY			Aye, sir.10   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	leaving its orbit of Acamar Three.11   INT. GUEST QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	as Marouk ENTERS, followed by Riker. She crosses to	the port, looks out at the stars as the ship goes into	Warp. An impressive sight. Marouk turns to Riker:   STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE   9.11   CONTINUED:					MAROUK			A fine ship, Commander.					RIKER			We're very proud of her.	In b.g., the bodyguard and two more servants ENTER,	carrying suitcases. One new arrival is a middle-aged	female MAID.	The other is YUTA, a fragile girl in her early	twenties; pretty, with a delicate, quiet manner. Like	all Marouk's servants, if she has a personality it's	invisible.12   NEW ANGLE	as Yuta sets down the suitcase, looks up. Her eyes	happen to meet Riker's. A friendly smile from Riker.	Some women would turn away, blushing shyly; some would	smile back in friendship -- or invitation. Yuta does	neither -- just looks incuriously at Riker. No	reaction at all.					MAROUK (O.S.)			Yuta --13   WIDER (OPTICAL)	as Yuta turns to Marouk.					MAROUK			A light meal in twenty minutes.	Yuta nods in obedience, but Marouk has already turned	away to look out the port at the stars streaking by.14   ON YUTA (OPTICAL)	approaching Riker. In b.g., the other servants are	unpacking the suitcases.					YUTA			May I be shown to the kitchen,			Commander?   STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE   10.14   CONTINUED:					RIKER			You're the chef?					YUTA			Yes. I'll prepare all meals for			the sovereign and her servants.					RIKER			We can provide you with a kitchen			if you wish... but it's not really			necessary. The food dispensers			can synthesize anything you want.	Yuta absorbs this without reaction. Riker leads Yuta	to a food slot.					RIKER (cont'd)			I'll show you.				(to Marouk)			Sovereign, may I offer you a			drink?	Marouk doesn't turn from the port:					MAROUK			Yes, thank you. Cold water.					RIKER				(to food slot)			A glass of water... five degrees.	A glass of water MATERIALIZES in the food slot. Yuta	shows mild interest. Riker takes the glass, starts	to deliver it to Marouk. Yuta politely blocks him,	extends her hand for the glass.					YUTA			Please.	Riker's about to say "it's all right, I'll do it" --	but there's something immovable about her stance. He	hands her the glass. She sniffs it, calmly takes a	sip. Riker doesn't know whether to be amused or	horrified.					RIKER			You're also the food taster?	Yuta looks at him -- what's so odd about that?   STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE   11.14   CONTINUED: (2)					YUTA			That's part of the cook's duties.	Satisfied she hasn't been poisoned, Yuta takes the	glass to Marouk, who accepts it without comment. Yuta	returns to Riker.					YUTA (cont'd)			I'm sure the sovereign will wish			to sample many of the cuisines			your ship has to offer, but there			are certain Acamarian dishes she			will insist upon.					RIKER			I'll arrange for a technician to			help you program your recipes			into the computer. I'd like to			try some myself. What's your			specialty?					YUTA			I have none.	A simple statement of fact. Riker smiles at her. His	natural good will and charm would melt an ice cap.					RIKER			Don't be modest. You can't tell			me you haven't come up with a			few original triumphs...	And, wonder of wonders, Yuta smiles back. Not much of	a smile... but it's a start.					YUTA			There is a spiced parthus dish...					RIKER			"Parthus?"					YUTA			A green vegetable with fleshy			roots.					RIKER			Ah. Parthus... a la Yuta. I			look forward to tasting it.					(MORE)   STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/6/89 - ACT ONE   12.14   CONTINUED: (3)					RIKER (Cont'd)				(to Marouk, taking his				 leave)			Sovereign...	But Marouk's still gazing with fascination out the	port, doesn't hear him. Riker turns back to Yuta,	gives her a respectful nod:					RIKER (cont'd)			Chef...	Riker exits. Yuta's small smile increases a bit.	Servants don't get this sort of attention; she's not	quite sure how to respond... but she likes Riker.15   EXT.

MAIN BRIDGE	Picard, Riker, Troi, Data, Wesley, Worf.					WESLEY			Entering standard orbit of Gamma			Hromi Two, sir.					DATA			I am detecting life readings on			the surface, sir... and several			small areas of heat and carbon			dioxide emission indicative of			combustion.					WESLEY			Campfires, Data.					RIKER				(to Picard)			It's worth a look.					PICARD			Make it so.17   EXT. GATHERER CAMP - NIGHT (OPTICAL)	Riker, Worf, GEORDI, and Data MATERIALIZE in the midst	of a "junkyard" of high-tech equipment scattered about.  STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/10/89 - ACT ONE  13.17   CONTINUED:	Worf scans the area with his tricorder as Geordi, Data	and Riker inspect the various piles of stuff.					GEORDI			Artonian lasers, Tonkian homing			beacons... quite a collection.	Data looks at a pile of scrap metal.					DATA			Noranium alloys. Their salvage			value is low.					RIKER			Looks like the Gatherers aren't			very discriminating in what they			steal.	Worf looks over the array, then announces with disgust:					WORF			The spoils of animals without			honor.	Worf lifts a tarp on another pile.					WORF (cont'd)			Commander.	Riker, Data, and Geordi step up to examine Worf's find	-- a small reactor.18   CLOSE ON WORF	frowning suddenly. He sniffs the air, then grabs	Riker, Data, and Geordi, pulls them to the ground --					WORF			Ambush!19   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as THREE GATHERERS (BRULL, TEMAREK, and one n.d.) --	armed with phaser rifles -- pop out from behind a ridge	and take aim at the away team. (Like their Acamarian	cousins, the Gatherers are muscular humanoids with a	"primitive" appearance -- belied by their sophisticated	weapons.) They FIRE.   STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE   14.20   ON RIKER, WORF, GEORDI, AND DATA (OPTICAL)	as a PHASER BLAST just misses them.21 WIDER (OPTICAL)	Data, Riker, and Geordi scramble behind some rocks as	Worf provides a BLAST of cover FIRE, then he too finds	cover.22   ON RIKER (OPTICAL)	his back against a rock, and phaser in hand.					DATA			Rigellian phaser rifles. Not very			powerful.	Another BLAST scorches the rock nearby.					RIKER			Powerful enough...									FADE OUT.					END OF ACT ONE  STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/10/89 - ACT TWO  15.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:23   EXT. GATHERER CAMP - NIGHT (OPTICAL)	As before. The three Gatherers have positioned	themselves well -- Riker, Data, and Geordi are pinned	behind a cluster of equipment while Worf is behind	another. Riker yells to the Gatherers:					RIKER			We want to talk --	A phaser BLAST from the Gatherers confirms they aren't	interested in chatter.24   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as Worf moves closer to Riker, Data, and Geordi --	his adroit maneuvering sparing him from a phaser HIT.					WORF			Your words are wasted, Commander.				(holding up his phaser)			They understand only this.					RIKER				(convincing himself as				 well)			We're here to establish a			dialogue.	A phaser bolt STREAKS OVERHEAD.

Of course,			noranium carbide alloys vaporize			at a slightly higher temperature.	Riker indicates the pile of alloys -- Worf, Data, and	Geordi catch on.					GEORDI			Phaser setting seven ought to do			it...	Riker nods; all four adjust their phasers.25   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as Riker, Data, Geordi, and Worf FIRE at the pile of	noranium. The noranium quickly bellows huge clouds of	SMOKE -- filling the area almost immediately.					RIKER			Now!25A  ANGLE	In a quick moment, Riker gives the others sotto voce	instructions, then using the smoke as cover, the four	make a break for it.26   ON THE GATHERERS (OPTICAL)	trying to peer through the smoke. We hear:					RIKER (O.S.)			Enterprise -- four to beam up!			Energize!	Brull, the Gatherer leader, sneers with contempt.					BRULL			Cowards.	Brull turns his attention to the rising smoke. He	grabs a bucket of sand and pours it on the noranium.	The two others Gatherers follow suit. After a beat,	the smoke ceases.  STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/11/89 - ACT TWO  17.27   ON BRULL	as he breathes a sigh of relief -- his precious loot	not completely lost.	As the smoke clears --28   ANGLE ON RIKER, WORF, DATA, AND GEORDI	emerging from the smoke -- phasers aimed at Brull and	the two Gatherers.					WORF				(to Brull)			Your ambushes would be more			successful if you bathed more			often.	Brull GRUMBLES, but he knows there is nothing he or	his Gatherers can do.					RIKER			We've brought the sovereign of			Acamar...					BRULL				(surprised)			Marouk... here?					RIKER				(nods)			With an offer of amnesty.	Brull and the other two Gatherers are curious, but	suspicious.									CUT TO:29   OMITTED30   EXT.

Brull frowns					BRULL			You don't trust me.					MAROUK			Should I?	Marouk passes the chalice to Brull.					BRULL			Oh, but you expect me to trust			you. Perhaps you just poisoned			it yourself.	He gruffly hands the chalice to Temarek... all this	for show...					BRULL			Taste it.	Temarek looks and says who me?
