MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE	Full complement of crew at stations, DATA at OPS, GEORDI	at CONN. RIKER and TROI are flanking PICARD.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			... to engage in a friendly visit			and open treaty negotiations to			acquire this medicinal substance.					GEORDI			Standard orbit, sir.					RIKER			Lieutenant Yar is calling from			Cargo Bay One, sir. Standing by			to beam Ligonian welcoming party			aboard.					PICARD				(rising)			On our way. You have the helm,			Mister Data.	Picard leads Riker and Troi into FORWARD Turbolift.3    INT. TURBOLIFT	as Picard, Riker and Troi ENTER and the door HISSES	closed behind them.          STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/9/87          2.3    CONTINUED:					PICARD				(continuing; toward				 controls)			Cargo One.				(to Riker and Troi)			Should be an interesting			experience.					RIKER			Agreed. Not only are they closely			humanoid but their history has			remarkable similarities to ours.					TROI			But a highly structured society			and they're exceedingly proud.4    INT. CARGO DECK (OPTICAL)	Picard, Riker and Troi ENTER. Tasha is waiting there	with a pair of SECURITY GUARDS -- one with a tricorder.					TASHA			They've insisted on using their			own transporter device, sir...					PICARD				(nods)			It's their way, Lieutenant. Do			they have our coordinates?	Tasha indicates cleared area ahead of them on the Cargo	Bay deck.					TASHA			They have, sir. Precisely. And			they're standing by for your			signal.					PICARD			This is Captain Picard of the			Starfleet vessel Enterprise.			Please...				(looks to Troi; she				 nods)			... please do us the honor of			visiting our vessel.	After only a moment, a slightly different kind of	TRANSPORTER EFFECT materializes five people. There are	four extremely tall, elegant Black Guards who form a	square.             STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87             3.4    CONTINUED:	They are bare-waisted with metal collars -- each with a	centered jewel -- and each wears a hakama (starched,	baggy trousers pulled between the legs).	Each has at least one major scar, and each carries a	bo (a bojutsu fighting staff). Each wears as headgear	a red, braided rope in a circular crown. One carries	a rolled carpet. They face forward at attention, but	their eyes take in everything.	The fifth person materializing is HAGON, who carries a	dull metallic box. He bends down and kicks the carpet	so that it unrolls towards Picard.	Then, LUTAN beams into view. He stands a moment, tall,	magnificent and with flashing eyes. His dress is more	elegant, his jewel more resplendent. The Security Guard	with the tricorder scans the party quickly, then nods to	Tasha.					TASHA				(quietly to Picard)			Nothing concealed, sir.	Lutan steps forward. He looks about him for a moment.					LUTAN			I am Lutan.	Picard moves to greet him, raising both hands in the	customary Ligonian greeting to show one is not holding	a weapon. Lutan nods, satisfied, and smiles. Without	touching, he holds his hands up in a like manner.					PICARD			Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome			aboard. These are my officers.			Second in command, Commander			William Riker; Ship's Counselor			Deanna Troi; my security officer,			Lieutenant Tasha Yar.					LUTAN			A woman? Your Chief of Security?					PICARD			Yes, Lutan: that is her expertise.	Lutan and Hagon exchange a near-amused look. Then Lutan	turns to Picard.             STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87             4.4    CONTINUED: (2)					LUTAN			I am honored to meet your			officers.				(indicates Hagon)			And this is my Secondary, Hagon.				(indicates)			A sample of the vaccine.	Hagon steps forward with the metal box, extending it	to Picard. But Tasha steps forward to take it.					TASHA			My duty, Lutan.	Almost before the words are out of Tasha's mouth, Hagon	grabs for the box.					TASHA				(continuing)			Sorry, I am required to inspect...					HAGON			Aside, little one...	Hagon whirls toward Picard forcing Picard to step back	to avoid contact, but Tasha reacts protecting her	Captain, with it ending in Hagon being flipped onto his	back. Lutan's guards step forward menacingly but are	stopped by a gesture from Lutan. Hagon looks up from	his prone position, more puzzled than anything else.					HAGON				(continuing)			This... this is a woman?					LUTAN				(inspecting Tasha)			How interesting!				(then, to Picard)			May we prove as surprising to you.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/9/87          5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:5    INT. CARGO DECK - FULL SHOT	Same principals in approximately the same positions as	last SCENE.					TROI				(low voice)			If I may suggest, sir...	She indicates for the Enterprise people to move back	and give Lutan and his people room and also time to	recover. In just above a whisper:					TROI				(continuing)			No apology. In their view, it			would weaken us.6    EMPHASIZING LUTAN	Unlike Hagon and the Guards, he's beginning to enjoy	this as Riker picks up the container Hagon had been	holding, examines it and extends it to Picard.					RIKER			Nothing concealed, Captain.				(extends it)			Do you care to accept it?					HAGON			Yes, yes, please do.					LUTAN				(to Tasha)			Unless you care to examine it			further.7    CLOSER GROUP SHOT	Picard seeing it is time to turn on the charm.					PICARD			Absolutely not. This vaccine			sample is a gift of life and we			are honored at receiving it.				(indicates way into				 vessel)			Will you do us the honor of			letting us entertain you now?          STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/10/87          6.7    CONTINUED:					LUTAN				(nodding)			You may prepare it. We will join			you shortly.	With nothing else to do, the Enterprise group LEAVES the	immediate area. They're not fools -- security people	remain in sight. Lutan and Hagon move closer together,	speak in low tones.					HAGON			I ask forgiveness....					LUTAN				(cuts him off)			They are strange alien things.			You bear no fault...					HAGON			But the female...					LUTAN			May be exactly what I've needed.8    INT. LOUNGE - FULL SHOT	Data, BEVERLY and Troi are seen ENTERING, Data carrying	a magnificent bronze horse. Picard stands next to	Lutan.					PICARD			Lutan, we're aware of many of your			planet's achievements, and its			unique similarity to an ancient			Earth culture, which we all			admire. On behalf of the			Federation, therefore, I am proud			to present to you this token of			gratitude and friendship. From			China's Sung Dynasty, Fourteenth			Century.					DATA				(to Picard)			Thirteenth Century, sir.					PICARD			Indeed?         STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/10/87         6A.8    CONTINUED:					LUTAN				(accepting and admiring				 it)			It is a most thoughtful gift.			We are grateful.	Lutan hands the horse to Hagon. Then, while watching	Tasha with interest:          STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/10/87          7.8    CONTINUED: (2)					LUTAN				(continuing)			We from Ligon have always been			apprehensive about strangers.			We are not as technologically			advanced as you; yet we possess			something you do not -- a vaccine			which has been found to be an			effective antidote to your deadly			Anchilles fever. If your conduct			toward us is worthy -- if you			respect our customs -- and if we			see this respect -- we will			become friends. Then, we will			make the vaccine available to all			who need it.	Everyone APPLAUDS. Lutan is proud and dignified. He	sweeps the gathering with his eyes, which hold on Tasha.9    CLOSE SHOT - TASHA	She meets his gaze with confidence.10   BACK TO FULL SHOT	The room quiets down as Picard rises.					PICARD			If you require respect from us,			I'm certain you will see it.					LUTAN			Surrounded by such friendship,			I have no need of my guards.				(to guards)			I will return shortly. Prepare			to transport me then.	The Guards signal obedience, begin EXITING. Picard and	the others are puzzled by this.             STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87             8.10   CONTINUED:					PICARD			If there is something else, any			final courtesy...					LUTAN			Is it possible to see one of your			wondrous holodecks? We have heard			how they are used to train your			officers.	Picard exchanges a quick, concerned look with Riker and	Troi.					PICARD			And used for many other things			too.				(turning)			Commander Riker, perhaps you and			Counselor Troi can demonstrate.					LUTAN			Is it possible for Lieutenant Yar			to do so Captain? Some			demonstration of defense training?					RIKER			We've noticed you are intrigued			by her having security			responsibilities. But such things			are not at all unusual with us.					HAGON			With us, it is the duty of women			only to own the land, and the duty			of men to protect and rule it.					TROI				(amused)			Much the same has happened in			human history too.	Picard smiles, then turns to Tasha questioningly. She	nods.					TASHA			I'd like to do it, sir.				(to Lutan)			As a sign of respect, perhaps.					PICARD				(nods agreement)			Very well.	Tasha beckons to Lutan and Hagon.             STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87             9.10   CONTINUED: (2)					TASHA			This way, please.	A couple of Enterprise Security Guards follow.11   INT. HOLODECK - FULL SHOT - OPTICAL (SPLIT SCREEN)	Tasha, followed by Lutan and Hagon, plus the two	security team members, who stay in the b.g. Tasha moves	to the wall controls. She punches in some commands,	reaches for an aikido jacket from a peg, then walks to	a bare area. She gives a CODED COMMAND.					TASHA				(continuing)			Aikido. One.	An Aikido Opponent MATERIALIZES (DISSOLVES IN) ON A MAT.	The IMAGE remains rigid, immobile. The visitors are	much impressed.					TASHA				(continuing; amicably)			It won't move until my actions			activate it.12   CLOSER ON GROUP	Lutan stepping in to examine the Aikido Opponent,	amazed.					LUTAN			You can create people? Without			a soul?					TASHA			It's not a real person, Lutan.			It has no life. Everything it			does is controlled by computer.	She moves close to the image.					TASHA				(continuing; to the				 image)			Who am I? Do you hear me?	The image doesn't move. But when Tasha suddenly feints,	the image instantly blocks the blow.            STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87            10.12   CONTINUED:					TASHA				(continuing)			But it will feel real when it hits			you.	She crouches and the IMAGE crouches, and they begin to	fight. After rapid and savage exchange, she throws the	IMAGE.13   EMPHASIZING LUTAN	His eyes begin to glow as he evaluates what he sees,	watching with growing interest.					HAGON			A force like that cannot possibly			come from an image, Lutan.					LUTAN			Then you will show me, Hagon.	Hagon hesitates, but he has his order. He moves to the	mat as Tasha steps aside.14   ACTION ANGLE	Hagon crouches, the image crouches. Hagon deftly makes	two feints, and then a move and is promptly dumped hard.	There's no doubt about the pain he feels.					HAGON				(trying to breathe)			Oh. . . . Oh...					LUTAN				(to Tasha)			Thank you, Lieutenant. How very			enlightening.15   CLOSER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Behind Tasha the IMAGE RISES and stands, remaining	quiet.					TASHA				(into the air)			Aikido, vanish.	The IMAGE DISSOLVES. Tasha goes to the panel, shuts	down the controls, takes a towel from the wall, wipes	off, and removes her jacket.            STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87            11.15   CONTINUED:					TASHA				(continuing)			I could create two -- even three,			but one is really enough. As you			fight with it, it learns, and			before long it knows exactly how			to defeat you.					LUTAN				(a smile)			Even the extraordinary Lieutenant			Yar?					TASHA				(also a smile)			It forces us to keep improving.	Lutan's eyes are glowing as he nods.					LUTAN			Your skill impresses me. I like			you.	Lutan shows a definite reaction to Tasha, and she	reacts to him similarly. Picard notices both	reactions.16   INT. CARGO DECK - FULL SHOT (OPTICAL)	Our Enterprise participants are all present with Lutan	and Hagon. Good-byes are being exchanged.					LUTAN				(continuing)			Farewell, my new friends of the			noble Enterprise.					PICARD			Understanding has made friends			of many different people. We've			had a good beginning, Lutan.					LUTAN			May I also extend a personal			farewell to Lieutenant Yar?	Picard nods. Tasha moves forward. Lutan extends his	hand to her.					LUTAN			In your Federation terms.            STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87            12.16   CONTINUED:	Tasha takes his hand and shakes it. Lutan puts an arm	around her as if to hug her. Releasing his first hand,	but still holding her, he reaches up and touches the	jewel at the center of his necklace. In an instant	their images SHIMMER, and they are gone.					PICARD			Picard to bridge. Red alert!									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                    STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/7/87          13.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:17   INT.

MAIN BRIDGE	as all wait for some communication from the planet.					RIKER				(to Geordi)			Do we know the source of their			transporter beam?					GEORDI			Our own transporter people tried			to trace it, sir, but without			effect.					DATA			It reads similar to Starfleet's			early efforts but uses the			Heglenian shift to convert matter			and energy in different...				(stops; seeing Picard's				 expression)			... which is actually not			important at this time.					PICARD				(touching panel com)			This is Captain Picard of the			Enterprise with a message to Lutan			whom I have so far acknowledged			as a friend. But you have now			committed what our laws regard			as an attack upon us, Lutan. And			having visited us here, Lutan,			you must certainly understand the			power of our vessel. We have so			far fired only a warning burst			at you. We insist you reply to			this message.	They again wait. Finally Picard turns to Troi:					PICARD				(continuing)			Opinion, Counselor. Will they			injure Tasha?          STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/9/87          15.19   CONTINUED:					TROI			I believe not, sir. In fact, they			seem mainly curious. But in the			case of Lutan I did feel other			needs.					RIKER			What kind of needs?					TROI			Some sexual attraction from all			the males. Lieutenant Yar is			physically very attractive. But			I felt something else in the case			of Lutan... something more like...			avarice or ambition.	All puzzle at this.					PICARD			Other comments?	Data turns to Picard.					DATA			If I may, sir... one of the things			about them in the briefing studies			was their respect for patience.					RIKER				(nods)			Strongly emphasized. And you can			see it in the precise, ritualistic			way they do things. I'm worried			about Lieutenant Yar too, sir,			but maybe we should sit and wait			them out.	Picard considers this, then nods. He turns to Troi and	Data:					PICARD			Analysis, the two of you.			Everything we know about them and			how these happenings fit into			that.20   EXT.

CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM	Beverly ENTERS, joins Picard waiting inside. She's	very upset.					BEVERLY			The vaccine, sir...					PICARD				(rises)			Yes, Doctor?					BEVERLY			The vaccine...				(stops; shudders)			I'm a... physician; I've seen death.			But not on the scale this could			mean.					PICARD			Meanwhile, you were testing			whether we can replicate the			vaccine...					BEVERLY			And we can't! Their sample			works fine when used as an			injection, but it becomes unstable			when we try to replicate it. You			must get vaccine from the planet,			Captain. As much as you can.			Immediately!         STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/16/87         17.22   CONTINUED:					PICARD			I'm aware of that, Doctor.					BEVERLY			You've never had to watch a			patient die from this disease.					PICARD			That's true. But I've seen my			share of death.					BEVERLY			Damn!				(weak smile; shakes her				 head)			Where are the calluses we doctors			are supposed to grow over our			feelings?					PICARD			Perhaps the good ones never get			them.	Beverly moves toward the exit, then stops and turns,	eyes him for a long moment.					PICARD				(continuing; hopeful)			Yes, Doctor?					BEVERLY				(hesitates; then)			May I speak about my son Wesley?					PICARD				(startled)			What?				(recovers)			Well, yes. Yes, of course.					BEVERLY			He's so interested in starship			operations. And...				(smiles)			... speaking as a mother, of			course, he seems quite			knowledgeable.         STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/16/87         17A.22   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Well, yes... speaking as a			mother...					BEVERLY				(indicates;				 interrupting)			He's on the turbolift. You'll			remember you ordered him to stay			off the bridge.	The whole subject upsets Picard but he feels trapped	now. And Beverly is remarkably lovely. He finally	motions for her to follow him toward the bridge.          STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/9/87          18.23   INT.

In the b.g. at the turbolift, WE'LL	SEE Wesley quickly flatten himself almost out of sight.	But Picard keeps looking in that direction and this	fact finally forces Wesley SOMEWHAT INTO SIGHT.24   ANGLE ON TURBOLIFT	Wesley finally comes more fully INTO VIEW and meets	Picard's eyes.					WESLEY				(weakly)			I haven't stepped one foot on your			bridge, Captain...25   WIDER ANGLE	As the other turbolift arrives, from which Riker,	Data, and Troi ENTER to see Picard in an apparent	confrontation with Wesley.

Counting coup could be			as simple as touching an enemy			with a stick in battle, or taking			something from him and escaping.			It was considered extremely			heroic.					RIKER			And under these circumstances			Lutan considers himself heroic,			risking literally everything in			the face of our superior power.					TROI			And it fits Lutan's personality			profile as well. He has an			abnormally high need for			achievement -- I've sensed it in			him, very strongly.	Picard nods.          STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/9/87          21.28   CONTINUED: (2)					TROI				(continuing)			We should establish clearly also,			that Lutan is dangerous.

A single,	simple, brilliant banner identifies this an important	place, and whatever design elements are visible reveal	an interest in the abstract, perhaps a Mondrian-ish	feeling. Two sentries are posted beside a doorway.	Picard and Troi BEAM INTO SHOT. Lutan and Hagon come	from inside the doorway and exchange the "empty hands"	ritual greeting with Picard.					LUTAN			Welcome to my Centerplace, Captain			Picard. Consider yourselves my			honored guests.					YAREENA (O.S.)			Every hospitality will be accorded			you.	ADJUST ANGLE to include YAREENA, who has just joined	them.

Her only flaw being her passionate,	unreasoning love for Lutan.					LUTAN			This is my First One, Yareena.					PICARD			Lutan is a fortunate man.	She smiles graciously, but remains a bit behind him,	according to custom.					PICARD				(continuing)			You've met Counselor Troi.					LUTAN			Yes.				(to Picard)			As on your vessel, you have only			to name whatever courtesy we can			provide.					PICARD			Then, sir... the courtesy of			seeing Lieutenant Yar.            STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87            26.34   CONTINUED:					LUTAN			Lieutenant Yar will be returned			to you tonight at a banquet I have			arranged in your honor.					PICARD			I would like to see her now.					LUTAN				(thinks; then, to a				 sentry)			Bring Lieutenant Yar.				(to Picard)			I find it odd, Captain, that a			man of your experience has such			difficulty in understanding			ordinary politeness.					PICARD			Such as saying "please" when			abducting someone?					LUTAN			The expression "please" is used			only when requesting the person			back.					PICARD			Yours is a different world.					LUTAN			With clear and simple ways deeply			rooted in our culture. If you			are willing to ask for Lieutenant			Yar's release tonight in front			of all, honor will be satisfied.					TROI				(to Picard)			One can see the importance of			"honor" here.					LUTAN			Honor is everything.	Picard and Troi exchange looks.					HAGON			There will be gifts for each of			you, to absolve the abduction.            STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87            27.34   CONTINUED: (2)	Tasha is brought to the doorway between four guards,	with every sign she would break free at the slightest	opportunity.

Then:					LUTAN			I thought for a moment I heard			a threat implied.				(shrugs)			But that would be foolishness.					PICARD			Something to be carefully avoided			I agree.					LUTAN			The festivities for her return			to you are in preparation. Shall			we retire until then?	Lutan gestures to the guards, who move to take Tasha	OFF, without resistance.

PICARD'S QUARTERS - NIGHT	The room is similar to Tasha's, but less elegant and	much smaller. Picard paces.					TROI			Captain, I'm your counselor.

Do you judge your			condition good?	From the door a LOUD KNOCK.					TASHA			I judge it excellent, sir.	Another KNOCK, insistent. Picard nods to Geordi who	opens the door. It REVEALS Hagon with TWO GUARDS who	carry two lacquered boxes each. The four boxes (the	SIZE OF HAT-BOXES) are labeled one through four by	ornate dot patterns. The boxes are placed on a low table.					HAGON			Your weapons, Lieutenant Yar.			You may pick your size.	They EXIT. Tasha goes slowly to the boxes, and opens	first one and then the others. She picks one glavin up	and holds it for the others to see. They look at it	with awe. It is a gauntlet-length oversized glove, the	bulbous and almost basketball size. On the inside of	the wrist a down-curved claw projects. Out of the glove	itself stick a profusion of slender eight-inch long	needles, as if from a porcupine. A thin transparent	shield covers them. Tasha removes the cover.56   CLOSE SHOT - THE GLAVIN IN TASHA'S HANDS	revealing the above details, but without any poison	demarcation.              STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/9/87              48.56   CONTINUED:					GEORDI (V.O.)			Don't touch the spines! They're			poisoned.57   OMITTED58   BACK TO SHOT	Tasha looks at the glavin carefully, hefts it, touches	it, estimating it. Geordi comes over and looks at it	with her.					GEORDI			If you're not careful you could			kill yourself.					TASHA				(looks at spines; shakes				 head)			These I understand.	From outside, they HEAR a metallic CLANGING. They stop,	and go to the window.59   THEIR POV OUTSIDE - NIGHT	Outside, in the CENTERPLACE, the sharpened lengths of	steel have been vertically attached within a multi-level	rectangle. A number of these poles have horizontal	segments connecting them. Yareena, wearing workout	clothing, is maneuvering quickly from level to level,	carefully avoiding the sharpened spikes. She wears the	glavin on her left hand only, and uses the claw to give	her leverage while swinging over and under the	horizontal bars. It's obvious, as she climbs and jabs	and slashes out, that she's very good at this. She	never makes a mistake; the projecting needles never	touch a pole, and she never makes a misstep. Below her,	eight metallic objects outline the boundary of the	arena. Between each of these, perhaps twenty inches off	the ground, a brilliant green LIGHT BEAM defines the	outer limit of the rectangle. As a workman puts the	finishing touches on this apparatus, four additional	green LIGHT BEAMS suddenly appear, emanating straight	upward, from the four corners of the centermost section.	To check them, he interrupts one of the beams with a	stick of wood. It SIZZLES and begins to BURN.              STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/9/87             48A.60   BACK TO SHOT	They look at one another.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                                       STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/7/87              49.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:61   EXT.

CENTERPLACE - NIGHT	The Centerplace is alive with a gathering group of	official spectators, who are seating themselves around	Lutan and Hagon. Picard, Troi, Geordi, followed by	Tasha and a guard, ENTER SHOT. Tasha wears the	glavin with its protective covering. We begin to HEAR	A RATTLE of ivory-like sticks from the Spectators.					TASHA				(to Picard)			Any last minute instructions, sir?              STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/10/87             51.64   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(nods; then)			Stay alive. We'll hope to do the			rest.65   ANGLE TO INCLUDE YAREENA	as she ENTERS with a Female Aide. LOUDER LIGONIAN	RATTLING. A Guard motions Yareena and Tasha into the	combat area. A worker prepares to activate the	light-beam boundary. When it's quiet, Hagon rises	and addresses the gathering.					HAGON			I speak for Lutan. The rules are			known; let combat continue until			there is a victor. It will not			be interrupted.				(looks at combatants)			Proceed.	Again a RATTLING OF STICKS as Tasha and Yareena ENTER	the structure at opposite sides. The worker ACTIVATES	the LIGHT-BEAM boundary. Then SILENCE from the	Spectators as Tasha and Yareena immediately begin	working their way through the structure.66   CLOSER ON THE COMBAT - NIGHT - (INTERCUT WITHSPECTATOR REACTION)	Tasha goes quickly for the center to defend from there,	not sure exactly what to expect. Yareena, very sure of	herself, climbs with agility. The glavin never gets too	near her body. The glavins CLANG as each of the women	climbs.67   CLOSE ON YAREENA	Her eyes bright, her expression cold. She appears to	always figure at least one move ahead.68   CLOSE ON TASHA	learning as she goes. She makes her moves without	flare, steadily and carefully feeling her way. At the	moment, it looks as if she's no match for Yareena.              STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/9/87              52.69   ON THEM BOTH - COMBAT SQUARE ONLY	Yareena suddenly speeds up, agily climbing higher than	Tasha. Gracefully, she also circles to get behind her.	Tasha turns barely quickly enough to defend herself.	Stopping, darting away, and coming from unexpected	angles, Yareena forces Tasha to change position. Tasha	at first clambers horizontally, then, aware of what's	happening, climbs higher to get away from her, but can't	do it without turning her back.	Yareena jabs out at her, managing to drive and corner	her on the highest level of the arena. Again she jabs	with her glavin, just missing. There's a GASP from the	audience. Yareena inches closer, leaning out and	continuing to jab.70   ANGLE ON LUTAN	Not at all as unconcerned as he indicates to Picard.71   CLOSE ON TASHA	Tasha folds her arms and dives beneath the horizontal	pole, landing on her feet -- but loses her balance, and	falls within the innermost section.72   BACK TO SHOT	Instantly, Yareena climbs toward her for the kill. As	she raises her glavin to strike the final blow, her arm	extends too far back, causing a metallic section of the	glavin to brush against one of the brightly glowing	vertical LIGHT BEAMS. This results in a shower of	SPARKS and a reactive force so strong that it throws	Yareena's arm forward with such speed that the glavin	is hurled out of the arena and into the first row of	spectators.73   ANGLE ON LUTAN	Lutan rises, shouting.					LUTAN			Combatants, hold your positions!				(he turns to a guard)			Return the weapon!              STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - REV. 7/9/87              53.73   CONTINUED:	Yareena and Tasha remain stationary as a smiling	spectator, into whose lap the glavin has fallen,	gingerly hands it to the guard. His smile quickly turns	to a grimace of horror as he notices a thin line of	blood on his thigh. His face contorts as the poison	instantly takes effect. As the glavin is carefully	returned to Yareena, WE SEE two sentries removing the	spectator's body.74   CLOSE ON THEM BOTH	With Yareena re-armed, Tasha aggressively advances	toward her.75   ANGLE ON HAGON	Very concerned now.					HAGON			Yareena! Careful!76   ANGLE ON ARENA	Tasha moves rapidly to the outside, drawing Yareena up	to follow her, then simulates losing her balance and	fake-falls, flailing, toward the ground. She appears to	be caught on the lower rungs without being able to free	herself. Yareena drops deftly to her feet alongside	her, stands over her and is about to shove the deadly	spines of the glavin into her when Tasha kicks out with	her foot, catching Yareena's leg. Yareena stumbles.	Tasha gets to her feet and hurls herself at Yareena,	getting on top of her. Her claw grazes Yareena's	shoulder, ripping her garment and causing blood to flow.                 STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87                54.77   ANGLE EMPHASIZING YAREENA	staring in horror at the thin TRAIL of blood. She	starts slowly to rise up. The spectators gasp, waiting	for Yareena to die.78   ANGLE EMPHASIZING TASHA (OPTICAL)	as she suddenly throws herself bodily across Yareena	and both of them begin to SHIMMER -- and then are BEAMED	AWAY.79   FULL SHOT	The crowd rises to its feet in surprise, then anger and	SHOUTING. They begin to throw their ivory-like sticks	toward the arena, then at our Away Party which quickly	moves to one side, standing close.80   INT.

She appears to be almost	dead -- perhaps completely so. Tasha removes her own.	Beverly moves forward to administer a hypo to Yareena.					TASHA			We're too late; she's growing			cold.					BEVERLY			Sorry that clashes with my			instructions...	The hypo administered, Beverly begins monitoring Yareena	on the medical tricorder.81   CLOSE ON YAREENA	Not a pretty angle since she indeed looks dead.82   CLOSE ON TASHA	Horror stricken at what she has done.                 STAR TREK: "Code of Honor" - 7/2/87                55.82   CONTINUED:					TASHA			On no, no...83   INT.

On the table there is the fateful glavin,	medical tricorder and instruments. Accepting what he	sees, Lutan reacts angrily.					LUTAN			She is not dead! There was no			death combat; you have violated			our agreement. There will be no			treaty, no vaccine... !					PICARD			The challenge was carried out.			She died, Lutan.					LUTAN			There was no challenge!
