My first officer			has taken an away team down to			make contact and they are in the			process of returning to the ship.5    COMMAND AND HELM AREAS	Picard looking to Troi.					PICARD			Riker has sounded very enthused			in his reports.					TROI				(nods)			He says the planet has life forms			almost identical to us.	Interrupted by Beverly who ENTERS, obviously with much	on her mind.					BEVERLY			Captain... !				(sees she has				 interrupted)			Sorry, Troi.	Troi smiles, beckons Beverly in.					TROI			The Doctor has something much more			important on her mind, Captain.					BEVERLY				(frowns; to Troi)			Please, Troi, do not pick up my			feelings!					TROI			Your feelings? All we need			are ears.           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - TEASER           3.5    CONTINUED:					PICARD				(smiles to Beverly)			You've been talking about it for			days now... Shore leave for the			crew.	Beverly sees that her son Wesley has also thrown her	a concerned look. She gives an apologetic nod to Troi.					BEVERLY			I'm tired myself.				(to Picard)			Establishing that colony has			exhausted the entire crew, sir.			We're not a supply vessel.			Settling all those people was a			strain on everyone.	RIKER interrupts by ENTERING with DATA, GEORDI, TASHA.	They all register enthusiasm, giving the replacement	crew nods, smiles, thumbs up gestures as they take over	their positions. Riker has continued straight to	Picard, acknowledging Troi and Beverly too.					PICARD			Is it as good as your reports,			Number One?					RIKER				(enthused)			Exactly per my reports, sir.			Class M, so Earthlike, so			beautiful, it will startle you!					BEVERLY			It sounds wonderful for the			children!				(to Picard)			The Holodecks are marvelous, of			course, but nothing like giving			them open space and fresh air...	Beverly takes a simulated deep breath of air.					TASHA			I've listed my report on their			customs and laws, sir. Fairly			simple, common sense things.           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - TEASER           4.5    CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			Wild in some ways, puritanical			in others. Neat as pins,			ultra-lawful, and making love at			the drop of a hat.					TASHA			Any hat.					PICARD				(smile)			But even the happiest report has			its negatives. Let's start with			them.					RIKER				(grins)			There are none, sir. Not that			any of us can find.					DATA			But there is a problem here, sir!	Data is puzzling over readings at his station.					DATA				(continuing)			I do not understand this at all!					WORF				(to Picard)			It's the faulty reading I			reported, sir.					TASHA			Sensor technicians are working			on it, sir. They've identified			it as a "glitch" in the system.	Picard turns back to Riker.					PICARD			I take it you find no "glitch"			at all in this planet, however.					TASHA			If you approve shore leave, sir,			we could start with a small group			at first.           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - TEASER           5.5    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			Of course...				(turns)			Wesley, if we go, you will join			the away team to evaluate this			world as a place for young people			to relax.					WESLEY			Yes, sir!	He glances at Beverly to note her smiling approval of	this.					PICARD			If all scans and observations			confirm the reports...				(nods)			... certainly I'll approve it.				(beat)			Let's hope it is not too good			to be true.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                     STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE           6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:6    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN PLANET ORBIT (OPTICAL)	The same lovely planet.					PICARD (V.O.)			We are in orbit of a planet			designated Rubicun Three... and			have found it to be the home of			a life form who call themselves			the Edo.7    EXT. SURFACE OF RUBICUN THREE (OPTICAL)	The planet is as described. We are at an inhabited	part of it... clean, neat, the "streets" appearing more	like a running track, bordered with flowers. The	TRANSPORTER EFFECT brings in our new away team of Riker,	Troi, Tasha, Worf and Wesley. In the near distance, a	group of very human appearing people have seen them	arriving and two of them turn and race in this direction.	Worf is quickly aware of it and prepares to interpose	himself protectively.					WORF			Careful, sir...					RIKER			It's all right, Lieutenant, these			are the Edo we met.8    ANGLE ON THE EDO	ARRIVING at high speed. A young female and male who,	like other Edo we'll meet, are both tall, full haired,	with even white teeth, great bodies. They're also	dressed in loose, sexy clothing and these two wear a	silvery necklace indicating high rank. Riker is	watching an attractive Edo woman, saying:					RIKER			They certainly are... fit, right?	Troi is looking at an Edo male.           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE           7.8    CONTINUED:					TROI			They certainly are.					RIVAN			Health and happiness!					LIATOR			A pleasant day to you!	Troi gives Riker an even sharper second look as the Edo	ARRIVE and RIVAN, the woman, gives Riker a close and	rather intimate hands-on hug which, although it touches	upon the sensual, also combines genuine friendship, too.					RIVAN			You did return as promised!	The man, LIATOR, is looking over Troi and Tasha with	healthy interest. Like Rivan, although slim and very	well muscled, he has a quiet dignity that fits well with	this necklace-badge of leadership.					RIKER			Rivan, Liator...				(indicating)			Also from our vessel is Troi...					LIATOR			Slowly, slowly...				(embraces Troi)			I must also welcome this lovely			one...				(embracing Tasha)			... and this lovely one...	Riker waits, watching with interest until Tasha	disengages. She understands his look.					TASHA				(smiles)			My pleasure.					TROI			Healthy sensuality, sir. I feel			mainly happiness and friendship.					RIVAN			And I welcome this huge one...				(hugs and fondles Worf)			... oh, yes, yes...           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE           8.8    CONTINUED: (2)					WORF				(pleased)			Nice planet!	Rivan moves to Wesley, stops quizzically.					RIVAN			But you are a young one. I do			not know your custom regarding			love.	Wesley is clearly nervous, although intrigued too. He	clears his throat:					WESLEY			Uh... I guess... whatever you			usually do...	Rivan shows excellent taste, giving Wesley a "hug" but	without any "extras."					RIKER			Others would like to visit here			too. If you'll tell us what			limits you'd place on the			number...					LIATOR			Whatever pleases you. We can			discuss it at the Council			Chambers.					RIVAN				(to Riker)			Shall we go there now or remain			and play?					RIKER			Play?					RIVAN			At love. Unless you don't enjoy			that.				(to Worf)			Perhaps you do?					LIATOR				(to Troi)			And you? Yes, I can see that you			do.           STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE           9.8    CONTINUED: (3)					WESLEY			Listen, maybe I'll just go on			ahead...					RIVAN				(indicates Wesley)			This is unfair to him.				(to Wesley)			We'll go to the Council Chambers.			You'll find young people your age			there.					WESLEY				(warily)			Well... I really can't make any			promises...					LIATOR				(laughs)			You don't have to. Our rules are			simple. No one does anything			uncomfortable to them.					RIVAN			Come! Our people will want to			know you.	Then she turns back, glancing at the more formal	clothing worn by the humans.					LIATOR			Rivan, perhaps they...can't...run.					WESLEY				(to Riker)			Can't run? Sure we can run, right			sir?					RIKER				(to the others)			That's the custom here, running...				(to Wesley)			Right! Lead the way!	Rivan, Liator, and Wesley LEAD OFF, the Others JOGGING	AFTER them.          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE          10.9    TRUCKING - EMPHASIZING RIKER AND WORF	who find themselves out in front of Tasha and Troi.					RIKER			"When in Rome... ," eh?					WORF			When where, sir?	CAMERA HOLDS as the Group runs past.9A   EXT. SECOND SCENIC LOCATION	Rivan and Liator leading the Enterprise people along	another lovely pathway where an elderly but very trim	FIRST EDO CITIZEN and a pair of younger N.D. EDO	CITIZENS see them coming and break into a run to join	them. Lots of smiles and waves.9B   TRUCKING - EMPHASIZING AWAY TEAM AND FIRST EDO CITIZZEN	The Enterprise people very much taken with the joy and	good health they're seeing. First Edo citizen notes	Tasha's light complexion and amazon form.					FIRST EDO CITIZEN			Good health to you!					TASHA			Happiness to you!				(to Troi)			It's like an "Eden" here.10   EXT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS	A combination of conference and recreation facilities,	lots of light and air and spectacularly healthy looking	people in revealing but comfortable garb. SOUND of	delighted ADULT LAUGHTER from inside the chambers too.	Two adults and a child DEPART on the run, another older	woman ARRIVES -- on the run too. She doesn't seem to	be breathing very hard at all.11   ANGLE ON RIKER AND TEAM	ARRIVING on the run with their Edo companions. They	haven't done too badly. Rivan stops, looks Riker and	the Enterprise people over, then moves in and embraces	Riker again.          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE          11.11   CONTINUED:					RIVAN			Good health! I thought you might			be out of breath.	A SHRIEK from children at play, several Edo children	race INTO SIGHT.					LIATOR			Children, we've brought you a new			friend!					FIRST EDO BOY			Hello! Join us!					EDO GIRL			Yes, please!	Wesley joins the smiling children.					RIKER				(grins)			We may surprise you in a lot of			ways.12   INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS	The kind of place you'd like to visit. No particularly	formalized furnishing plan -- it includes just about	any way anyone would like to sit or loll. The same sort	of revealing but sensible garb here too -- along with	good humor. In fact, joy is what is mainly present	here. Lots of fruit, nuts, food and drink selections.	A MUSIC GROUP of Harpists in sight -- admittedly	strange looking harps on which they compose, and now	and then PLAY LILTING MUSIC which, like everything else,	is not taken too seriously here either.					RIVAN			Everyone! We've brought the			visitors!					LIATOR				(gesturing to away team)			Please enjoy what we have!13   EMPHASIZING ENTERPRISE PEOPLE	as they are taken charge of with great hospitality.          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE          12.14   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)	The same lovely planet.15   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	as Data ENTERS bridge from the turbolift, strides	rapidly toward his station, his face reflecting concern.					DATA			I have traced it through all sensor			channels, Captain! It is not a			glitch... !	Picard becomes alarmed at Data's tone, follows him to	the Ops station where Data begins going over readings	again.					DATA				(continuing)			... or any other form of error or			malfunction, sir.					GEORDI			Confirmed by my readings, sir.			It's like a "shadow something"...					DATA			Exactly! As if it's not entirely			in or out of our dimension.					PICARD			"What" is, Commander?	Data points off to front starboard of the vessel.					DATA			Whatever is sitting out there			without triggering our alarm			relays, Captain.					PICARD			Center Main Viewer on that area.16   ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	as the IMAGE there shifts slightly, but REVEALS nothing	but the planet and star background previously seen.          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE          13.16   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(to Data; continuing)			I need more, Commander.	Data seems stumped for a moment, then:					DATA			Permission to go to hailing			frequencies, sir?	A puzzled Picard nods.					DATA			Hailing frequencies open. On all			frequencies and language forms,			send...				(beat)			Enterprise to Object off our			starboard bow. Request that you			identify yourself!	As suddenly, the "what" begins appearing -- A HUGE AND	COMPLEX LOOKING OBJECT, A BIT SMALLER THAN THE	ENTERPRISE. IT IS HALF-TRANSPARENT BUT PARTLY SOLID,	TOO, AND VERY DEADLY LOOKING. A VESSEL? PERHAPS, BUT	SEEMINGLY MORE, TOO. WE WILL LEARN THAT IT SOMEHOW	EXISTS HERE AND IN ANOTHER CONTINUUM AT THE SAME TIME.	At the moment it appears, the Enterprise RED ALERT with	KLAXON comes on too.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                    STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO          14.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:17   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND MYSTERY OBJECT (OPTICAL)	The partially transparent Mystery Object as described,	positioned very close to the starship Enterprise. Its	very nearness implies threat.18   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	The Red Alert lights FLASHING, the KLAXON SOUNDING a	couple more times, then going SILENT. The mystery	object IMAGE is on the Main Viewer; Picard and the	others are as we last saw them.					GEORDI			Shields and deflectors up full,			sir. Main phaser banks ready.					PICARD			Hailing frequencies? Any reply?					DATA				(puzzled)			It was something unintelligible,			Captain. Now running it through			our logic and language circuits...					PICARD			Have a real look at it, Geordi!					GEORDI				(hurrying for the				 turbolift)			Aye, sir.					TASHA			Sir, my sensors read it... well,			as "half there." And it does			look...	She hesitates. Data finishes her thought.					DATA			As if it's partly...transparent.          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO          15.18   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Data, what the hell is it?	It is rather frightening to see Data turn to his	Captain... slowly shake his head.18A  INT. STARBOARD LOUNGE - (OPTICAL)	Geordi ENTERING on a run, racing to the first large	port, from which the mystery object/vessel thing can	be seen from here too. He stands examining it. Then:					GEORDI			Lieutenant La Forge to Captain.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Go ahead, La Forge. What can you			make out?					GEORDI			This is something I've never			seen before, sir.18B  INT. MAIN BRIDGE - COMMAND AREA - (OPTICAL)	Picard intent upon:					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			It's as if it isn't entirely in			our dimension, sir.					PICARD			Anything else?					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Negative, sir. It's something			I don't understand.					DATA				(to Picard)			I have some information on its			first transmission, sir. It			translates as...				(looks up)			... "stand by."          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO          16.18B  CONTINUED:					CONN CREWMEMBER			Sir! Sensors show something			emerging from that... that ship,			if you want to call it that.					DATA			Verified. Something very small...19   EXT. SPACE - ON MYSTERY OBJECT (OPTICAL)	REVEALING A TINY PINPOINT OF LIGHT having come out of	the side of the mystery object (no hatchway visible)	CROSSING orbital space toward the Enterprise.20   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Data watching Main Viewer.					DATA			Getting smaller...21   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Still smaller now, the PINPOINT OF LIGHT moves toward	the starship then actually passes through its "solid"	side.22   INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)	Several crewpersons stopping, astonished at the sight	of what this CLOSER VIEW shows as the SWIRLING BLOB	OF LIGHT comes INTO SIGHT near the corridor deck and	passes on an upward diagonal path of EXITING VIEW near	the ceiling beyond. (It is on its way to the bridge.)23   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	where Conn is reacting to an alarm from his panel.	Geordi RE-ENTERS bridge, takes his position.					CONN CREWMEMBER			Intruder alert, sir! But I			don't...				(puzzled)			... show a location...          STAR TREK: "Justice" - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO          17.23   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(to Geordi)			Why a tiny swirl of light,			Lieutenant? Could you make out			anything else?					GEORDI				(puzzling; looks up)			No, sir. Perhaps it is meant to			seem "non-threatening" to us.					DATA				(interrupting)			The away team signal has been cut			off, Captain! We are no longer			in contact with our people!	Conn is very puzzled over a reading at his station.					CONN CREWMEMBER			Intruder relays do show			something...	He hesitates, puzzled.					PICARD			Why has everything become a			something, or a whatever?	He gets his answer as the tiny SWIRLING LIGHT OBJECT	COMES INTO VIEW. It is about the size of a 'light bulb'	now, moving more slowly than before. COMING IN ON AN	UPWARD ANGLE THROUGH THE DECK, IT STOPS NOW, SUSPENDED	IN THE MID-BRIDGE AREA.24   ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA (OPTICAL)	Picard has come to his feet, watching as the TINY	SWIRLING LIGHT OBJECT which moves in his direction, and	STOPS. Picard has tried not to retreat before the	mysterious thing, but it is with some difficulty. Conn	has moved in holding a large hand phaser ready, but	has gotten a headshake from Picard.
