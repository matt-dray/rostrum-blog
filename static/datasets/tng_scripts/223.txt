SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Dropping out of warp speed as it enters a star system.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 45854.2.			The Enterprise is charting six			star systems that make up the			Argolis cluster, an area being			considered for colonization.2    INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	PICARD, RIKER, and TROI are in the command area, DATA	at ops, WORF at tactical; various SUPERNUMERARIES fill	the other posts as needed.	A star fills the VIEWSCREEN -- solar flares leap out	from its surface. All watch the beautiful pyrotechnic	display except Data, who is taking sensor readings.					RIKER			Very impressive...					TROI			It's beautiful... and frightening			at the same time.					DATA				(reading console)			Radiation bursts from the star's			surface are making precise sensor			readings difficult. It seems to			be exhibiting gravitational			instability.	Riker and Troi share a smile -- Data's scientific	perspective precludes his appreciating the beauty of	what they're seeing.         STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/5/93 - TEASER         2.2    CONTINUED:					DATA			The star's fluctuations are too			severe. It would be impossible			to settle any of the planets			in this system.	When no one acknowledges his report, he turns and looks	behind him. Everyone is watching the bursts of fire	that snake up from the star's surface.					DATA			I suggest we proceed to the next			system. Its sun is a stable main			sequence star.					PICARD			In a moment, Mister Data.	Data looks at their faces, then to the viewscreen.	He realizes what is going on, then returns to what he	finds more interesting: the sensor readings. After	a moment:					DATA			Sir, I am detecting a			transmission... emanating from			within this system					RIKER			What kind of signal?					DATA			It is self-repeating... of unknown			pattern.					PICARD			Where is it coming from?					DATA			A small moon orbiting the fourth			planet.					PICARD			Life signs?         STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/5/93 - TEASER         3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			Indeterminate. I am attempting			to screen out sensor			interference...				(he manipulates a few				 controls)			Readings are still inconclusive;			however, the moon's atmosphere is			capable of supporting life.					RIKER			Then it could be a distress call.	Riker looks to Picard, who nods briefly.					RIKER			Helm, take us into transport			range.				(to com)			Doctor Crusher, we need a medical			away team in transporter room two.					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE			Acknowledged.	Riker heads for the turbolift, nodding for Worf to	follow.3    EXT. THE CRASH SITE - TWILIGHT (OPTICAL)	PAN ACROSS a snowy, frozen landscape to take in the	scattered wreckage of a crashed spacecraft -- charred	metal and ship's innards litter the area. The AWAY	TEAM (BEVERLY, Riker, Worf) MATERIALIZES in the	foreground. Beverly scans with her medical tricorder.					BEVERLY			I'm reading one life form... very			weak signs.	She follows her readings toward the heart of the	wreckage.4    CLOSE - BEVERLY	she sees something...         STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/5/93 - TEASER         4.5    WIDEN	to reveal a person's legs emerging out from under some	debris. She gestures for Riker and Worf to help her	and they lift it off.6    ANGLE - BEVERLY, RIKER AND WORF	as they see the survivor's face for the first time.7    ANGLE - THE SURVIVOR	We understand why they reacted as they did -- the	survivor is a Borg...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE        5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            8    EXT. THE CRASH SITE -- MOMENTS LATER	Beverly is scanning the survivor's still form; she	checks a reading and administers the appropriate hypo.	The Borg is an adolescent male -- one of his arms is a	mechanical prosthetic, as is one of his eyes. Riker	stands, his face is troubled. Worf has already drawn	his phaser; Riker raises a hand that it's all right,	then keys his combadge.					RIKER			Riker to Enterprise.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Go ahead, Number One.					RIKER			We've found the wreckage of a			small craft... and one survivor.9    INT. BRIDGE					RIKER'S COM VOICE			It's a Borg.	Picard's features seem to darken.					RIKER'S COM VOICE				(continuing)			Male, adolescent -- he's badly			hurt.	When Picard says nothing:					DATA			There is no indication of other			Borg activity within sensor range.	Picard betrays no sign of having heard him; he is	weighing the options. After a moment:					PICARD			Away team, prepare to return to			the ship.          STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - 3/03/92 - ACT ONE          6.10   EXT. THE CRASH SITE	Riker and Beverly react.					BEVERLY			We can't leave him here, he won't			survive.	When Picard doesn't answer, Riker steps in:					RIKER			I think the captain understands			that.					BEVERLY			Then I don't.					RIKER			The Borg usually collect their			dead --					BEVERLY			He's not dead --					RIKER			And that transmission --					BEVERLY			-- at least not yet --					RIKER			That transmission we intercepted			was probably a homing signal.			We have to assume they're on their			way.					BEVERLY				(acknowledging this)			At least let me stabilize his			condition, give him a chance of			surviving until they get here.	Riker can't ignore this plea.					RIKER			Captain?11   INT. BRIDGE - ON PICARD					PICARD			Your concern is noted, Doctor.			But any intervention on your part			would only alert the Borg to our			having been here.        STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE        7.12   EXT. CRASH SITE (OPTICAL)	Throughout this exchange, Beverly has never stopped	treating the Borg.					BEVERLY			I'm afraid we've already turned			that corner.	She passes a wound-sealer (OPTICAL) over the Borg's	forehead as she says this, closing a nasty gash and	stopping the bloodflow.					WORF			Kill it. Now. We could make it			appear that it died in the crash			-- leave no evidence that we were			here.	Worf's solution is harsh, but it has the virtue of	showing what's at stake here. Without waiting for	a reply, he moves off to investigate the surroundings.	Riker waits for the captain's reaction.13   INT. BRIDGE	Picard doesn't like either of his options.	Reluctantly, he chooses to allow Beverly to continue.					PICARD			Security measures must be taken			before we beam it on board.14   EXT. CRASH SITE	Relieved, Beverly smiles, and continues her	ministrations.					BEVERLY			Standing by...15   INT. BRIDGE					PICARD			Mister Data, notify security to			prepare a detention cell.				(to com)			Bridge to engineering.        STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE        8.15   CONTINUED:					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			La Forge here.					PICARD			We're bringing a Borg survivor			on board. We'll need to			neutralize the homing signal --16   INT. ENGINEERING	GEORDI at a science station.					PICARD'S COM VOICE				(continued)			-- prevent it from sending or			receiving transmissions of any			kind.					GEORDI			I'll set up a subspace damping			field around the detention cell.17   EXT. CRASH SITE -- A FEW MINUTES LATER	Worf has discovered several other dead Borg scattered	among the shuttle debris. He returns to Riker and	Beverly, who is still treating the injured Borg.					WORF			There are four others. None			survived.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Picard to Riker.					RIKER			Go ahead, Enterprise.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			We're transporting you directly			to the detention cell.					BEVERLY			I need him in sickbay --					PICARD'S COM VOICE			The cell, Doctor. Whatever			equipment you need will be brought			to you there.	Beverly doesn't like it -- but backs down.        STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE        9.17   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Very well.17A  INT. BRIDGE	There is a moment as Picard accepts this; then, without	a word, he stands and EXITS to his ready room. Troi	looks after him for a beat, then rises.17B  INT. READY ROOM	Picard is rounding his desk as the door CHIMES. He	stops, glances toward it, seems mildly irritated.					PICARD			Come.	The door opens and Troi comes in. Picard continues on	to his chair and busies himself with his monitor.					TROI			Captain... I just wondered if			there's anything you wanted to			talk about.					PICARD			I don't think so, Counselor.	A brief pause as he continues to fiddle with his	monitor. Troi understands this man well... how	difficult it is for him to acknowledge weakness.					TROI			I would have thought that			having a Borg on the ship would			stir some feelings...					PICARD			I am quite recovered from my			experience, thank you.					TROI			Sometimes... even when a victim			has dealt with his assault...			there are residual effects of the			event that linger. You were			treated violently by the Borg...			kidnapped, assaulted, mutilated			--        STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE        10.17B  CONTINUED:					PICARD			Counselor --	Hearing his own somewhat sharp tone, he checks himself,	sees Troi looking at him imperturbably.					PICARD			Counselor, I very much appreciate			your concern for me. But I assure			you, it is misplaced.	He glances at Troi, still watching him.					PICARD			I have carefully considered the			implications of having this Borg			on the ship. I have weighed the			possible risks, and I am convinced			we've done the right thing.				(beat)			I am quite comfortable with my			decision.	He is, of course, avoiding how he feels about the Borg	-- an omission of which Troi is quite aware.					TROI			I see. Well, if at any point you			want to talk more...					PICARD			I will certainly avail myself of			your help.	But he has shut her out. She EXITS, sensing that the	captain has some rough times ahead.18   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around the moon.       STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/09/92 - ACT ONE       11.19   INT. THE DETENTION CELL (OPTICAL)	Picard approaches Geordi, Worf, and two SECURITY	PERSONNEL who stand outside the force field. A NURSE	is just entering the cell.					WORF				(to Security Guard)			Lower the force field.	The force field briefly flares to let her through, then	is reinstated. Beverly is already inside, working on	the Borg. As Picard approaches, Worf addresses him.					WORF			Captain, the Borg is still			unconscious.	Beverly looks up at Picard. His face shows nothing of	what he might be feeling.					BEVERLY			He suffered massive internal			injuries. We've got the			hemorrhaging under control, but			some of the implants in his brain			were damaged. I may have to			remove them.					PICARD			The Borg will die if they're			removed permanently. Their brains			grow dependent on the biochips.					BEVERLY			Perhaps Geordi could construct			new implants...					GEORDI			They contain relatively			straightforward programming,			interface protocols... we have			the files we downloaded after your			experience, sir. I think I could			manage it.	Picard muses for a moment... turning something over	in his mind.					PICARD			Mister La Forge... do you have			enought knowledge of Borg			programming to alter the pathways			to the root command structure?         STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE 12-13.           19   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			I'm not sure, sir. The			subroutines are pretty			complicated... I'd probably have			to study their data processing			algorithms... that's the only way			I could trace the access codes.	Picard turns, looks for a moment at the	still-unconscious Borg.					PICARD			If we could get to the root			command... we could introduce an			invasive programming sequence			through its biochip system...			and then return it to the hive.					GEORDI				(getting it)			The Borg are so interconnected			it would spread like a virus.					PICARD			Until it infected the entire			Collective. We could disable			their neural network in one			stroke.					BEVERLY			Infected... it sounds like you're			talking about a disease.					PICARD			Quite right, Doctor. And if all			goes well, a terminal one.	Picard's demeanor is icy; Geordi, Beverly and Worf	have mixed reactions as:20thru	OMITTED21                                             FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                 STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT TWO       14.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:22   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Riker, Data, Beverly, and Troi; Picard and Geordi have	just finished explaining their plan. Of the group,	Beverly has the most troubled response.					GEORDI			If this works the way I think it			will, once the invasive program			starts spreading, it'll only be			a matter of months before the Borg			suffer total systems failure.	There is a silence at this. Picard looks around the	room.					PICARD			Comments.					BEVERLY			A question. What, exactly, is			"total systems failure?"	Data doesn't recognize the sarcasm in her voice, and	so answers her straight.					DATA			The Borg are extremely			computer-dependent. A total			systems failure will destroy			them.					BEVERLY			I just think we should be plain			about that. We're talking about			annihilating an entire race...					PICARD			Which under most circumstances			would be unconscionable. But as			I see it, the Borg leave us little			choice.					RIKER			I agree. We're at war.        STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT TWO        15.22   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			There's been no formal declaration			of war...					TROI			Not from our side. But certainly			from theirs. They've attacked			us in every encounter we've had.					PICARD			They have declared war on our way			of life. We are to be			assimilated.					BEVERLY			Even in war, there are rules.			You don't kill civilians			indiscriminately.					RIKER			There are no civilians among the			Borg.					PICARD			Think of them as a single,			collective being. Any one Borg			is no more an individual than your			arm or your leg.					BEVERLY			How convenient.	Picard fastens his eyes on her.					PICARD			Your point?					BEVERLY			When I look at my patient, I don't			see a collective consciousness...			I don't see a hive... I see a			living, breathing boy... who's			been hurt and who needs help.			And we're talking about sending			him back to his people as an			instrument of destruction.	Picard turns from her.       STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT TWO       16.22   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			It comes down to this: We are			faced with an enemy that is			determined to destroy us, and with			whom we have no hope of			negotiating peace. Unless that			changes, we are justified in doing			anything we can to survive.					SECURITY GUARD'S COM VOICE			Security to Captain.					PICARD			Picard, here.					SECURITY GUARD'S COM VOICE			The Borg has regained			consciousness, sir.	Reactions...					PICARD			Acknowledged.				(stands)			We will proceed as planned.23   INT. DETENTION CELL (OPTICAL)	The Borg is moving along the perimeter of the detention	cell's wall, feeling his way, looking up and down as he	covers every square inch of the wall. He is a young	man of about eighteen, and though possessing the	intimidating Borg characteristics -- prosthetic arm,	eye, etc. -- he nonetheless exudes the vulnerability of	youth. A portable SENSOR device is visible in the	cell. As he encounters the force field, he reacts,	stepping back and proceeding with his careful	exploration of the walls.24   ON THE GROUP	outside the force field: Picard, Geordi, Beverly, and	the security team.					BEVERLY			What's he doing?					PICARD			Trying to find an access terminal,			so he can interface with the			collective. He doesn't understand			that the signal has been cut off.       STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT TWO       17.24   CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(reading the sensor)			He's emitting a homing signal...			and a second subspace frequency...			but our damping field is blocking			both signals.					PICARD			He's alone. For the first time			in his life he's being forced to			cope with his environment without			the resources of the Collective.	Beverly stares at the boy groping the wall.					BEVERLY			He must be hungry.	They look at her curiously.					BEVERLY			The Borg don't ingest food --			their implants can synthesize any			organic molecules their biological			tissues require. What they need			-- is energy.	She looks right at Picard, a bit challenging. Picard	addresses Geordi.					PICARD			Arrange to feed it.					GEORDI			Aye, sir.	Picard gives the Borg a last look before he EXITS.	Beverly and Geordi watch as the Borg continues his	slow, painstaking groping around the cell, looking for	something familiar.					GEORDI			I'll have to adapt a power conduit			and install it in there.	Beverly doesn't respond, and he looks at her.	Beverly's eyes are fixed on the Borg.          STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - 3/03/92 - ACT TWO          18.24   CONTINUED: (3)					BEVERLY			If I didn't know better... I'd			think he was scared.	Geordi turns and eyes the Borg, who is feeling	carefully, high on the wall, for a link-up with home.25   INT. SHIP'S GYMNASIUM	Two figures are fencing. It soon becomes clear that	one of them is less adept than the other. He or she is	forced to retreat just to stay in the match -- but	retreat only delays the inevitable. The better fencer	lunges and makes a touch.	The two remove their masks and we realize that Picard	is the better fencer; his opponent -- is GUINAN.					GUINAN			I don't think I like this sport.					PICARD			Last week when you scored two			touches on me, you liked it well			enough.	They start walking toward the side of the room, where	"gym bags" lie on a bench.					PICARD			Today your foil was dipping too			low... you kept letting me inside.					GUINAN			And if I hold it too high, you			lunge under it. Let's face it			-- you're just better at this than			I am.	They reach the bench, sit, pull out towels, wipe their	faces, taking a breather between encounters. There is	a silence, somewhat prolonged, as they do what they do,	and when Guinan finally speaks, it is with forced	nonchalance.					GUINAN			I hear we have a guest on board.	Picard shoots her a glance.					PICARD			Yes.          STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - 3/03/92 - ACT TWO          19.25   CONTINUED:	Another silence.					GUINAN			Is that wise?					PICARD			I'm not sure. I hope so.	Another pause as Guinan stuffs things in her bag.	There's a lot going on inside, but she's keeping a lid	on it.					GUINAN			I thought I understood you,			Picard. But I don't understand			this.					PICARD			It was an errand of mercy... he			was injured, Doctor Crusher			decided for humanitarian reasons			to care for him --					GUINAN			They'll be coming, you know that.			You, of all people, know that.	Picard knows she's right. He has no answers. He	changes tacks, rises.					PICARD			Shall we go again?	She nods, and they don their masks and go to center	floor. They advance and retreat a few times, parrying.	Then Guinan lunges... stumbles... grabs at her leg	-- she's pulled a muscle.	Picard drops his foil and starts toward her in concern.	Suddenly she is up and on him in a flurry of thrusts,	and actually knocks the foil from his hand.

Would			you like something to drink?					GUINAN			No, thanks.	She wanders the room a bit, picking up an artifact and	setting it down, gazing out the window.         STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR         43.40   CONTINUED:	Picard waits patiently, knowing she'll get to whatever	brought her here in her own time.					GUINAN			I was thinking about how you said			my foil was dipping the other			day... maybe I should do some			exercises... build up a little			strength in my arm...					PICARD			A strong forearm is always an			advantage in fencing...					GUINAN			Not to mention tending bar...	He waits. She goes to a chair, sits.					GUINAN			About the Borg...	Now it's his turn to be wary. What could she have in	mind about the Borg to bring her here at this hour?					GUINAN			Aren't you just a bit surprised			by him?					PICARD			Surprised...					GUINAN			Yes. Did you know he has a name?	Picard gives her a look -- surprised.					GUINAN			La Forge gave it to him. His			name's Hugh. And he's lonely.	Picard is utterly perplexed, both by what she's saying	and the fact that it's Guinan saying it.					GUINAN			I don't know what made me go see			him. La Forge told me I should,			but I said no.	She shakes her head, perplexed by herself.         STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR         44.40   CONTINUED: (2)					GUINAN			And then... I found myself			standing there, staring at him.			Curiosity, I figured... just			curiosity.	She breaks off, struggling in a way we haven't seen	Guinan struggle before.					GUINAN			Picard... I want to hear you say			that you're sure -- that what			you're doing is right.	Picard exhales. The last thing he wants is another	assault on his decision.					PICARD			If you've come here to persuade			me not to use the invasive			program...					GUINAN			No -- I think I'm asking you to			persuade me.					PICARD			Two days ago, you were so upset			about the Borg even being on the			ship that you tore the foil out			of my hand. Now you're here			questioning whether he should be			treated as an enemy.					GUINAN			I know. But... when you talk to			him... face to face... can you			honestly say you have no doubts?					PICARD				(after a beat)			I haven't talked to him.	Guinan is amazed at this.					GUINAN			Why not?					PICARD			I see no need --       STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT FOUR       45.40   CONTINUED: (3)					GUINAN			If you're going to use this person			--					PICARD			It's a Borg, damn it, not a			person --!					GUINAN			If you're going to use this person			to destroy his race, don't you			think you should look him in the			eye once before you do it?				(beat)			Besides... I'm not so sure he is			Borg anymore.					PICARD				(fed up)			Because he's been given a name			by a member of the crew doesn't			mean he's no longer Borg. Because			he's young doesn't mean he's			innocent. He is what he is and			in spite of the efforts to turn			him into some kind of pet -- I			will not alter our plans.	Guinan takes this in, eyes him.					GUINAN			Fine. But unless you talk to him			-- at least once -- you might find			that decision harder to live with			than you realize.	And on that note, they hold a look.41   INT.

Then, the call he's been waiting for.					WORF'S COM VOICE			Worf to Captain Picard...         STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR         46.41   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Yes, Lieutenant.					WORF'S COM VOICE			We are ready to transport.					PICARD			Proceed.	Worf and the Borg MATERIALIZE in the ready room.	Picard stares at the Borg.					PICARD			You may wait outside, Lieutenant.	Worf looks from the Borg to Picard -- he doesn't like	it, but he EXITS. Picard and Hugh regard each other.	Neither says anything for a moment; Hugh seems	bewildered by a dawning recognition.					BORG			Locutus...	Picard realizes that Hugh recognizes him... this	presents an opportunity. He looks directly at the	Borg.					PICARD			Yes. I am Locutus... of Borg.	Confused, Hugh accesses his database -- but there is	nothing there for him.					BORG			Why are you here?					PICARD			This is a primitive culture. I			am here to facilitate its			incorporation. Identify yourself.					BORG			Hugh.					PICARD			Identify yourself.					BORG			We are Hugh.					PICARD			This is not a Borg identification.         STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR         47.41   CONTINUED: (2)	Hugh hesitates, as though trying to reassess himself.					BORG			Third... of five.					PICARD			This culture will be assimilated.	Another hesitation.					BORG			They... do not wish it.					PICARD			Irrelevant.					BORG			They will resist us.					PICARD			Resistance is futile.					BORG			Resistance... is not futile.	Picard glares sternly at him.

Geordi be assimilated?	Picard looks at him, amazed.					PICARD			Yes.	Hugh hesitates... his thought processes are new,	strange, uncomfortable.         STAR TREK: "I, Borg" - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR         48.41   CONTINUED: (3)					BORG			Geordi does not wish it.				(trying to explain)			He would rather die than be			assimilated.					PICARD			Then he will die.	Hugh looks up at him, clearly disturbed.					BORG			No. Geordi must not die.	Hugh takes a breath, looks straight at Picard.					BORG			Geordi is... a friend.	Picard is taken aback by this, but wants to push it a	bit further.					PICARD			You will assist us in assimilating			this vessel.	Hugh hesitates.					PICARD			You are Borg. You will assist			us.	Hugh takes a breath... then...					BORG			I will not.	Picard stares at him... hears him say the word "I."

I think I deliberately avoided			speaking with the Borg because			I didn't want anything to get in			the way of our plan.				(beat)			But now something has. As far			as I can tell, he seems to be a			fully realized individual. He			has even accepted me as Picard,			Captain of this ship, and not as			Locutus.	There are varying reactions to this... Geordi and	Beverly on the positive side, Worf and Riker somewhat	concerned.					GEORDI			Then... you've reconsidered the			plan?					PICARD			Yes.
