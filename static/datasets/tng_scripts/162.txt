After all, what if you were			suddenly to decide to leave this			star system... ?					PICARD			You have my word as an officer			of Starfleet that I will not.					KRAG			Unacceptable. You must turn him			over to me for interrogation.					PICARD			Interrogate him here.					KRAG			Captain, we must recreate			step-by-step, moment-by-moment,			the events leading to the			explosion... we need immediate			access to all the witnesses, as			well as the data from the lab's			ground computers.
