ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR	Later. Worf and RIKER are walking along, midconversation.	Worf is carrying his Bat'leth sword and	trophy. He keeps looking around, nervous -- he seems	preoccupied by something.					RIKER			It looks like we're going to have			to head out to the Argus Array.			This is the third time in the last			year it's stopped relaying data.			Starfleet's beginning to think it			may be more than a simple			malfunction.	As they turn a corner, Worf hesitates, as though	expecting an attack.					RIKER				(continuing)			I want you to start a long range			scan as soon as we enter the --	Riker takes note of Worf's jumpiness.					RIKER			Are you listening to me,			Lieutenant?					WORF			Oh... yes, sir.					RIKER			You seem pretty tense for a man			who just came back from vacation.	They stop at Worf's quarters. Worf very cautiously	touches a control by the door...					WORF			Today... is my birthday.	Suddenly, Worf opens the door and bursts into the room --4    INT. WORF'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS	Worf rushes in, looks around, ready for anything. No	one's there. He seems relieved. Riker looks at him a	bit oddly.					RIKER			What's the matter with you?         STAR TREK: "Parallels" - 10/07/93 - TEASER         3.4    CONTINUED:					WORF			Because it is my birthday... I			assumed that you or one of the			others would try to mount an			unexpected... social gathering.					RIKER			You mean a surprise party? Worf,			I hate surprise parties. I would			never do that to you.					WORF			I am... sorry, Commander.					RIKER			Why don't you settle in and I'll			meet you on the Bridge.					WORF			Aye sir.	Riker EXITS. Worf takes a breath, relaxing... he sets	down his Bat'leth and sets his trophy proudly on a	table. He heads for the bedroom, starts to take off	his sash, gets about half-way there when suddenly --					VOICES			SURPRISE!!	Worf LEAPS back, as if scalded --5    REVEAL (OPTICAL)	TROI, BEVERLY, GEORDI, DATA and SEVERAL N.D.S as they	rush out of the bedroom. Many hold birthday GIFTS --	others have party favors, noise-makers. It's the most	human and obnoxious party you can imagine. They come	up shaking his hand, offering birthday wishes, patting	him on the back. Troi and Beverly kiss him on the	cheek. Riker ENTERS during the middle of all this,	comes up behind Worf with huge smile on his face.					RIKER			Actually, Worf, I love surprise			parties.	Riker then puts a big, ridiculous PARTY HAT on Worf's	head.         STAR TREK: "Parallels" - 10/07/93 - TEASER         4.5    CONTINUED:	OFF Worf's reaction...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   STAR TREK: "Parallels" - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE         5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            6    INT. WORF'S QUARTERS	A few minutes later. Beverly is holding a large	CHOCOLATE CAKE, which has many burning CANDLES on it.	Everyone is singing the "For He's A Jolly Good Fellow",	but with Klingon lyrics. Worf stands there awkwardly --	this is like torture for him.					ALL				(sung to the tune of				 "For He's A Jolly Good				 Fellow")			"Cha Worf Toh'gah-nah lo			Pre'tOk... Cha Worf Toh'gah-nah			lo Pre'tOk... Cha Worf Toh'gah-nah			lo Pre'tO-O-O-O-Ok... Tu Mak			Dagh Cha doh Borak!"	As they finish the song, Beverly holds out the cake to	Worf, who quickly blows out the candles. Everyone	applauds. Worf can barely conceal his disgust.					WORF			That was not a Klingon song.					TROI			It wasn't easy to translate.			There doesn't seem to be a Klingon			word for "jolly".	Beverly hands Worf a knife.					BEVERLY			It's traditional for the birthday			boy to cut the cake.	Worf takes the knife and eyes it a moment -- other uses	for it cross his mind. Then he cuts the cake with two	quicks WHACKS and serves a piece to a Crewmember.	(NOTE: The cake is chocolate inside, as well.)         STAR TREK: "Parallels" - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE         6.6    CONTINUED:	The party proceeds merrily, with Beverly moving off to	cut the rest of the cake, people getting drinks, etc.	Riker claps a friendly hand on Worf's shoulder.					RIKER			Captain Picard sends his birthday			wishes. He was needed on the			Bridge.	Riker moves off to get some cake. Data walks over	holding a large GIFT. He hands it to Worf.					DATA			Happy birthday, Worf.	Worf takes the gift.					WORF			Thank you....	Worf tears the wrapping paper off the gift, revealing	a large PAINTING -- a great deal of conflicting colors	and shapes. It is difficult to tell which side is up.	Worf eyes it...					WORF			Ah... a painting.					DATA			Yes. I have entered my Abstract			Expressionistic phase. This is my			interpretation of the Battle of			HarOS.	Worf examines the painting, hunting for any	recognizable image.					WORF			The Battle of HarOS... ?	Troi takes the painting.         STAR TREK: "Parallels" - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE         7.6    CONTINUED: (2)					TROI			I think it's wonderful. And I			know just where to hang it...	She moves to a spot on the wall.					WORF			What are you doing?					TROI			I always thought this room could			use a little more color.	Troi hangs the painting and steps back. Geordi comes	over to admire the painting, carrying two pieces of	cake.					GEORDI				(re: painting)			Battle of HarOS, right?	Worf looks at him in amazement. Geordi hands a piece	of cake to Worf. The interior of the cake is now	YELLOW, not chocolate as seen before. (NOTE: Minor	continuity changes of this sort will be indicated	throughout the script.)	As Worf takes the cake, he reacts to a mild wave of	dizziness.					GEORDI			You alright?					WORF			I believe Commander Data's			painting is making me dizzy...	Laughter all around. Worf takes a bite of his cake,	looks down at it.					WORF				(casual)			I thought this cake was			chocolate...					TROI			Don't I wish.	Troi hands Worf a small GIFT. (NOTE: Troi is dressed	in one of her casual outfits, and her hair is in a	looser, more casual style.)         STAR TREK: "Parallels" - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE         8.6    CONTINUED: (3)					TROI				(re: gift)			This is from Alexander. He gave			it to me before he left to visit			your parents.	Worf sets down the cake and takes the gift... carefully	unwraps it. We see that it is a round piece of CLAY,	with the imprint of Alexander's forehead ridges on it	(the Klingon equivalent of a child's hand-print). Worf	smiles at the sight.					GEORDI			What is it?					WORF			Alexander's forehead.				(proudly)			The ridges of a warrior.					TROI			He really wished he could've been			here when you got back from shore			leave. You should have seen him,			Worf... he stayed up all night			talking about how proud he was of			his father.					WORF			Thank you for watching him while			I was away.					TROI			It was my pleasure.	Worf looks at her, and he gets a thoughtful look on is	face... clearly concerned about something...	Suddenly, we hear PICARD'S voice from offcamera --					PICARD			So... how old are you, Mister			Worf?	Worf turns in surprise.7    REVEAL PICARD	standing behind Worf.

Worf eyes the door	warily -- he knows what's coming.					RIKER			Something wrong?					WORF			I know what you are planning.				(off his look)			I will not be surprised.					RIKER			Surprised? I don't know what			you're talking about.					WORF				(wry)			Of course you don't.	Riker looks at him, puzzled. Worf touches a control	and the doors open...67   INT. WORF'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS	Worf ENTERS and glances around. No one's there. He	sets down his trophy and sword and heads to the	bedroom... pauses by the door expectantly, then bursts	into the room --            STAR TREK: "Parallels" - 10/07/93 - ACT FIVE            65.68   NEW ANGLE - BEDROOM	The room is empty except for Troi, who is standing by	a small terrarium. She looks up, a little startled.					TROI			Worf... welcome home.	She smiles. Worf eyes her with concern -- and for a	terrible moment it looks like they might still be	married. Troi indicates the terrarium.					TROI			I hope you don't mind I let myself			in. I promised Alexander I'd feed			his Dalvin hissing beetle while			you were both away.					WORF			So... you do not live here?	She looks at him in surprise.					TROI			What is that supposed to mean?					WORF			It is a... long story.	She hands him a small GIFT.					TROI			Happy birthday.				(beat)			Wil wanted to give you a surprise			party, but I knew you'd hate it...			so I talked him out of it.					WORF			Thank you.	There's an awkward beat.					TROI			Well... I know Klingons like to be			alone on their birthdays.				(with humor)			I'm sure you have to meditate, or			hit yourself with a pain stick or			something.            STAR TREK: "Parallels" - 10/07/93 - ACT FIVE            66.68   CONTINUED:	She turns to go...					WORF			Deanna... you do not have to			leave.					TROI			Oh?					WORF			I have not had dinner. Would you			care to... join me?	Troi is touched, and a little surprised.					TROI			I'd love to.	Worf smiles at her and indicates a chair. Troi sits	down.
