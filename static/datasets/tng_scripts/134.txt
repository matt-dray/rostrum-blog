SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as the Enterprise comes out of warp, slows to the	proper impulse speed.4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	as before.					RIKER			Captain, this is the bridge. We			have arrived at Starbase			one-seven-nine.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Acknowledged, Number One.     STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - TEASER     2.4    CONTINUED:					RIKER				(to Wesley)			Establish position -- zero-nine-zero mark			three-seven-five -- at			twenty-seven thousand			kilometers.					WESLEY			Aye, sir.					RIKER			Open hailing frequencies,			Lieutenant.					WORF			Hailing frequencies open.					RIKER			Starbase one-seven-nine, this is			the USS Enterprise.					STARBASE COM VOICE			Enterprise, this is Starbase			one-seven-nine.

Ensign Crusher, you will			accompany me.	As Riker and Wesley exit, Data takes the Command	position.5    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as the Enterprise establishes its position near the	starbase. The starbase is located on a misty, shrouded	planet.6    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Data has the Command Chair.     STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - TEASER     3.6    CONTINUED:					DATA			Starbase one-seven-nine. We are			ready to commence transfer.					STARBASE COM VOICE			Acknowledge Enterprise. Begin			transfer.7    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	FIVE MEMBERS of the Enterprise crew (three men, two	women) stand on the transporter pads. Riker and the	TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN at the control panel.	Wesley is off to one side. Riker eyes them with a	warmth and with a sense of humor.					RIKER			This is my last chance to say that			it has been a pleasure to serve			with you and to wish you luck on			your new assignment. You have			served the Enterprise well.				(slight smile)			No tears, please.	Before the members on the pad can cover their smiles to	answer:					RIKER				(continuing)			Energize.	The five crewmembers DEMATERIALIZE. Wesley and Riker	laugh.	Transporter Chief O'Brien responds to a signal on the	panel, announces in response.					CHIEF O'BRIEN			Enterprise ready. Beam aboard.8    ON PADS (OPTICAL)	FOUR REPLACEMENTS MATERIALIZE on the pads, among them	is ENSIGN MENDON, a large, blue-skinned officer from	the planet Benzar. He breathes through a special	device at his chest which converts the oxygen level to	his use. He is young, alert, quick moving and as the	nature of Benzites, he is always ready to please and	demonstrate his abilities.     STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - TEASER     4.9    SCENE	The new members step off the pad and file through the	doorway with nods and smiles. Wesley spots Mendon and	reacts.					RIKER			Welcome aboard the Enterprise.			I'm Commander William Riker, your			first officer. Those of you who			are here as replacements will step			outside and Lieutenant Lewis will			assign you to crew quarters.				(to Mendon)			Ensign, you are here on the			exchange program, you'll follow			Mister Crusher.	Wesley steps forward anxiously. He addresses Mendon in	a friendly manner.					WESLEY			Mordoc, what are you doing here?			You couldn't have graduated from			the Academy already.	Mendon eyes Wesley oddly.					MENDON			I am not Mordoc. I am Mendon.			Ensign Mendon of the planet			Benzar.10   ON WESLEY	He is slightly flustered, embarrassed. He explains:					WESLEY			I'm sorry sir. I thought you were			a friend... Mordoc...				(beat)			... You look just like him.					MENDON			We are from the same			geostructure. Naturally we look			alike.					WESLEY			How do you tell each other apart?					MENDON			We just do.     STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - TEASER     5.11   SCENE	Riker steps in to save Wesley any further	embarrassment.					RIKER			Well, nice to have you here			Ensign. There will be a			briefing and indoctrination			session as soon as you settle in.12   SCENE	Mendon stops next to Riker to announce.					MENDON			I want to tell you how happy I			am to be assigned to the			Enterprise. It wasn't just luck.			I requested it. I know I can			be of great help to the ship.					RIKER				(surprised)			Yes, of course. Now if you'll			just follow Ensign Crusher.					MENDON			Yes sir.	As Mendon exits the room Riker gives a quick "God save	us" glance to Transporter Chief O'Brien. Picard's	com voice is heard.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Commander Riker, report to the			Phaser Range, please...	Riker touches his communicator.					RIKER			On the way.	Riker exits the room.12A  EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in position near the starbase.     STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - TEASER     6.13   INT. PHASER RANGE - CLOSE ON TARGET (OPTICAL)	as it is zapped by a phaser beam and flashes a burst of	light and a change of color. Then another one next to	it. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Riker and Picard at	the firing station, almost back to back and firing at	light targets that appear in an arc around them.	Picard fires off two blasts of his own phaser. The	targets are HIT.					PICARD			I was wondering if you had any			feelings about the Officer			Exchange Program that has been			initiated by Starfleet Command.					RIKER			Just positive ones sir. I've			already welcomed Ensign Mendon			on board and he certainly seems			eager to please.					PICARD			That's a Benzite trait.				(beat)			It's been suggested that one of			the officers on the Enterprise			might like to participate in this			exchange program.					RIKER			Probably a good idea.	Picard takes a moment to fire off three quick blasts	and then to remark offhandedly.					PICARD			There's a Klingon vessel in the			vicinity.	Riker covers any reaction by firing his own phaser at	the target. Both men continue to fire in order, both	of them covering any reaction and attempting to act	nonchalant about this assignment					RIKER			I don't recall ever hearing of			a Federation officer serving on			a Klingon vessel.					PICARD			Neither have I.     STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - TEASER     7.13   CONTINUED:					RIKER			It could be beneficial.					PICARD			Having Worf on board certainly			has been.					RIKER			Yes sir, that's true.				(a shot)			Who did you intend to send?					PICARD			I was going to ask for a			volunteer.	As Picard fires his phaser:					RIKER			I wouldn't mind, sir.					PICARD			What was that, Number One?	Picard covers his smile. Riker spots it, knows he's	been played with.					RIKER			I said I wouldn't mind the			assignment.					PICARD			Any particular reason?					RIKER				(broad grin)			Because nobody has ever done it			before.	Riker opens up with a series of three blasts at the	target which light it up like a Christmas tree.					PICARD			I'll notify starbase of your			acceptance... They'll contact the			Klingon vessel and make the			arrangements.     STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - TEASER     8.13   CONTINUED: (2)	Picard fires at his target, hits it, turns to Riker to	smile, then walks away.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE     9.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:14   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it continues its solo, steady and effortless	impulse flight.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 42606.5.			I have informed the staff of			Commander Riker's temporary duty			assignment and we have departed			from Starbase one-seven-nine and			are headed for a rendezvous with			the Klingon vessel, the Pagh.15   INT. CORRIDOR	Worf and Riker walk and talk. Worf is more animated	than usual as he speaks of the Klingon ship and his	heritage with a certain pride.					WORF			I have studied and know everything			about my heritage.					RIKER			Then you are the one to fill me			in on something that I'm not			clear about.				(beat)			It's my understanding that one			of the duties of the first officer			on a Klingon ship is to			assassinate the captain.					WORF			Yes sir.					RIKER				(reacts)			Wouldn't that bring about chaos?    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE    10.15   CONTINUED:					WORF			Of course not. When and if the			captain becomes weak and unable			to perform, it is expected that			his honorable retirement should			be assisted by his "first."				(beat)			The second officer would			assassinate you for the same			reasons.					RIKER				(beat)			This method of attrition could			take a little getting used to.					WORF			The Klingon system has operated			successfully for centuries.					RIKER			It is different.16   CLOSE ON WORF	He looks at Riker, nods solemnly.					WORF			Many things will be different.17   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Wesley at his Forward Station of Conn. Data is in	Command. All other stations are covered by n.d.	crewmembers except for Science One, which is manned	by Ensign Mendon.	Ensign Mendon steps from his station to look over the	shoulder of the crewmember at the Tactical Station. He	watches for a beat, then comments:					MENDON			That's a wonderful method of			maintaining a constant control			factor over defensive shields,			but I'm sure there's a way to			improve response time.	The crewmember turns to give Mendon a look. Mendon	reads it.    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE    11.17   CONTINUED:					MENDON			Oh, sorry, didn't mean to			interrupt you... Just thought I			could be of some help, however			I am correct in what I said.	Mendon continues his studying walk and ends up next	to Wesley at Conn. He peers over Wesley's shoulder	in the same overseeing manner.					MENDON			That is superb designing,			absolutely first rate.	Wesley remains courteous to a ranking officer even if	he has the annoying Benzite trait of aggressiveness	of an over-achiever.					WESLEY			Yes it is. Would you care to			be more specific?					MENDON			The input sampling. It's simple			yet efficient enough. Of course			a minor change of the helm			readout would be much more			helpful in emergency situations.					WESLEY			We've never had any trouble with			it. Have you seen it work?					MENDON			Not in a practical exercise, but			in theory... my theory... it would			be more than a marginal			improvement. I'll have to mention			this to the captain.					WESLEY			You're going to advise Captain			Picard?					MENDON			Captain Picard... I'll have to			discuss these improvements with			him.				(beat)			He is open to some astute			observations, isn't he?    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE    12.17   CONTINUED: (2)					WESLEY			Well, I've never heard Captain			Picard refuse to listen to his			officers.					MENDON			Outstanding! Pretty soon we'll			get things running perfectly.	Mendon walks away. Wesley's look follows him.18   INT. TEN-FORWARD LOUNGE	Riker sits at a table surrounded by an assortment of	dishes. Each one is a little more disgusting than the	other. If they are edible it is the surprise of the	space age. Riker grimaces as he tests each one in	order. Pulaski steps over to look down on his feast.	She reaches over to lift something ugly.					PULASKI			What is this?					RIKER			A Klingon delicacy. That's heart			of targ -- this is pipius claw.			And this is stewed "gagh."					PULASKI			"Gagh"?					RIKER			Serpent worms... would you like			to know how they're prepared?	Pulaski sits down at the table. A waiter arrives with	about six different drinks. Riker moves some plates	around to make room.					PULASKI			No thanks. I've never heard of			a Klingon starving to death on			one of their own vessels, but you			might.					RIKER			Not if I weaken first.    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE    13.18   CONTINUED:					PULASKI			I know all about that. Their			beliefs may be somewhat brutal			but usually what kills us, kills			them.					RIKER				(sniffing an awful				 drink)			That's something to look forward			to. Would you like a drink,			Doctor?					PULASKI			I'm abstaining in honor of your			last hour on board.					RIKER				(mock serious)			Your sacrifice will not go			unnoticed.	Picard approaches the table from the turbolift.19   NEW ANGLE	as Picard looks down at the table full of food and	covers his reaction. Riker is about to get to his	feet. Picard puts a restraining hand on his shoulder.					PICARD			I understand the theory of the			feast before the transfer. I've			done the same thing dozens of			times. However, I usually made			more civil choices.	Pulaski covers her grin. A tray of desserts arrives	and Pulaski starts to arrange them in whatever space is	left.					RIKER			These are the most civil choices.					PICARD			I see... Well, their food may be			somewhat backward but the Klingons			are efficient, loyal to their			beliefs, and are regulated by a			strict code of ethics.    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE    14.19   CONTINUED:					PULASKI			True enough. They tend to lean			towards a Samurai civilization			that is thousands of years old.					PICARD			But they are pure in that			tradition.	Picard turns back to Riker.					PICARD			This is a great opportunity,			Number One. We really know so			little about them. We have so			much to learn.				(beat, smile)			I think I envy you, Will Riker.	Riker eyes him, nods, almost takes another bite of	food accidentally, then drops it as he becomes	aware...20   INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE TRANSPORTER ROOM	Riker moves down the corridor towards the Transporter	Room. Worf approaches him. He carefully hands Riker a	small electronic device about the size of a Bic	lighter. Riker studies it.					RIKER			An emergency transponder?					WORF			Slightly altered to transmit an			omnidirectional signal and an			emergency call.					RIKER				(examining)			Are you sensing some trouble			that I don't?					WORF				(embarrassed)			Simply a security precaution.			I want to insure your return to			this ship.    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE    15.20   CONTINUED:					RIKER				(surprise)			Sentiment, Lieutenant Worf?					WORF			Efficiency, Commander.					RIKER				(smile)			I understand. Thank you,			Lieutenant.	He tucks the transponder into his boot and walks away.21   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Wesley and an n.d. crewmember at the Forward Stations,	the Aft Stations are covered by n.d. crewmembers.	Science One is covered by Ensign Mendon, Worf	stationed at Tactical. Picard and Data in the Command	Area.					WORF			We have a Klingon vessel			approaching.					PICARD			Hailing frequencies open.					WORF			They are returning our hail in			proper language. It is the Pagh.					PICARD			On viewscreen.22   MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	We see the Klingon vessel on viewscreen. Then the	fierce and unmerciful face of CAPTAIN KARGAN fills the	viewscreen.					PICARD			I am Jean-Luc Picard, captain of			the Enterprise.					KARGAN			And I am Captain Kargan of the			Pagh. Beam your first officer			on board immediately.    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE    16.22   CONTINUED:					PICARD			We are preparing to do so.			You're getting a good man,			Captain Kargan.					KARGAN			Thank you for your opinion but			I will judge that for myself.			Screen off.	The viewscreen goes blank. Mendon comments to Worf.					MENDON			Not very hospitable are they?	Worf responds to him immediately.					WORF			That is not your concern. Observe			your station, Ensign Mendon.					MENDON				(realizing)			Didn't mean to offend you.					WORF			You didn't...				(beat)			... Yet.22A  ANGLE ON SCIENCE SCREEN	Mendon turns back to his screen, adjusts a knob so that	the schematic on screen starts to turn. It is a	skeleton version of the Klingon vessel. Various	technical information scrolls across the screen below	the blueprint.	Then the faint glimmer of a red smear appears on the	hull of the ship.23   CLOSER ON SCREEN	Mendon magnifies the screen and brings the red smear	to the forefront. Then he punches in an informational	request DIRECT SENSOR BEAM. The screen blinks with	SUBSTANCE REQUEST then after a beat answers NOT	DETERMINED. Mendon types in an additional request,	CATEGORY. The scrolled response appears MICROBIOTIC	COLONY... BACTERIAL ANALOG... SUBATOMIC...    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE    17.23   CONTINUED:	Then DIAGNOSIS, the answer TO BE DETERMINED. Mendon's	concentration is interrupted by Captain Picard's	orders.					PICARD			Transporter Room, prepare to beam			Commander Riker aboard the Pagh.	Picard exits.24   OMITTED25   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM	Transporter Chief O'Brien behind the control panel.	Riker is already standing on the pad.

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The Klingon vessel Pagh slowly moving away from the	Enterprise.28   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard eyes the main viewscreen. We see the Pagh	diminishing in size as it puts more distance between	itself and the Enterprise. Data acting as first	officer issues the orders.					DATA			Viewscreen off. Resume course.					WESLEY			Aye sir.	The viewscreen returns to its original pattern.					PICARD			Take over Commander Data, I'll			be in my quarters.					DATA			Yes sir.	Picard moves away from his Command position. He passes	the Science One station, nods to Mendon who seizes this	opportunity to attempt to ingratiate himself to his	new commander, much to the annoyance of Worf.					MENDON			Sir, I'm Ensign Mendon. I just			wanted to tell you how pleased			I am to be aboard the Enterprise.					PICARD				(distracted)			Yes, of course. Nice to have you			on board.	Picard continues on the move.

Riker realizes he	has no choice. He deftly, with no advance warning or	aggressive motion, swings a two-handed blow with his	full strength and lands a monstrous blow across the	chest of Klag.33C  SERIES OF CUTS	The sound of the blow against Klag's chest armor echoes	through the bridge and is followed by the roar of his	breath leaving his body, and then his bulk smashing	against the bulkhead and slipping to the ground.	Riker calmly steps around the still-seated captain and	steps in front of Klag who is struggling to his feet.	Klag is almost to his feet when Riker swings again,	this time taking the legs out from under Klag who drops	to the ground again.	The crewmembers are animated and watch the fight with	relish, not caring who wins or loses but that there is	combat.	Riker looks over to the captain.	Captain Kargan simply sits back and allows it to	continue.	Riker turns back to the dazed but still active Klag who	is once more attempting to get to his feet.	Riker eyes the combatant with a calculated but	astonished eye. Klag can barely stand but bravely	fights for balance. Riker shrugs, and rams his fist	into Klag's stomach, then drops him with another	double-handed blow over the head.    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT TWO    24.33D  SCENE	Kargan applauds with a grunt and a motion of his head.	Klag is awake but prone.

Klag gives	Riker as much a look of respect as he is able...33E  ON RIKER					RIKER			My oath is between Captain Kargan			and myself. Your only concern			is how to obey my orders.				(beat)			Or do you prefer the rank of			prisoner over that of lieutenant?	Klag calculates Riker carefully, then:					KLAG			I will take your orders.	Riker nods his acceptance. Klag returns it.

I also swore a loyalty			to your ship and I will keep that.					KARGAN				(yelling back)			They are in conflict!					RIKER			No sir, they are not! I will obey			your orders. I will serve this			ship as first officer, and in an			attack against the Enterprise I			will die along with this crew...			but I will not dishonor my oath			to the Enterprise.	Riker glares at Kargan who holds his stare a beat, then	nods in agreement.    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT FOUR    44.71   CONTINUED:					KARGAN			If you had agreed to disclose			those facts about the Enterprise			I would have labelled you a			traitor and killed you on the			spot...				(beat)			Instead you will die with us.			You will die like a Klingon.	On Riker -- he nods his acceptance of his fate.					RIKER			So be it.72   EXT.

He is ill at	ease but trying to maintain what he thinks is the	proper protocol.					MENDON			Sir, I have something to report			to you immediately.	Worf seems like he's about to reach over the railings	and snatch Mendon by the skull. Picard restrains his	actions with a glance.					PICARD			Go ahead, Ensign.					MENDON			I have managed to isolate the			organism on our hull.					PICARD			Spare me the technical details...			just the results.    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Honor" - 12/02/88 - ACT FOUR    45.74   CONTINUED:					MENDON			They are of a sub-micron form.			They are controllable and can			be removed from the hulls of both			ships.					PICARD				(relieved, but covers)			Thank you Ensign, well done.			Prepare whatever procedures are			necessary.				(to Worf)			Lieutenant Worf, add this			information to hailing messages.					WORF			Aye sir.
