	The ship moving at impulse power.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's Log: Stardate 44246.3
			We are investigating radiation
			anomalies reported in the Gamma
			Arigulon system by the starship
			LaSalle. Preliminary readings
			are inconclusive.

2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WESLEY, and WORF at their
	stations.

					RIKER
			Mister Data?

					DATA
			No change, Commander. I can
			detect no abnormalities in the
			star's radiant energy.

					PICARD
			Prepare two class one probes.

	Data presses a few panels.

					DATA
			Probes ready, sir.

					PICARD
			Initiate launch sequence.

	Data begins to work his console.

2    CONTINUED:

					WORF
				(reads console)
			Captain... Klingon attack cruiser
			decloaking, bearing zero-one-zero
			mark three-two-seven.

					PICARD
			Belay that order, Mister Data.

					RIKER
			Did Starfleet mention any Klingon
			ships in this sector?

	Picard shakes his head.

					PICARD
			On screen.

5    ON VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	The attack cruiser (bigger than a bird-of-prey)
	DECLOAKS.

6    RETURN TO SCENE

					WORF
			We are being hailed.

					RIKER
			All stop, Mister Crusher.

					WESLEY
			Aye, sir. All stop.

					PICARD
			Open channel.

         STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/5/90 - TEASER         3.

7    ON VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	K'EHLEYR, the striking half-human, half-Klingon woman
	appears on the screen. She wears an attractive tunic
	and is standing in front of a Klingon bulkhead. She
	is here on important business and it shows on her
	face.

					K'EHLEYR
			Hello, Captain Picard.

8    ON WORF

	He is pleasantly surprised at the sight of K'Ehleyr...
	but then he seems to remember something disturbing, and
	he pulls himself back into his customary Klingon stoic
	pose.

9    NEW ANGLE - INTERCUT AS NEEDED (OPTICAL)

					PICARD
				(surprised)
			Ambassador K'Ehleyr... This is
			an unexpected pleasure.

					K'EHLEYR
			It's good to see you again,
			Captain.
				(beat)
			Lieutenant Worf.

	It is said with a pleasant affection and a past
	relationship is obvious. Worf is uncomfortable, but
	manages a slight nod of acknowledgement.

					PICARD
			How may we be of assistance,
			Ambassador?

					K'EHLEYR
			There is an urgent matter we must
			discuss, Captain. Permission to
			come aboard?

					PICARD
			Granted.

	The viewer returns to a shot of the cruiser. Picard
	turns to Worf.

         STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/5/90 - TEASER         4.

9    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Lieutenant, please receive our
			guest.

					WORF
			Captain... I must request
			permission to... send another
			officer.

	Picard is a little surprised.

					PICARD
			May I ask your reason?

					WORF
			My... dishonor among Klingons...
			may offend Ambassador K'Ehleyr.

	Picard frowns...

					PICARD
				(firm)
			You are a member of this crew,
			Lieutenant... and I will not have
			you go into hiding whenever a
			Klingon ship uncloaks.

					WORF
			I withdraw the request, sir.

	Picard nods and Worf EXITS.

									CUT TO:

10   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

	TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN behind the console. Worf
	ENTERS.

					TECHNICIAN
			I just received coordinates, sir.
			Ready to transport two from the
			Klingon vessel.

					WORF
			Two?

					TECHNICIAN
			Yes, sir.

	Worf isn't sure what to make of that.

           STAR TREK: "Reunion" - 9/4/90 - TEASER           5.

10   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			Energize.

	Worf tries to prepare himself. He is inwardly excited
	at the prospect of seeing this woman from his past, but
	holds himself tightly in check. The tech works the
	console.

11   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	K'Ehleyr and a Klingon boy (ALEXANDER) MATERIALIZE.
	(The boy should look about five human years old).
	K'Ehleyr smiles, glancing from the boy to Worf. On
	Worf's stunned reaction...

									FADE OUT.

13A  INT. DAY CARE CENTER

	(As seen in "The Offspring") Worf is standing in the
	outer office watching K'Ehleyr and Alexander through
	the glass. K'Ehleyr is saying goodbye to Alexander
	in the classroom area. There are SEVERAL CHILDREN
	playing in the b.g. K'Ehleyr ENTERS the outer office.

					K'EHLEYR
				(a little concerned)
			I hope he'll be all right.
			Alexander hasn't had much contact
			with other children.

	Worf looks at her for a beat... glances back at
	Alexander... decides not to respond and moves toward
	the Corridor door. K'Ehleyr follows.

14   OMITTED

14A  INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS

	As they ENTER.

					WORF
			Bridge.

	The turbolift MOVES. Worf is staring straight ahead,
	avoiding K'Ehleyr's gaze. She studies him, waiting for
	some kind of response. After a long beat, she grins
	sardonically.

					K'EHLEYR
			Not even a bite on the cheek for
			old time's sake?

	Worf doesn't see the humor in this, as usual.

					WORF
			Perhaps you are not aware of my
			dishonor. I have accepted...
			discommendation.

        STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE        6A.

14A  CONTINUED:

					K'EHLEYR
			I've heard. So now what? I have
			to perform some ridiculous ritual
			to talk to you?

	Worf turns on her, rage boils to the surface. This
	is not a matter he takes lightly.

					WORF
			You may not respect our
			traditions... I do!

	Beat.

					K'EHLEYR
				(unabashed)
			Sorry. I just thought you might
			want to talk.
				(beat)
			A few minutes ago, you looked like
			someone with a question to ask.

					WORF
			Must I ask the question?

					K'EHLEYR
			Yes. You must.

	Worf looks at her... almost says something... then the
	mask closes over his face once more. The doors OPEN.
	Worf takes a step to leave, but K'Ehleyr stops him and
	tries once more to reach him.

					K'EHLEYR
				(continuing)
			What should I tell Alexander...
			that he has no father?

	Now it's been said aloud. A beat before Worf forces
	himself to EXIT. K'Ehleyr is disappointed... but she
	follows him.

									CUT TO:

14B  INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (FORMERLY SCENE 12)

	Picard, Riker, Data, TROI, and Worf listening to
	K'Ehleyr.

        STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE        7.

14B  CONTINUED:

					K'EHLEYR
			The Klingon Empire is at a
			critical juncture. We may be
			facing civil war.

	Reactions around the table.

					RIKER
			War over what?

					K'EHLEYR
			The usual excuses... tradition...
			duty...
				(with glance at Worf)
			honor...

					DATA
			The word "excuses" implies that
			there are ulterior motives for
			a conflict.

					K'EHLEYR
			I won't bore you with the
			intricacies of Klingon politics.
			Basically, two factions are
			trying to seize power.

					PICARD
			Do you believe there is a threat
			to the Federation in this...
			struggle?

					K'EHLEYR
			Klingon wars seldom remain
			confined to the Empire. Sooner
			or later they'll drag in the
			neighboring star systems, then
			the Tholians, the Ferengi... the
			Federation won't be able to stay
			out of it for long.
				(beat)
			This has been coming for some
			time. Only K'mpec, the head of
			the council, has been able to
			maintain the peace.

					TROI
			Now something has changed that.

        STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE        8.

14B  CONTINUED: (2)

					K'EHLEYR
			Correct.
				(beat)
			K'mpec is dying.

	Picard's frown deepens. He leans forward.

					K'EHLEYR
			He is aboard the cruiser. He has
			come specifically to meet with
			you, Captain. Alone.

	On Picard's reaction...

16   EXT. SPACE - KLINGON CRUISER (OPTICAL)

	The ship hangs in space.

17   INT. K'MPEC'S QUARTERS

	A large cabin intended to house visiting admirals or
	dignitaries. There are a few nasty-looking weapons in
	plain view along with decorative banners and emblems of
	the Empire, denoting its current occupant's rank as head
	of the High Council. There are several chairs and
	tables. A flagon of wine sits on one table. A single
	set of doors is visible. The doors OPEN and Picard
	is escorted in by a Klingon sentry.

18   NEW ANGLE

	K'MPEC moves out of a dark corner and steps into the
	light. He looks older, more frail than when we saw him
	before. His cloak hangs on him like the shawl of an
	old man rather than the cape of a warrior, but there is
	still a vestige of steel left in his eyes.

					K'MPEC
			It's about time you arrived,
			Picard. Didn't she tell you I
			was dying?

	He waves out the sentry. K'mpec is easily winded and
	he sits.

					PICARD
			I heard you were ill.

					K'MPEC
				(matter-of-fact)
			I'm not ill, I'm dying. Sit.

	Picard sits. K'mpec's bravado disappears.

					K'MPEC
				(continuing)
			I need your help.

					PICARD
			If the Enterprise medical
			facility...

        STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE        10.

18   CONTINUED:

					K'MPEC
			Too late. For months I've been
			poisoned with small doses of
			Veridium Six.
				(indicating wine)
			The wine. There is no cure.

	K'mpec picks up the flagon and drinks a large gulp
	of wine in a contemptuous gesture. He takes a ragged
	breath... winded again. The poison is catching up
	with him. Picard absorbs this... knows that K'mpec
	doesn't want his sympathy.

					PICARD
			What do you want of me?

					K'MPEC
			After I die... you will act in
			my name to arbitrate the struggle
			for power.

	Picard reacts. A beat. Picard, incredulously, studies
	the old leader...

					PICARD
			I will?

					K'MPEC
			No one on the Council can be
			trusted and... I have my reasons
			for wanting an... outsider.

					PICARD
			K'mpec. You can't be serious.
			A Federation officer has no
			business...

					K'MPEC
				(interrupting)
			Nonsense. You are an accomplished
			mediator. This is no different
			than any other dispute requiring
			your services.

					PICARD
			On the contrary, I think it is
			very different. And I must
			respectfully decline.

	K'mpec rises and regains a bit of the fire we've seen
	before...

        STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE        11.

18   CONTINUED: (2)

					K'MPEC
			If you refuse the dying request
			of the Klingon Supreme
			Commander... it will be a
			Federation insult to all Klingons!

	Picard stares at him. Off-handed --

					K'MPEC
			Besides, I've already sent the
			orders to the leaders of the two
			opposing factions. They're on
			their way.

					PICARD
				(angry)
			You had no right to involve me
			without my permission.

					K'MPEC
			If I'd asked, you would have said
			no.

					PICARD
			This is not a case of simple
			mediation... you are asking me
			to choose the next leader of the
			Klingon Empire.

					K'MPEC
			No. By tradition, the two
			strongest challengers fight for
			the right of succession. But as
			mediator only you can designate
			those challengers.

					PICARD
			But you've just said there are
			only two challengers arriving.
			What is the point?

					K'MPEC
			The point, my good Captain Picard,
			is for you to discover which one
			of them has killed me -- Gowron
			or Duras.

	Picard reacts to Duras' name.

					K'MPEC
			Yes -- Duras. I thought you'd
			find that interesting.

        STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT ONE        12.

18   CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD
				(dry)
			Interesting? Yes, I would say
			that, since he conspired to strip
			Worf of his good name and tried
			to have me killed...

					K'MPEC
			And I approved.

	And shrugs, so what? Picard studies him.

					K'MPEC
			All for the good of the Empire.
			That should be my epitaph.

	This takes a great deal out of him. K'mpec leans back
	in his chair, exhausted.

					K'MPEC
			Find the assassin. The Klingon
			who kills without showing his face
			has no honor. He must not lead
			the Empire. Such a man would
			be capable of anything. Even war
			with the Federation.

	Picard is a little moved by the sight of this lion in
	winter. He takes a long beat to think it over...
	makes the decision.

					PICARD
			Very well. I accept.

	There is a trace of relief in K'mpec's face... his
	final task completed.

					K'MPEC
			If there is war... it will not
			end quickly. Millions of
			warriors... hundreds of worlds...
			destruction on a galactic scale...
				(beat)
			Part of me regrets that I'll miss
			it.

	As he drinks deeply from his wine, on Picard's
	reaction...

	Alexander is being taught how to play a game using
	large blocks and balls by three other kids. As he
	tries his hand at the game... but instead of following
	the rules, he just grabs all the blocks to the protest
	of the other kids. They try to stop him... Alexander
	bares his teeth, as if to challenge them all... just
	as Worf's HAND suddenly moves into frame and restrains
	him.

			I would have won!

					WORF
			You must earn victory...

	As Worf leads him out...

24   INT. CORRIDOR

	Worf and Alexander are heading for K'Ehleyr's quarters.
	Alexander is very curious... trying to probe. Worf is
	resistant, doesn't want to establish a connection with
	the boy, but it's difficult to distance himself.

					ALEXANDER
			Where are the other Klingons?

					WORF
			There are no others on board.

					ALEXANDER
			Why?

					WORF
			The Federation and the Klingon
			Empire were enemies for many
			years. No other Klingons have
			asked to serve in Starfleet.

					ALEXANDER
			Why?

	Worf is really getting tired of this.

					WORF
				(firm)
			A warrior does not ask so many
			questions.

					ALEXANDER
				(a little surprised)
			I don't want to be a warrior.

	Worf's eyes flash... this is not what he wants to hear
	from his own son!

25   INT. K'EHLEYR'S QUARTERS

	K'Ehleyr is studying an Okudagram on a terminal. The
	door OPENS and Worf and Alexander ENTER. Alexander
	runs to his mother, gives her a quick hug. She looks
	at Worf with surprise.

					K'EHLEYR
				(to Alexander)
			Hello! You're back early.

					ALEXANDER
			He made me leave.

	K'Ehleyr gives Worf a questioning look.

					K'EHLEYR
			Why don't you go to your room and
			play.

	Alexander EXITS to adjacent bedroom.

					K'EHLEYR
				(sarcastic)
			Is he under arrest?

	Worf doesn't want to play her game of verbal give-and-
	take.

					WORF
				(angry)
			He knows nothing of our ways!

					K'EHLEYR
			Our ways? You mean Klingon ways,
			don't you?

					WORF
			He is Klingon!

					K'EHLEYR
			He is also my son... and I am half-
			human. He will find his own ways.

25   CONTINUED:

					K'EHLEYR (Cont'd)
			Why the sudden concern? You won't
			even acknowledge that he's yours.

	He knows she's right... it deflates some of his anger,
	but not all of it.

        STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT TWO        16.

25   CONTINUED: (2)

					WORF
			Why did you not tell me?

					K'EHLEYR
			And what would you have done?

	Worf looks away, knows where she's going with this.

					K'EHLEYR
				(continuing)
			That's right... you would have
			insisted that we take the oath...
			just as tradition would demand.

					WORF
			You should not have kept this from
			me.

					K'EHLEYR
				(softer)
			Well, now you know.

	A beat of silence. K'Ehleyr moves to Worf... there
	is still a great deal of attraction and passion between
	them. Worf responds to her gentler tone, but this is
	very difficult for him.

					WORF
			I cannot... acknowledge my
			relationship to the boy.

	K'Ehleyr turns away, bitterly disappointed.

					WORF
				(continuing)
			It would only harm him.

					K'EHLEYR
			Because you were dishonored?

					WORF
			As my son, he would also bear my
			disgrace... as would his
			children.

	K'Ehleyr is frustrated... she wants to understand, but
	Worf is still holding out on her.

					K'EHLEYR
			Why did you accept discommendation
			from the High Council?

25   CONTINUED: (3)

	Worf looks away, as if watching the scene from the past
	being replayed all over again.

					WORF
				(quiet)
			My father was accused of
			collaborating with the Romulans
			at Khitomer...

					K'EHLEYR
			I know. And I also know that
			you challenged it...

					WORF
			Yes... at first. Ultimately...
			I withdrew my challenge.

					K'EHLEYR
			But why, Worf? I can't believe
			you'd just give up.

	He forces himself to crush down the feelings of rage
	and betrayal that rise to the surface. K'Ehleyr knows
	that Worf still isn't telling her everything.

					K'EHLEYR
				(continuing)
			What really happened?

	Worf wants to answer... debates with himself for a
	second... but knows that he can't. He heads for the
	door... furious at the situation.

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
			Lieutenant Worf, Ambassador
			K'Ehleyr, report to the Bridge.

	Worf stops, irritated.

					WORF
				(hits communicator)
			On our way, Commander.

	K'Ehleyr moves to him... they share a look that says
	there is still much to discuss...

			Duras must not be allowed to lead

			It is not personal, sir. His

	Picard takes a moment.

					PICARD
			Klingon tradition may blame the

			cannot, Worf. Treason was his

31   INT. K'MPEC'S QUARTERS

	K'mpec's body has been left sitting in his chair.
	There should be no feeling of this being a "wake" in
	the human sense of the word... K'mpec's corpse is
	accorded no reverence. Picard and K'Ehleyr stand at
	the head of the room. K'Ehleyr is holding a
	painstick.

32   NEW ANGLE

	as the doors OPEN. GOWRON and TWO KLINGON RETAINERS
	ENTER. One of the retainers carries a painstik.
	Gowron looks hostile, impatient... not a likely ally
	for Picard. They barely glance at the corpse and move
	to the left of K'mpec's still form.

33   ON PICARD AND K'EHLEYR

					K'EHLEYR
				(quiet)
			That's Gowron.

	Picard looks at K'mpec's dead body.

			It will be just long enough to

34   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	men also carries a painstik. Duras wears a cloak
	showing him to be a member of the Council. Duras and
	Gowron snarl with hate at the sight of each other.
	Their retainers tense and it looks like they might
	fight it out right here... the moment passes and Duras
	moves to the opposite side of the room from Gowron.

	Both parties look expectantly at Picard. K'Ehleyr
	hands the painstik to Picard. He moves forward and
	stands before K'mpec's corpse.

					PICARD
			Qab... jIH... nagil (Face me if

	He places the end of the painstik on K'mpec's chest

34   CONTINUED:

	Picard moves away from this distasteful duty and goes
	back to his position. Gowron immediately moves forward
	and takes his painstik.

					GOWRON
			Qab jIH nagil!

	Gowron plunges the 'stik into K'mpec and relishes the
	moment as the stick BUZZES. He removes the 'stik, and
	Gowron goes back to his place. Duras now takes his
	turn.

					DURAS
			Qab jiH nagil!

	Duras viciously jabs the body of K'mpec, holding the
	'stik in for a long beat. He goes back to his place.

	The ceremony has ended. Duras and Gowron move to

			Possibly. Why should I?

					GOWRON
			Your position is... unique. Have

			As a Federation Ambassador.

			There are many opportunities for

					K'EHLEYR
			Opportunities that will present
			themselves only if you come to

	a computer terminal. The doors OPEN... Worf, carrying
	the bat'telh, and a KLINGON GUARD ENTER. Duras looks
	up, shocked to see Worf.

					DURAS
				(to Guard)
			How could you let him in here?

	A glance between Worf and the Guard.

					GUARD
			He has claimed the right of
			vengeance.

	The retainers step back from Duras and the Guard moves
	to one side. Their attitude is respectful.

					DURAS
			You have no rights here, traitor!

           STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/10/90 - ACT FIVE           48.

60   CONTINUED:

	Worf moves to the center of the room and speaks not
	to Duras, but to the other Klingons.

					WORF
			K'Ehleyr... was my mate.

	Everyone looks at Duras... he's surprised. A long beat
	as it becomes clear that no one is going to stop Worf.
	A retainer brings Duras a long scythe-like weapon with
	a wicked blade. Duras holds it... he and Worf
	exchange a look of challenge.

									CUT TO:

61   INT. CORRIDOR

	Riker, Data, and TWO N.D. SECURITY GUARDS moving
	quickly along the corridor. Riker's expression is
	deadly serious.

					DATA
			And if Lieutenant Worf resists,
			sir?

					RIKER
			He's coming back with us one way
			or another. Set phasers to
			maximum stun.

	They ENTER the Transporter Room.

									CUT TO:

62   INT. DURAS' QUARTERS (KLINGON SHIP)

	A tremendous CLANG of metal as Worf's sword deflects
	Duras' weapon. This isn't as brutish as normal Klingon
	fights... they skillfully manipulate their weapons with
	a sense of grace and balance... two samurai stalking
	and probing the defenses of each other. Worf is
	focused, intent... and there is a feral quality to his
	expression, as if the veneer of civilization has been
	stripped away and only the warrior is left.

           STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/10/90 - ACT FIVE           49.

63   ON WORF AND DURAS

	The combat continues... flashes of metal, snarls of
	fury... the ferocity builds... their weapons become
	tightly locked together... Worf glares into Duras' face
	with hatred.

					DURAS
			I'm the only one, Worf... the only
			one who can prove your innocence.
			Kill me... and you will always
			be known as a traitor.

					WORF
				(without hesitation)
			Then that is how it shall be.

	They break the clinch... (NOTE: the following two
	scenes take place very quickly)

64   NEW ANGLE

	as Riker, Data, and the Security Guards ENTER. They
	stop at the sight of Worf and Duras.

					RIKER
			Worf!

65   ON WORF AND DURAS

	Worf and Duras pay no attention to Riker's arrival.
	(NOTE: and it should not in any way appear that Riker's
	appearance acts as a diversion that affects the outcome
	of the fight.) Worf kicks Duras' legs out from under
	him.

65A  DURAS' FACE

	reacts at the bat'telh is driven deep into his chest...
	he gasps, shudders, then is gone.

66   WIDE ANGLE

	Worf stands over his fallen adversary... the bat'telh
	sticking out of Duras's chest.

66A  RIKER AND DATA
	react.

           STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/10/90 - ACT FIVE          49A.

66B  WORF

	Eyes still filled with rage, stares at Duras.

67   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship hangs in space.

68   INT. READY ROOM

	Worf standing before Picard.

					PICARD
			Lieutenant, you are a fine
			officer... your service aboard
			this ship has been exemplary...
				(beat)
			Until now.

					WORF
			Sir, I acted within the boundaries
			of Klingon law and tradition.

					PICARD
			The High Council seems to agree
			with you. They consider the
			matter to be closed.
				(beat)
			I do not.

	Worf stands a little more stiffly... at attention.

					PICARD
			The Enterprise crew currently
			includes representatives from
			thirteen planets, Mister Worf.
			They each have their individual
			beliefs and values and I respect
			them all. But every member of
			the crew has chosen to serve
			Starfleet. If anyone cannot
			perform his duties because of the
			demands of his society, he must
			resign.

	Picard lets that hang there for a beat.

					PICARD
			Do you wish to resign, Lieutenant?

           STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/10/90 - ACT FIVE          49B.

68   CONTINUED:

					WORF
				(swallows hard)
			Captain...

					PICARD
			I would hope you would not throw
			away a promising career.

					WORF
			No sir.

            STAR TREK: "Reunion" - REV. 9/7/90 - ACT FIVE           50.

68   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
				(softer)
			I understand your pain... we all
			felt very close to K'Ehleyr.
				(long beat)
			A reprimand will be on your
			record. Dismissed.

	Worf turns to leave. Picard thinks for a beat then...

					PICARD
			Worf...

	Worf stops. Picard's attitude is more intimate... more
	personal.

					PICARD
			Isn't it time for the truth about
			your father's innocence to be
			told? After all, the reasons you
			accepted this dishonor were to
			protect the name of Duras, and
			hold the Empire together. Now
			that he's died in disgrace...
			where is the honor in further
			silence?

					WORF
			Each member of the Klingon high
			council shared in that lie. They
			will not be so willing to admit
			their own dishonor.
				(beat)
			But the day will come when my
			brother and I will... "convince"
			them to speak the truth.

	Worf EXITS. On Picard's reaction...

									CUT TO:

69   INT. WORF'S QUARTERS

	Worf is speaking to Alexander on the couch.

              STAR TREK: "Reunion" - 9/4/90 - ACT FIVE              51.

69   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			My parents... my human parents
			will meet us at Starbase
			Seventy-Three. They will care
			for you.

					ALEXANDER
			Why can't I stay with you?

					WORF
			You deserve a home... a family.
			My parents can provide that...
			I cannot.

	Alexander accepts this reluctantly... he looks away.
	Worf knows what's running through this boy's mind.

					WORF
				(gently)
			I miss her too.

	Alexander looks directly into Worf's eyes. A long
	probing stare from the boy before he asks...

					ALEXANDER
			Are you my father?

	Worf struggles for a second... makes the decision.

					WORF
			Yes... I am your father.

	The human part of Alexander needs something more from
	his father. Alexander hesitates... reaches out... puts
	his arms around Worf. After a beat, Worf returns the
	embrace.

70   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship moving off into space.

									FADE OUT.
