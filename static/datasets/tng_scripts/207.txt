ROMULAN CAVES	Spock and Picard face each other as before. Data,	Pardek, Romulan #1, and the other abductor witness the	confrontation... Spock is not pleased to see anyone	from Starfleet. With building conflict --					SPOCK			What are you doing on Romulus?					PICARD			That was to be my question for			you, sir.					SPOCK			It is no concern of Starfleet's.					PICARD			On the contrary, Starfleet is most			concerned. You are in a position			to compromise the security of the			Federation...					SPOCK			You may assure your superiors that			I am on a personal mission, of			peace, and will advise them when			appropriate.					PICARD			That will not be satisfactory.					SPOCK			You cannot remain, Captain.					PICARD			And I cannot return without a full			explanation.				(beat)			Ambassador, with the greatest			respect for all you've achieved			on behalf of the Federation, this			sort of cowboy diplomacy is not			easily tolerated any more...   STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. II - REV. 8/30/91 - TEASER   2.1    CONTINUED:					SPOCK			"Cowboy diplomacy"... ?					PICARD			If you wish to undertake a mission			with potential repercussions to			the Federation, it is appropriate			to discuss it with the Federation.			I am here as their representative.			You will have to discuss it with			me.	Spock frowns with frustration, moves away from	Picard... A thoughtful beat.					SPOCK			This is precisely what I wanted			to avoid.	A beat. Picard moves away from the confrontation...					PICARD			I also have the responsibility			of bearing some unhappy news.	Spock turns back...					SPOCK			Sarek is dead.	Picard acknowledges... after a very long beat... in	a softer voice...					SPOCK			Walk with me, Captain Picard.	Picard exchanges a brief glance with Data telling him	to stay behind... follows Spock out of the chamber...2    INT. OTHER CAVERN	Picard and Spock walk silently for a beat...					SPOCK			I know of your mind meld with my			father... that enabled him to			complete his last mission.					PICARD			It was an honor. He was a great			man.   STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. II - REV. 8/30/91 - TEASER   3.2    CONTINUED:					SPOCK			He was a great representative of			the Vulcan people and of the			Federation.	And that is meant as a qualifier, not a compliment...					PICARD			I was with him before coming here.			He expressed his pride in you,			his love...					SPOCK			Emotional disarray is a symptom			of the illness from which he			suffered.					PICARD			No, the feelings were in his			heart, Spock. He shared them			with me. I know.	Spock looks at Picard a moment... uncomfortable with	the emotional context of this, he moves into business.					SPOCK			Sarek would no more approve of			my coming to Romulus than you do,			Captain.	He takes a dramatic beat to organize his thoughts...					SPOCK			For some time, I have been aware			of a growing movement here...			of people who seek to learn the			ideals of the Vulcan philosophy.			They have been declared enemies			of the state. But there are a			few in the Romulan hierarchy like			Pardek who are sympathetic. He			asked me to come now because he			believes it may be time to take			the first step toward			reunification.	Picard reacts to this extraordinary revelation...   STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. II - REV. 9/9/91 - TEASER   4.2    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Reunification... After so many			centuries... so many fundamental			differences that have evolved			between your peoples...					SPOCK				(agrees)			It would seem unlikely to succeed.			But I cannot ignore the potential			rewards that a union between our			worlds would bring.					PICARD			What is this "first step" that			Pardek suggests... ?					SPOCK			There is a new Proconsul of the			Romulan Senate. He is young and			idealistic. He has promised many			reforms. Pardek believes he may			be receptive to discussing			reunification.	Picard takes a moment to digest it all.					PICARD			Why would you not bring something			this important to the attention			of your own people or the			Federation?	Spock takes a beat to consider his response, it raises	unhappy memories.					SPOCK			A personal decision, Captain.				(beat)			Perhaps you are aware that I			played a small role in the first			overture to peace with the			Klingons...					PICARD			History is aware of the role you			played, Ambassador.					SPOCK			Not entirely. It was I who asked			Kirk to lead that peace mission.					(MORE)   STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. II - REV. 9/9/91 - TEASER   5.2    CONTINUED: (3)					SPOCK (cont'd)			And I who had to accept the			responsibility for the			consequences to him and his crew.				(beat)			Quite simply, I am unwilling to			risk anyone's life but my own on			this occasion. I would ask you			to respect my wishes and leave.	Picard considers this a moment.					PICARD			Ambassador, your logic escapes			me. If I didn't know better, I			would say your judgment had been			influenced by emotion.					SPOCK			You speak as my father would if			he were here, Picard...					PICARD			I speak as a Starfleet officer			and I cannot ignore the risks to			you...					SPOCK			I was involved with... "cowboy			diplomacy", as you describe it,			Captain, long before you were			born.					PICARD			Nevertheless, sir, I am not			prepared to leave until your			affairs are completed.					SPOCK				(beat)			In your own way, you are as			stubborn as another Captain of			the Enterprise I once knew.					PICARD			Then, sir, I am in good company.	As Spock reluctantly acknowledges and accepts Picard's	continued presence with a nod...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                             STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt.

KLINGON BRIDGE	Data, still in disguise, has just returned from the	surface... Captain K'VADA reacts to the news with	irritation... the Conn and Tactical Officers observe.					K'VADA			We have more important things to			attend to than acting as your			nursemaids.					DATA			Captain Picard regrets that he			must detain you but it is			necessary for a while longer.			In addition, I will be requiring			access to your ship's computer...					K'VADA				(reacts, suspicious)			Access to our computer... for what			purpose?					DATA			I am going to attempt to penetrate			the Romulan Central Information			Net...					K'VADA			Don't bother. We've been trying			for years.					DATA			I have unique skills that may			permit me to succeed.					K'VADA			I cannot reveal classified Klingon			entry codes to Starfleet...					DATA			Your entry codes can be easily			reconfigured after we depart.			And Captain Picard has authorized			me to share with you any			information we obtain from the			Romulan data banks...	The Klingon frowns, grunts -- "Fine...

We			would use a Romulan signal as a			carrier for own own, thus			disguising its origin.					K'VADA			It won't work.					DATA			I believe it will. During the			last hour, I have conducted a			systematic review of the entire			Romulan subspace grid and compared			my findings with the			specifications of your			transmission array.

I have a			difficult time accepting that.					SPOCK			I sense you have a closed mind,			Captain. Closed minds have kept			these two worlds apart for			centuries.	Picard reacts with curiosity to this conflict...	because Spock has really brought something of his	own to the table...					SPOCK				(continuing)			In the Federation, we have learned			from experience to view the			Romulans with distrust. We can			either choose to live with that			enmity or seek an opportunity to			change it. I choose the latter...					PICARD			I will be the first to cheer when			the Neutral Zone is abolished,			sir. I only wonder if this			movement is strong enough to			reshape the entire Romulan			political landscape.	Spock takes a beat... nodding to the flower on the	table...					SPOCK			One can begin to reshape the			landscape with a single flower,			Captain.	But he's not at peace as he says it, experiencing	additional conflicts within himself...  STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt.

But I have			learned to listen carefully.			Children like D'Tan are our			future. Old men like me will not			be able to hold on to ancient			prejudice and hostility. These			young people won't allow it.				(beat)			Now that they've met their first			real Vulcan, it has only inspired			them more. I'm sure that is			evident to you, Spock...					SPOCK				(acknowledges)			I did not anticipate such a			passionate response to my arrival.					PARDEK			Romulans are a passionate people,			Spock.
