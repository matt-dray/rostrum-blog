The SOUND of unattended	subspace MESSAGES can be heard playing -- a cacophony	of voices and signals and static -- weird and	disorienting. They react to the noise.					WORF			What is that noise?					GEORDI				(over the din)			They must've left the audio			monitoring system on!

Finally, the subspace	messages STOP playing. He breathes a sigh of relief,	turns to join the others...	And hesitates, hearing something. He listens intently.	There is a faint THUMPING sound coming from somewhere	nearby.					GEORDI				(to Riker)			Commander...	Riker walks over and Geordi motions toward the	direction of the sound. They follow the thumping noise	across the room... down along a wall... and toward a	service duct OPENING near the floor.					GEORDI			It's coming from inside this			service duct... could be a loose			cover plate...	Riker kneels down beside the small entrance. The	thumping grows LOUDER. Riker and Geordi exchange a	mystified look.        STAR TREK: "Aquiel" - REV. 11/09/92 - TEASER        5.7    CONTINUED:	Riker carefully looks into the service duct...8    ANGLE IN SERVICE DUCT	A medium-sized female DOG is sitting in the shaft, her	tail wagging, thumping against the metal.9    RESUME SCENE	The dog comes out of the duct and licks Riker's face.					RIKER				(to Geordi)			Here's your loose cover plate...	Geordi kneels down to pet the dog.					GEORDI			Hey there, pooch...	Worf returns from the quarters.					WORF			The shuttlecraft is gone.

There are	smears of BLOOD on a nearby console. Several pieces of	equipment are overturned. Evidence of a struggle.	They react as they see that something's happened here.	Beverly indicates an area of the floor she is scanning --	a three foot square section which has been MELTED and	is surrounded by nasty-looking scorch marks. Blood and	a dark, hardened FLUID can been seen mixed in with the	twisted metal.        STAR TREK: "Aquiel" - REV. 11/09/92 - TEASER        6.10   CONTINUED:					RIKER				(re: the stain)			What is it?					BEVERLY			Cellular residue...

He taps a	button and the doors SLIDE OPEN...16   INT. RELAY STATION - AQUIEL'S QUARTERS	Geordi ENTERS with the dog. The room is decorated with	exotic artwork... various personal items can be seen...	the bed is unmade. The place is cramped, but it has a	comfortable, "lived in" look. There is a desk with a	workstation. Geordi sits down and activates the	MONITOR -- it shows STATIC.       STAR TREK: "Aquiel" - REV. 11/09/92 - ACT ONE       10.16   CONTINUED:	Geordi now opens a MEES PANEL on the wall, begins to	adjust the inner-workings with one of his tools. As he	works, he casually talks to the dog...					GEORDI			All right... what do you say we			try repolarizing the interface...	A beat. Then we HEAR a burst of garbled VOICES and	STATIC. Geordi glances at the monitor -- it hasn't	changed. He plugs the computer module into a	corresponding slot on this terminal.	From offscreen, the dog WHINES. Surprised, Geordi	turns to look -- the dog is sitting nearby, staring up	at a shelf. Geordi stands, moves to the shelf, which	holds several knick-knacks and a JEWELLED HEADBAND. He	can't resist picking it up and examining it.					GEORDI				(re: headband)			This doesn't look like yours...	Geordi looks on the shelf again and sees a dog's BONE.	Geordi picks up the bone.					GEORDI				(re: bone)			Is this what you're looking for?	He tosses the bone to the dog, who takes it happily.	Geordi looks at the headband for another beat then he	replaces it on the shelf and eyes a few other items on	the shelf... he's intrigued...	Geordi returns to the wall panel... makes a final	adjustment to the circuitry, then taps a control on the	monitor.					GEORDI			Computer, run station logs in			sequence.	A burst of static -- then we HEAR the VOICE of Aquiel	Uhnari.

Geordi glances	down.					GEORDI				(to dog)			Come on now... stop it...	He nudges her away and continues to work. The dog	stands back and stares at him a moment... then it	begins to quietly GROWL in an eerie way.	Geordi keeps working, oblivious to the dog. Then he	finally hears the growling... turns toward the dog...	sees it growling and stands, alarmed.					GEORDI			Maura... ?	Without warning, the dog TRANSFORMS into a DARK,	TERRIFYING, FLUID-LOOKING CREATURE which rears up and	moves at Geordi -- it's the coalescent creature.	Geordi reacts, shocked, and leaps out of the way. The	creature goes after him, roaring --	Geordi scrambles out of the way as the creature makes	several frightening LUNGES toward him. He runs into a	table and almost falls -- manages to stay on his feet,	only to find himself being backed into a corner as the	creature moves inexorably closer...	The creature makes a final LUNGE. Geordi jumps toward	a nearby desk -- opens a drawer and grabs out a phaser.	He aims at the creature and FIRES --	The creature is JOLTED back -- but quickly recovers and	moves to attack again, roaring, furious.61A  INSERT - PHASER	as Geordi rapidly taps the phaser, adjusting the force	setting to level fourteen.61B  RESUME	as Geordi aims and FIRES at the creature with an	intense, sustained BURST. The creature DISINTEGRATES	in a FLASH OF LIGHT. Gone.	OFF Geordi's startled reaction...                                             CUT TO:           STAR TREK: "Aquiel" - REV. 11/05/92 - ACT FIVE           58.62   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	At impulse.63   INT. TEN FORWARD	Geordi and Aquiel are sitting at one of the tables.	Aquiel is trying to make sense of everything that has	happened.					GEORDI			Maybe the reason you don't			remember what happened after Rocha			attacked you... is that the			coalescing process had begun...			remember you felt like the			memories had been drained right			out of you? That's probably just			what happened...					AQUIEL			Then... maybe I did take the			phaser...					GEORDI			Whatever happened, at least you			got away.					AQUIEL			So he turned on Maura.	There is a small silence as they sip their drinks...	not quite knowing where to take the conversation.					GEORDI			Well. What now?					AQUIEL			I guess I'll be going to Starbase			Two-Twelve for re-assignment.	Another silence.					GEORDI				(trying to be casual)			You know... I had a talk with			Chief Pendleton in Communications.			There's an opening for a level two			specialist.	She stares at him, surprised.           STAR TREK: "Aquiel" - REV. 11/05/92 - ACT FIVE           59.63   CONTINUED:					AQUIEL			Really?				(beat)			I'm sure there's a waiting list so			long I'd be grey before I got			here.					GEORDI				(off-hand)			I could put in a good word.	She eyes him... understanding what he's saying, and	appreciating it... but needing to stay her own person.					AQUIEL			It's an appealing offer...				(beat)			But I think I'd rather get here on			my own merits.	He smiles... it's exactly what he expected her to	say... and he wouldn't have it any other way.					AQUIEL			Don't be surprised if you see my			name at the end of that list.	They share a look... which holds promise for the	future.                                             FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
