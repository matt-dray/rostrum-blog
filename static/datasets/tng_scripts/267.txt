TEN FORWARD	TROI and RIKER are sitting at a table looking over a	PADD. The usual complement of N.D's fill the room.	A waiter stands at a nearby table, wiping it clean.	His name is BEN, and though Riker and Troi don't	notice, he's eavesdropping on their conversation.					RIKER			Fletcher has more experience with			propulsion systems --					TROI			But Carstairs is better with			people. Considering this is a			supervisory position, I'd go with			her.					RIKER				(considers)			You're probably right...	Riker works the PADD, leans back and rubs his eyes as	if they're tired.					RIKER				(continuing)			Didn't we just finish a Crew			Evaluation Report?					TROI				(smiles)			That was three months ago.					RIKER			Feels like three weeks. Maybe we			should just give everyone a			promotion and call it a night.				(smiles)			What do you say... Commander?					TROI				(smiles)			Fine with me...

As we'll see, the Nova Squadron	incident has left Sito a little unsure of herself;	determined to get her career back on track but	desperate to avoid making another mistake, she's become	very cautious, very by-the-book.	The group is rounded out by a Vulcan male named TAURIK	and a human male named LAVELLE. Like Sito, they are	both in their early to mid-twenties. Lavelle is	bright, handsome and personable -- think of Riker	twelve years ago. Taurik is extremely intelligent and	knows it -- he has enormous confidence in his own	abilities.					LAVELLE			Why do they keep laughing? What's			so funny about Crew Evaluations?					OGAWA			Don't worry about it, Sam.					SITO			Let's just try and have a good			time.					LAVELLE			How can I have a good time when my			career's being decided across the			room?	Lavelle crosses his fingers, closes his eyes...					LAVELLE				(continuing, quiet)			Think promotion... promotion...			promotion...	Taurik regards him disapprovingly.					TAURIK			You can't really believe this will			influence the outcome of your			evaluation?	Lavelle ignores him, continues his quiet chant. The	others see Taurik's annoyance and can't resist teasing	him.         STAR TREK: "Lower Decks" 11/17/93 - TEASER         3.2    CONTINUED:					OGAWA			It's a time-honored strategy,			Taurik.					SITO			The Vedeks of the Janalan order			maintain a round-the-clock chant			for the well-being of the Bajoran			people.					TAURIK			Considering the history of your			planet, that doesn't exactly			validate what he's doing.	Sito shrugs to concede him the point, but Lavelle is	finally exasperated by the relentlessness of Taurik's	logic. The efficacy of what Sam is doing is	questionable.					LAVELLE			Promote me, please -- so I can			make Lieutenant and have my own			room.					TAURIK			If you aren't happy sharing			quarters with me, then you should			put in for a new room assignment.				(beat)			Just in case you're not promoted.	Sito and Ogawa smile at Taurik's remark.3    ON RIKER AND TROI	Ben is approaching them with TWO COFFEES.					RIKER			I've been thinking about who to			promote to Ops --					TROI			The new night duty officer?         STAR TREK: "Lower Decks" 11/17/93 - TEASER         4.3    CONTINUED:					RIKER				(acknowledges)			Lavelle's an obvious candidate,			but I'm considering Ensign Sito as			well.	Ben sets the coffees down.					BEN				(to Troi)			You sure about dessert?					TROI			Yes. Don't tempt me.         STAR TREK: "Lower Decks" 11/17/93 - TEASER         5.3    CONTINUED: (2)	Ben smiles and moves off; we FOLLOW HIM as he	approaches the junior officer's table.	Ben is about the same age as the others; has an easy	smile and wit. He signed aboard a Starship for fun and	adventure, and as a civilian, isn't subject to the	pressures of Starfleet. He likes nothing more than to	kid his friends about how seriously they take	everything.					LAVELLE			Are they working on the crew			evaluations?					BEN			Yep.					SITO			Who were they talking about?					BEN			It's not my place to say...					SITO			Come on, Ben.					LAVELLE			Please.					BEN			All right, but I'm not sure you're			going to like it...	They react --					BEN				(continuing)			Apparently... you're both up for			the same job...	Everyone reacts. Sito and Lavelle look at each	other... wondering how this will affect their	friendship...

BRIDGE	At Red Alert, Sito is at Tactical, Lavelle at the Conn,	DATA at Ops -- Riker is giving a series of rapid-fire	orders from the Command Area. Various N.D's as needed.					RIKER			Lock phasers on target --					SITO				(works)			Phasers locked --					DATA				(off console)			The enemy vessel is firing.					RIKER			Helm, hard to starboard!					LAVELLE				(works)			Hard starboard --					RIKER			Fire phasers!	Sito works the console but it takes her a moment to	comply -- Worf turns from the aft station to watch as	she recovers and fires.					SITO			Firing --	We hear the SOUND of phasers firing.					DATA			Target is destroyed.					RIKER			End simulation sequence and secure			from drill.	Red Alert ends and Riker studies a read-out.      STAR TREK: "Lower Decks" REV. 11/23/93 - ACT ONE      6A.4    CONTINUED:					RIKER				(continuing, to all)			Alpha shift, your response time			was seven percent slower than			gamma shift --	Everyone on the Bridge reacts to this disappointing	news.4A   INT. ENGINEERING	where Taurik, Geordi, and a few N.D's are listening.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			I'd like all departments to submit			drill evaluation reports by oh			nine hundred hours --					GEORDI			Ensign, you'll write that report.					TAURIK			Yes, sir.4B   INT. BRIDGE	Continuous.					RIKER			Let's see if we can find a way to			close that gap.	Riker turns to Sito.					RIKER				(continuing)			What happened back there, Ensign?         STAR TREK: "Lower Decks" 11/17/93 - ACT ONE         7.4B   CONTINUED:	Sito explains, a little nervously.					SITO			I'm sorry, sir. When we changed			course I had to re-lock the			phasers before I could fire.					RIKER			Next time try letting the locking			relay float until the actual order			to fire is given.	Sito acknowledges.					RIKER				(continuing)			They may not teach that trick at			the Academy, but it works.					SITO			Thank you, sir.	Riker turns to Lavelle.					RIKER			Lavelle...					LAVELLE			Sir?	There is a moment of anticipation on Lavelle's face, as	if he's hoping to be complimented.					RIKER			Resume previous course and speed.	A flicker of disappointment crosses Lavelle's features.					LAVELLE				(all business)			Aye, aye sir.					RIKER			One "aye" is sufficient			acknowledgment, Ensign.	Lavelle's face flushes with embarrassment. PICARD	ENTERS from the Ready Room and approaches Riker.         STAR TREK: "Lower Decks" 11/17/93 - ACT ONE         8.4B   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Helm, change course for the Argaya			system -- maximum warp.					LAVELLE			Aye, sir.					RIKER			What about our rendezvous with the			Clement?					PICARD			I've just received new orders from			Starfleet. We'll discuss it in			the Observation Lounge.	Data stands to join Picard and Worf as they cross	toward the Observation Lounge. Lavelle looks over at	Data's vacant chair -- someone is going to have to man	Ops and he hopes he is chosen. Riker glances at him,	then back toward Sito.					RIKER			Ensign Sito, you'll fill in at			Ops.	Lavelle tries not to show his disappointment.					SITO			Yes, sir.	She crosses toward the chair as the senior officers	EXIT into the Observation Lounge.	She takes a seat and orients herself, pushes a few	controls. It's an awkward moment; the two friends are	still grappling with the fact that they're competitors,	and now they have to sit side by side. She senses	Lavelle's disappointment that he wasn't chosen and	tries to steer the conversation elsewhere.					SITO				(continuing, quiet)			The Argaya system is close to the			Cardassian border; I wonder why			we're going there.	He shrugs, doesn't join in her speculation.         STAR TREK: "Lower Decks" 11/17/93 - ACT ONE         9.4B   CONTINUED: (3)					SITO				(continuing)			How would you like to be a spider			under that table?					LAVELLE				(turns to her)			What?					SITO				(gesturing back toward				 the Observation lounge)			A spider under the table --					LAVELLE			Is that like a fly on the wall?					SITO				(smiles)			I guess so.	He smiles -- the awkwardness between them evaporates.	(NOTE: as they talk, they should occasionally work	their controls.)					SITO				(continuing)			You did really well during the			drill.					LAVELLE			Apparently Commander Riker didn't			think so. I swear he's got it in			for me.					SITO			You're imagining things.					LAVELLE			Oh, yeah? Then how come you're			sitting in that chair instead of			me?	Sito tries to make light of it.					SITO			Maybe he figured I need more			practice than you do.	He smiles and they turn their attentions to their	consoles...

What is it?					TAURIK			I'd like you to take a look at			something.	Geordi smiles slightly. Apparently this isn't unusual	for Taurik.					GEORDI			Have you been improvising again,			Ensign?					TAURIK			In a manner of speaking. I'm			running a computer simulation to			test a new warp-field			configuration.	Geordi studies the console indicated by Taurik.					GEORDI			You've got a problem right here...			the plasma flow in the nacelles is			out of sync.					TAURIK			Actually, sir, that was done			deliberately.	Geordi reacts; clearly this isn't how it's ordinarily	done.					TAURIK				(continuing)			As you can see, this configuration			has increased overall warp-field			integrity by seven percent.					GEORDI				(off console)			You're right...     STAR TREK: "Lower Decks" REV. 11/23/93 - ACT ONE     10A.6    CONTINUED:					TAURIK			Doctor Nils Diaz has been			experimenting with this technique			at the Tanaline Propulsion			Laboratory.	Geordi is studying the read-outs.					GEORDI			I know his work, but I never heard			anything about this...					TAURIK			His findings have not been			released yet. I was able to			review a preliminary report when			I was at the Academy.					GEORDI			I'll look forward to reading about			it...					TAURIK			I predict that when these findings			are made public, they will become			a new model for warp field			operation.					GEORDI			Sounds interesting.					TAURIK			With your permission, I would like			to begin tests to see if the			technique can be adapted to our			warp drive.	Geordi studies the monitor as he considers...        STAR TREK: "Lower Decks" 11/17/93 - ACT ONE        11.6    CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			I don't know...
