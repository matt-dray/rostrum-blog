                        April 13, 1987


                            TEASER                              

	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - STARSHIP (OPTICAL)

	The U.S.S. Enterprise NCC 1701-D traveling at warp speed
	through space.

					PICARD V.O.
			Captain's log, stardate 42353.7.
			Our destination is planet Cygnus
			IV, beyond which lies the great
			unexplored mass of the galaxy.

2    OTHER INTRODUCTORY ANGLES (OPTICAL)

	on the gigantic new Enterprise NCC 1701-D.

					PICARD V.O.
			My orders are to examine Farpoint,
			a starbase built there by the
			inhabitants of that world.
			Meanwhile ...

3    INT. ENGINE ROOM

	Huge, with a giant wall diagram showing the immensity
	of this Galaxy Class starship.

					PICARD V.O.
				(continuing)
			... I am becoming better
			acquainted with my new command,
			this Galaxy Class U.S.S.
			Enterprise.

4    CLOSER ON VESSEL DIAGRAM

	Showing the details and size of this enormous starship.

					PICARD V.O.
			I am still somewhat in awe of its
			size and complexity.

5    INT. LOUNGE DECK

	With its huge windows revealing the immense span of the
	Starship's outer surface.


5    CONTINUED:

					PICARD V.O.
				(continuing)
			... my crew we are short in
			several key positions, most
			notably ...

6    INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

	PICARD, TROI, and DATA seated in the command area.
	Starfleet LIEUTENANT WORF, a young Klingon, is at the
	"Ops" station and a SUPERNUMERARY is at "Conn".

					PICARD V.O.
				(continuing)
			... a first officer, but I am
			informed that a highly experienced
			man, one Commander William Riker,
			will be waiting to join our ship
			when we reach our Cygnus IV
			destination.

7    ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND DATA

	As Picard turns to Data:

					PICARD
			You will agree, Data, that
			Starfleet's instructions are
			difficult?

					DATA
			Difficult ... how so? Simply
			solve the mystery of Farpoint
			Station.

					PICARD
				(smiles)
			As simple as that.

					TROI
			Farpoint Station. Even the name
			sounds mysterious.

					PICARD
			The problem, Data, is that another
			life form built that base. How
			do I negotiate a friendly
			agreement for Starfleet to use
			it while at the same time snoop
			around finding how and why they
			built it?


7    CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Inquiry ... the word snoop ... ?

					PICARD
			Data, how can you be programmed
			as a virtual encyclopedia of human
			information without knowing a
			simple word like snoop?

					DATA
			Possibility ... a kind of human
			behavior I was not designed to
			emulate?

	It is all Troi can do to keep from smiling.

					PICARD
			It means 'to spy, to sneak' ...

					DATA
				(interrupting;
				 delighted)
			Ah! To seek covertly, to go
			stealthily, to slink, slither ...

					PICARD
				(wanting to cut it off)
			Exactly, yes ...

					DATA
			... to glide, creep, skulk,
			pussyfoot, gumshoe ...

	Data trails off his words, finally becoming aware of
	the annoyance registering on Picard's face. Troi cannot
	keep back the smile now ... then suddenly her face is
	contorted in pain.

					TROI
			Captain ... I'm sensing a ... a
			powerful mind ...

	Interrupted by the sound of a BRIDGE ALARM.

8    WIDER ANGLE

	All checking their consoles, puzzled at readings they're
	getting.

					WORF
			Something strange on the detector
			circuits ...


8    CONTINUED:

	OVERLAPPED by an ever more compelling SECOND BRIDGE
	ALARM (similar to the old naval HONKING SOUND) begins
	to sound. At the same time, the main viewer FLICKERS
	and an unusual SHINING, SPARKLING GRID SHAPE APPEARS
	stretching across the whole of the galaxy ahead of them.

9    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND GRID (OPTICAL)

	Emphasizing the incredibly SHINING GRID which the
	Enterprise is approaching. Seeming impossibly large,
	yet in some ways as delicate as a spiderweb, it is
	composed of interlocking geometrical shapes.

10   INT. BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES

	Data is looking up from his command position console,
	showing as much alarm as we'll ever see on his face.

					DATA
			It registers as solid, Captain...

					TROI
			Or an incredibly powerful
			forcefield. But if we collide
			with either ...

					PICARD
				(to Conn)
			Go to Condition Yellow. And shut
			off that damned noise.

	Conn turns OFF honking sound. Picard is taking time to
	check all readings but we're now coming very close to
	the strange grid.

					WORF
			Shields and deflectors, up, sir.

	Milking the drama of approaching collision. Then,
	conversationally:

					PICARD
			Reverse power, full stop.

					CONN
			Controls to full stop, sir.

	The strange shimmering GRID on the viewer is now very
	close to us as Enterprise movement stops.

					CONN
			Now reading full stop, sir.


10   CONTINUED:

	Overlapped by something akin to a ROLLING THUNDER STORM
	accompanied by a BRILLIANT AND SUSTAINED FLASH OF LIGHT
	ON THE BRIDGE to the side of Picard. The light burst
	physically shakes all bridge crew for an instant, then
	RESOLVES ITSELF INTO A HUMAN SIZE FIGURE standing at
	that point on the bridge. As the bridge crew's eyes
	adjust, it does indeed appear to be a human ... but one
	dressed and posturing as an Elizabethan era sea captain
	complete with Sir Walter Raleigh type "court dress",
	complete with neck ruffles, lace, leg stockings,
	ceremonial sword, etc. Now and later, we shall know
	this life form as "Q".

11   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	as "Q" (Elizabethan) makes a formal bow (of that same
	era) to Picard. At which the turbolift doors snap open
	and TWO SECURITY CREW members start to ENTER, led by
	Security and Weapons Officer NATASHA YAR. However, "Q"
	merely gives a nod in that direction and a miniature of
	the space grid outside APPEARS AT THE TURBOLIFT
	ENTRANCE, barring the security team's entrance and
	CLOSES THE TURBOLIFT DOORS. Then "Q" turns toward
	Picard.

					"Q" (ELIZABETHAN)
			You are notified that your kind
			has infiltrated the galaxy too
			far already. You are directed
			to return to your own solar system
			immediately.

12   ANGLE TO INCLUDE OPS AND CONN

	We will see Conn stealthily, carefully reaching to the
	small phaser on his belt.

					PICARD
			That's quite a directive. Would
			you mind identifying what you are?

					"Q" (ELIZABETHAN)
			We call ourselves "the Q". Or
			you may call me that; it's all
			much the same thing.
				(indicating costume)
			And I have presented myself to
			you as a fellow ship captain so
			that you will better understand
			me.
				(indicates)
			Go back from where you...


13   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Interrupted by Conn drawing his phaser. But "Q" barely
	nods toward Conn at which a FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE
	envelopes that bridge crewman, and we HEAR THE BRIEF
	BEGINNINGS OF A SCREAM as Conn falls with the SOUND of
	a frozen hard object striking the deck. Picard comes
	to his feet, ignoring "Q" as:

					"Q" (ELIZABETHAN)
			Stay where you are!

14   EMPHASIZING PICARD

	Who is clearly very angry as he kneels at the prone form
	of Conn who appears to have been instantly frozen solid.
	Troi hurries INTO SHOT kneeling too. There is even
	white evaporation vapor rising up from the body.

					PICARD
			Data, call medics!

					TROI
			He's frozen. Can you feel the
			cold?

	Picard grabs up Conn's phaser from the deck (reversing
	it, wisely), stands and puts it under "Q's" nose.

					PICARD
			He would not have injured you!
				(indicates phaser)
			Do you understand this; the stun
			setting?

					"Q" (ELIZABETHAN)
			Knowing humans as you do, Captain,
			would you want to be captured
			helpless by them?
				(moves closer)
			Now, go back or you will certainly
			die!

									FADE OUT:


                           PART ONE                             

	FADE IN:

15   EXT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE AND GRID (OPTICAL)

	Appropriate THEME MUSIC with spaceship hanging
	motionless, still facing the mysterious SHIMMERING GRID
	that stretches in front of it from galaxy horizon to
	horizon.

16   INTO. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING CONN'S FORM

	In the b.g. on a floating stretcher Conn is being taken
	to the turbolift, advanced medical emergency aids are
	attached to his body.

					PICARD
			Is he still alive?

					MEDIC
			For now. We'll do our best, sir.

17   EMPHASIZING "Q" (OPTICAL)

	Ignoring the previous, intent instead on inspecting his
	Elizabethan costume as Picard comes up to him.

					"Q" (ELIZABETHAN)
			Your little centuries go by so
			rapidly, Captain. Perhaps you'll
			understand this better.

	The Visitor moves his hand slightly. We hear the same
	ROLLING THUNDER SOUND. Another BLINDING LIGHT FLASH
	and his body remains the same humanoid face and figure
	as with the Elizabethan dress, but now the green
	officer's uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps. Over his
	jacket pocket three rows of medals and his narrow
	garrison cap shows the bars of a Captain.

					"Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN)
			Actually, the issue at stake is
			patriotism. You must return to
			your world and put an end to the
			communists. All it takes is a
			few good men.

					PICARD
			What? That nonsense is centuries
			behind us!


17   CONTINUED:

					"Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN)
			But you can't deny Captain, that
			you're still a dangerous, savage
			child-race.

					PICARD
			Most certainly I deny it. I agree
			that we still were when ...
				(indicating)
			... humans wore costumes like that
			four hundred years ago...

					"Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN)
			At which time you slaughtered
			millions in silly arguments about
			how to divide the resources of
			your little world. And four
			hundred years before that you were
			murdering each other in quarrels
			over tribal god-images. And since
			there have been no indications
			that humans will ever change
			.....

					PICARD
			But even as far back as... !
				(indicates)
			... that costume, we had begun to
			make rapid progress.

					"Q" (MARINE CAPTAIN)
			Oh? Shall we review your "rapid
			progress"?

18   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	The "Q" visitor moves a hand again to create THE SAME
	SOUNDS and the SAME BLINDING FLASH, producing the same
	human image but this time unshaven and with an UGLY
	AUTOMATION LOOK AND IN THE UNIFORM OF A MILITARY OFFICER
	FROM THE MID 21st CENTURY WARS. Q's voice sounds a bit
	drugged now as he eyes his new costume.

					"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
				(interrupting)
			Rapid progress to where humans
			learned to control their military
			with drugs.

19   ANGLE INCLUDING OPS POSITION

	As Worf gets a message and turns toward Picard.


19   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			Sir, sickbay reports that
			Lieutenant Graham's condition is
			better.

	All have turned toward Worf, showing relief.

					"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
			Concern for one's comrade. How
			touching.

					WORF
				(indicates "Q")
			And now, sir, a personal request.
			Permission to clean up the bridge?

	Picard shakes head, stares Worf down when he seems about
	to protest. Meanwhile Tasha has come to her feet too:

					TASHA
			Lieutenant Worf is right, sir.
			As Security Chief I can't just
			stand here and ....

					PICARD
			Yes, you can, Tasha.

	During this, "Q" has withdrawn a slender tube attached
	to his 21st Century uniform, makes an adjustment which
	lets a round pill roll into his mouth and bites down
	on it with a "POP" SOUND.

					"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
			Ah, yes... better!
				(deep breath, feeling
				 it)
			Then later, on finally reaching
			deep space, humans of course found
			enemies to fight out there too.
			And to broaden those struggles....
				(indicating Worf and
				 Tasha)
			.... you again found allies to
			permit still more murdering and
			all over again the same old story.


19   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
				(interrupting; angry)
			No! The most dangerous 'same old
			story' is the one we're meeting
			now! Those who go on
			misinformation, half-information,
			self-righteous life forms who are
			eager not to learn but to
			prosecute, to judge anything they
			don't understand or can't
			tolerate.

					"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
			What an interesting idea.
			Prosecute and judge?

	CAMERA CENTERS ON "Q" as he absorbs what Picard has
	said. He takes a step or two, turns.

					"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
				(continuing)
			And suppose it turns out we
			understand you humans only too
			well?

					PICARD
			We've no fear of what the true
			facts about us will reveal.

					"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
			The facts about you? Splendid,
			splendid! You are a veritable
			fountain of good ideas.
				(smiling; pleasant)
			There are preparations to make,
			Captain, but when I return...

	"Q" gives a 21st Century salute to Picard.

					"Q" (21ST CENTURY)
				(continuing)
			... we will proceed exactly as you
			suggest!

	A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT and the alien visitor is gone.

20   WIDE ANGLE ON BRIDGE

	It takes a moment to accept the fact "Q" is really gone
	then Worf turns to Picard.


20   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			Sir... respectfully submit our only
			choice is to fight. If we
			Klingons understand anything, it
			is the meaning of that kind of
			talk.

					TASHA
			My sentiments too, sir. Fight or
			try to escape.

21   ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD

	Turning to Troi:

					PICARD
			Sense anything, Commander?

					TROI
				(shakes head)
			Its mind is much too powerful,
			sir. And frightening. Concur we
			avoid further contact if possible!

22   ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD

	Clearly he has to come up with something. He reflects
	for a moment more, then makes up his mind, turns to
	Troi.

					PICARD
			From this point, no station
			aboard, repeat no station, for
			any reason will make use of
			signals, transmission or intercom.
				(crossing quickly to
				 Ops and Conn)
			We'll try to take them by
			surprise.
				(to Worf)
			Inform engineering to make ready
			for maximum acceleration. We'll
			find out what this Galaxy Class
			can do.

					WORF
			Aye, sir.

	As Worf stands and hurries off, Picard turns to Data.


22   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Records search, Data. Results
			of detaching the Saucer Section
			at high warp speeds.

	Data quickly draws on his memory.

					DATA
			Inadvisable at any warp speed,
			sir.

					PICARD
			Search theoretical.

					DATA
				(thinking; then)
			It is possible, sir. But
			absolutely no error margin.

	Picard nods and stands, RAISES VOICE:

					PICARD
			Attention bridge crew!

23   VARIOUS ANGLES

	Picard waits until all are turned toward him.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Using print-out only, notify all
			decks to prepare for maximum
			acceleration. Maximum, you're
			entitled to know, means we'll be
			pushing our engines well past
			safety limits. Our hope is to
			surprise whatever that is out
			there, try to outrun it.
				(looks around, then)
			Our only other option would be
			to put tail between our legs and
			return to Earth as they demand.

24   INT. ENGINE ROOM - TRAVELING WITH WORF

	As he takes us into WIDE CAMERA ANGLE, aiming both for
	a feeling of the starship's huge size and enormous
	power.


25   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Worf nodding at a reading which an Engineer shows him,
	then EXITING to return to the bridge. Meanwhile,
	engineering personnel work at their controls and a LOW
	PITCHED WHINE quickly works itself up into a DEAFENING
	HIGH PITCHED SHRIEK while ENERGY DISPLAYS APPEAR AT MAIN
	ENGINE CONNECTIONS.

26   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	Showing both the Enterprise and the mysterious grid.

27   INT. BRIDGE - ANGLES INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER

	Worf enters bridge from turbolift, crossing to his
	position.

					WORF
			Engine room ready, sir.

	Picard stands behind Data who is at the Conn position.

					TROI
			The board shows 'green', Captain.
			All go!

	Picard moving back to his command position as:

					PICARD
			Stand by...
				(takes his seat, checks
				 bridge, then)
			ENGAGE!

	The entire bridge SHUDDERS under a SCREAM OF POWER as
	we

									CUT TO:

28   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	Suddenly into maximum warp, the energy release
	momentarily DISTORTING BOTH THE ALIEN GRID AND THE STARS
	IN SIGHT AROUND IT. When the EFFECT is over, the
	starship has turned, seeming to almost brush against
	the mysterious grid, and is then racing away from it.

29   ANGLE EMPHASIZING GRID (OPTICAL)

	With Enterprise in b.g. at warp speed, escaping. Then
	the 'grid' suddenly shrinks in size, growing brighter
	as it coalesces together INTO THE SHAPE OF A BRIGHTLY
	COLORED SPINNING SHAPE which now races after the
	Enterprise.

30   INT. BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES

	The faces of the bridge crew reflect the fact that
	Enterprise is at very high warp speed and continuing
	to accelerate into even higher warp.

					WORF
			Velocity warp nine point two.

					DATA
			Heading, 351 Mark 11, sir.

					PICARD
			Steady on that.

					TASHA
			The hostile is now giving chase,
			sir. Accelerating fast.

					WORF
			We're now at Warp nine point
			three, sir. Which takes us past
			the red line, sir.

					PICARD
			Continue accelerating.
				(to Troi)
			Counselor, at this point I'm open
			even to guesses about what we've
			just met.

					TROI
				(considers, then)
			It... it felt like something beyond
			what we'd consider a 'life form'.

					PICARD
			'Beyond'?

					TROI
			Very, very advanced, sir. Or...
				(considers)
			Or certainly, very, very
			different!

30   CONTINUED:

					WORF
				(with emphasis now)
			Sir, we're at warp nine point
			four.

					TASHA
			Hostile is now beginning to
			overtake us, sir.

					PICARD
			Are you sure?

					DATA
			Hostile's velocity is already warp
			nine point six, sir. Shall I
			put them on main viewer?

					PICARD
				(nods)
			Reverse angle on viewer.

31   ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER

	VIEWER IMAGE SHIMMERS into reverse view, which is much
	the same as the forward view except for ONE BLINKING
	POINT OF LIGHT AT IMAGE CENTER.

					DATA
			Magnifying viewer image.

	ANOTHER VIEWER SHIMMER with the CENTER POINT OF LIGHT
	BECOMING THE SPINNING COALESCENCE seen earlier. It's
	still far away, tiny in size, but will grow in size
	during later SCENES.

32   VARIOUS ANGLES

	as needed.

					TASHA
			Hostile's velocity now at nine
			point seven, sir.

					PICARD
			Ops, inform Engineering we need
			more!

					DATA
			Engine room attempting to comply,
			sir. But they caution us...

32   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(interrupting; to Data)
			Go to yellow alert!

	Data hits a control and the Yellow Alert ALARM SOUNDS
	FIVE TIMES. Then Picard turns to Tasha.

					PICARD
				(to Tasha)
			Arm photon torpedoes, Weapons
			Station. Place them on ready
			status.

					TASHA
			Torpedoes to ready, sir.

	Picard is aware of the concerned glances received form
	Troi and Data.

33   WIDE ANGLE

	The entire bridge suddenly SHUDDERS HARD and it brings
	startled looks to the faces of some of the bridge crew.
	Then the motion eases.

					WORF
			That was a design tremor, sir.
			A warning.

					TASHA
			Hostile now at warp nine point
			eight, sir.

					WORF
			Our velocity is only nine point
			five, sir.

					DATA
			Projection, sir. We may be able
			to match the hostile's nine point
			eight, sir. But at extreme risk.

					TASHA
			Now reading the hostile at warp
			nine point nine, sir.

	Picard stands, raising his voice to carry throughout
	the bridge.

33   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Attention bridge. Print-out
			message, urgent, to all decks.
				(selecting the right
				 words)
			All stations on all decks, make
			ready to detach ship's saucer
			section.

	Some of the bridge crew is startled but all are soon
	putting their consoles in order for the move. Picard
	turns to Worf at 'conn' position.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			You will command the saucer
			section, Lieutenant.

	Worf comes to his feet in protest.

					WORF
			I am a Klingon, sir. For me to
			seek escape while my captain goes
			into battle....

					PICARD
				(interrupts hard)
			You are a Starfleet officer,
			Lieutenant.

					WORF
				(hesitates, takes seat)
			Aye, sir.

					PICARD
				(to bridge again)
			Note in ship's log that at this
			startime, I am transferring
			command to the Battle Bridge.
				(to Data)
			Make the signal, Data.

	Data touches a control and we HEAR (still preserved from
	surface ship days) the BUGLE CALL "BEAT TO QUARTERS"
	which continues REPEATING as all bridge crew members
	(except Worf) begin leaving their posts. While
	SUPERNUMERARIES arrive on the turbolifts, our bridge
	crew begins exiting the bridge.

									FADE OUT.

                           PART TWO                             

	FADE IN:

34   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	Still at high warp. We cannot see the image of the
	following "hostile" (which is not magnified in this
	ANGLE).

					PICARD V.O.
			Captain's log, stardate 42354.1.
			Preparing to detach saucer
			section.

35   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE

	As the turbolift doors snap open, Picard and the others
	ENTER the smaller, sparse and functional Battle Bridge.

					PICARD V.O.
			... so that families and the majority
			of the ship's company...

36   INT. MONTAGE OF SAUCER SETS

	Families, children, science technicians, etc., moving
	into safe areas.

					PICARD V.O.
				(continuing)
			... can seek relative safety while
			our vessel's stardrive, containing
			our Battle Bridge...

37   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES

	Acquainting us with the smaller and more severe battle
	bridge, its configuration and positions. Picard is
	speaking the balance of his log entry to the microphone
	at his command position.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			... and main armaments, will turn
			back and confront the mystery that
			is threatening us.
				(turning to Tasha)
			Lieutenant, your torpedoes must
			detonate close enough to the
			hostile to blind it at the moment
			we separate.

37   CONTINUED:

					TASHA
			Understood, sir.

					PICARD
			Worf, this is the Captain....

38   INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING LT. WORF

	The young Klingon at the Captain's command station now.

					WORF
			Yes Captain?

					PICARD'S INTERCOM VOICE
			Begin countdown....
				(touches panel control)
			Mark!

39   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	Traveling through space for a moment, then photon
	torpedoes blasting out of the starship's aft tubes.
	The torpedo pattern disappears into the distance behind
	the vessel.

40   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE

	All intent on what is happening as:

					TROI
			All decks acknowledging, sir.

					DATA
			Starship separation.... six, five,
			four, three, two, one....

41   EXT. ENTERPRISE - ANGLES ON SEPARATION MECHANISM (OPTICAL))

	As we see the largest of the assemblies begin to move,
	yawning open. Other mechanisms are doing their jobs
	too.... and THE MONOLITHIC STARSHIP DIVIDES INTO ITS TWO
	SECTIONS.... STARDRIVE AND SAUCER MOVING APART.

					PICARD V.O.
			Ship's log, exact moment of
			separation, stardate 42354.22.

	As the Stardrive Section gets safely clear of the
	saucer, it begins turning, doubling back to face the
	"Q" menace. And now in the direction of that threat,
	we begin to see PHOTON EXPLOSIONS in the far, far
	distance.

42   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER

	On which we see a tiny but SOMEWHAT LARGER IMAGE OF THE
	HOSTILE VESSEL in front of which the last few PHOTON
	DETONATIONS HAPPEN AND FADE AWAY.

					TASHA
			All torpedoes have detonated, sir.

					PICARD
				(to Data)
			Reverse power and hold this
			position.

					DATA
				(gives a surprised look)
			Reverse power...decelerating.

					TROI
			That will bring them here in just
			minutes, sir.

					TASHA
			Will we make a fight of it,
			Captain? If we can at least
			damage their ship....

					PICARD
				(indicating viewer)
			Lieutenant... are you recommending
			we fight a life form that can do
			all those things?
				(as Tasha hesitates)
			I'd like to hear your advice.

					TASHA
			I... spoke before I thought, sir.
			We should look for some way to
			distract them from going after
			the saucer.

					DATA
			All forward motion stopped, sir.

					PICARD
				(to Troi)
			Commander, signal the following
			in all languages and on all
			frequencies: we surrender. State
			that we are not asking for any
			terms or conditions.

					TROI
			Aye, sir. All language forms and
			frequencies.

43   ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER

	Where the IMAGE OF THE HOSTILE is rapidly growing in
	size.

44   EXT. SPACE - U.S.S. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	As the HOSTILE IMAGE rushes down on the starship, THE
	COALESCENT SHAPE OPENING UP INTO SOMETHING LIKE THE
	SHIMMERING GRID WE'VE SEEN, but now as if to enclose
	(and perhaps crush) the starship. A FURY OF SOUNDS like
	CLANKING-SCREAMS OF METAL BEING STRESSED BEYOND ITS
	LIMITS.

45   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - VARIOUS ANGLES

	As the bridge and the entire Stardrive Section is SHAKEN
	ALMOST ANGRILY as the same CACOPHONY OF CLANKING-SCREAMS
	continues. All bridge crew cling to their seats until
	the SHAKING AND SOUNDS REACH A PEAK. As when "Q" first
	appeared, FLASHES OF LIGHT BLIND US and become:

46   INT. "Q" COURTROOM - EMPHASIZING PICARD, DATA, TROI, TASHA

	It is an immense courtroom meant to reflect strength
	and power. (We'll discover that it dates back to the
	mid-21st Century post-atomic crisis era.) Both decor
	and legal procedures reflect the time when a desperate
	humanity, still wounded and bleeding from nuclear war,
	sought answers to its pain and problems through the
	merciless strength of a new form of dictatorial
	government representing neither capitalism nor
	communism. Our four starship people are in old, ragged
	and stained uniforms which 'demean' them as criminals.
	In comparison with the gleaming steel and glass of the
	rest of the courtroom, the Prisoner's Dock at which our
	people sit is made of rough-hewn, hard and ugly wooden
	benches. Suddenly, our Starfleet group is CAUGHT IN
	A HARSH GLARING SPOTLIGHT. Data, looking around with
	great curiosity, is the first to speak:

					DATA
			Historically intriguing, Captain.
			Very, very accurate.

					PICARD
				(nods)
			Mid-21st Century, the post-atomic
			horror....

	Interrupted by the SOUND OF A BELL, and CUT TO:

47   ANGLE INCLUDING MANDARIN-BAILIFF

	Important, the MANDARIN-BAILIFF is not a fun figure.
	Despite the Asian robe and accent, he is an important
	authority figure--and his expression and actions
	underscore this. He caries a slim, portable view
	screen, the face of which contains scrolled information
	he will occasionally refer to. Now, as he nods to a
	Court Functionary who uses an ancient, oriental bell,
	DOLEFULLY CLANGING to gain attention.

					MANDARIN-BAILIFF
			All present, make respectful
			attention to honored Judge!

48   ANGLE EMPHASIZING SPECTATORS

	Some still arriving, chattering in excitement, having
	to be intimidated into silence by a 21st CENTURY SOLDIER,
	heavily armed. Picard waves in a way indicating Data, Tasha
	and Troi should not stand.

					TROI
				(quietly to Picard)
			Careful, sir. This is not an
			illusion or a dream.

					PICARD
			But these courts happened in our
			past....

					TROI
			I don't understand either, but
			this is real. I can feel that!

49   OTHER ANGLES AS NEEDED

	A 21st Century MILITARY OFFICER moving to our Starfleet
	group, leveling his automatic weapon toward them.

					FUTURE MILITARY OFFICER
			Get to your feet, criminals!

	Our people ignore him too. "Mandarin-Bailiff" is
	CLANGING THE BELL again. Data sees something,
	indicates:

					DATA
			At least we are acquainted with
			the judge, Captain.

50   ANGLE ON JUDGE

	The "judge's bench" (an appropriate 21st Century design
	on Chapman camera-crane) comes floating into the
	courtroom. Seated in it is "Q" (JUDGE), an arrangement
	which gives "his Honor" physical access to every part
	and corner of this courtroom. As he floats serenely
	over spectators' heads, suddenly there's the RATATATTAT
	of an automatic weapon.

51   ANGLE INCLUDING MILITARY OFFICER

	Just completing FIRING a warning burst at the feet of
	Picard.

					MILITARY OFFICER
				(screaming angrily)
			Attention! On your feet,
			attention!

	But Tasha pivoting in fast, taking the weapon and
	throwing the Officer crashing to the floor. Judge's
	"bench" (Camera Crane) brings "Q" INTO SCENE fast.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			You are out of order!

	But he's speaking to the downed military officer, not
	to Tasha. Which turns out to be a sentence of death
	-- carried out by a pair of Soldiers who step in,
	raising their automatic weapons, FIRING at the Officer
	lying on the floor. Spectators break into APPLAUSE as
	the Officer slumps and lies unmoving.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(continuing)
			The prisoners will not be
			harmed...
				(a glance at Picard)
			Until they are found guilty, of
			course.

	Still hovering over the fallen officer, "Q" indicates
	the body.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(continuing)
			Dispose of that.

	Picard has taken the automatic weapon from Tasha.

51   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Can we assume you mean this will
			be a fair trial?

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Yes, absolutely equitable.

	Picard hands the weapon to "Bailiff". "Q" (JUDGE)
	swings his "bench" to CENTER FRONT of the courtroom.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(continuing to
				 Mandarin-bailiff)
			Proceed.

					MANDARIN-BAILIFF
				(refers to his portable
				 viewscreen)
			Before this gracious court now
			appear these humans to answer for
			the multiple and grievous
			savageries of their species.

	Judge's "bench" swings "Q" (JUDGE) in literally
	nose-to-nose with Picard.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			How plead you, criminal?

					DATA
			If I may, Captain....
				(gets a nod)
			Objection, your honor. In the
			year 2016, the new United Nations
			declared that no Earth citizen
			could be made to answer for the
			crimes of their race or
			forbearers.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Objection denied!

	Followed by CLANGING OF BAILIFF'S BELL and CHEERS FROM
	THE SPECTATORS.

52   ANGLE EMPHASIZING "Q" AND PICARD

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(continuing)
			This is a court of the year 2049,
			by which time more 'rapid
			progress' had caused all 'United
			Earth' nonsense to be abolished.

52   CONTINUED:

	At which point Tasha comes to her feet very angry.

					PICARD
			Tasha, no...

					TASHA
			I must... 
				(to "Q")
			... because I grew up on a world
			that allowed things like this
			court. And it was people like
			these that saved me from it. I
			say that this so-called court
			should get down on its knees to
			what Starfleet is, what it
			represents... 

53   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	And "Q" (JUDGE) flies INTO SCENE, gesturing toward Tasha
	as he did earlier to Conn on the bridge... resulting in
	the same FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE THAT ENVELOPES
	HER. As Tasha goes rigid, frozen, Data supports her,
	lowers her form gently to the floor as:

					TROI
				(shouting to "Q")
			You barbarian! That girl....

	"Q" gestures and the same FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE
	ENVELOPS HER TOO. Picard leaps in, keeps her frozen,
	rigid form from crashing down.

					MANDARIN-BAILIFF
			Criminals keep silence!

54   ANGLE ON PICARD

	bending over Tasha, then to "Q":

					PICARD
			You've got a lot to learn about
			humans if you think you can
			torture us or frighten us into
			silence.
				(to Data)
			Are they still alive?

					DATA
			Uncertain. Lieutenant Graham was
			when our medics thawed him out.

54   CONTINUED:

	"Q" (JUDGE) glides in closer on his "bench".

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			You will answer the charges!

					PICARD
			Or what? Or this, or worse? Or
			death? I suggest you take a
			better look at human history.

	Spectators have begun GRUMBLING over Picard's failure
	to answer "Q".

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			You are charged, criminals. How
			plead you?

					PICARD
			Just a moment ago, you promised
			"the prisoners will not be
			harmed." We plead nothing so long
			as you break your own rules.

	LOUDER GRUMBLING from the Spectators now.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			I suggest you center your
			attention on the trial, Captain.
			It may be your only hope.

					PICARD
			And I suggest you now may be
			having second thoughts about this
			trial! You're considering that
			if you conduct it fairly, which
			was your promise, you may lose.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(laughs)
			Lose?

					PICARD
			Yes, even though you're judge, and
			prosecutor....

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(nods)
			And jury.

54   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
				(considers it; nods)
			Accepted... so long as you keep
			to your agreement.
				(indicates Troi and
				 Tasha)
			And assaulting prisoners is hardly
			a fair trial.

55   OPTICAL ANGLE ON "Q" (OPTICAL)

	Seems to be considering it. Then he looks downward,
	indicates.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			This is a merciful court.

	"Q" waves his hand DOWNWARD TO WARD TROI AND TASHA AND
	A RIPPLE OF LIGHT plays over the two women, UNFREEZING
	THEM.

	ANOTHER ANGLE "Q" (JUDGE)

	The court very disorderly now with some spectators
	standing on their benches SHOUTING as an annoyed "Q"
	brings his "bench" up hovering over the heads of
	everyone.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(greatly AMPLIFIED)
			SILENCE!

	The order is so LOUDLY AMPLIFIED that it comes near to
	shaking the entire courtroom structure. The spectators
	bite off their words and sink frightened into their
	seats. We notice "Q" throwing a glance toward Picard
	to see if the Captain is properly impressed. Then the
	"bench" is lowered to allow "Q" to face Picard again.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(continued)
			Continuing these proceedings, I
			must caution you that legal
			trickery is not permitted. This
			is a court of fact!

55   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(same words; same time)
			... court of fact!
				(nods)
			We humans know our past, even when
			we're ashamed of it. I recognize
			this court system as the one which
			agreed with Shakespeare's
			suggestion -- "Kill all the
			lawyers".

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(nods)
			Which humans did.

					PICARD
			Which led to the rule: "Guilty
			until proven innocent".

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Of course. Bringing the innocent
			to trial would be unfair.
				(leaning in; voice
				 amplified)
			YOU WILL NOW ANSWER TO THE
			GRIEVOUS SAVAGERY CHARGE AGAINST
			HUMANITY.

					PICARD
			We'll be happy to answer specific
			charges. "Grievous savagery" could
			mean anything.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(interrupting)
			Obviously it means causing harm
			to fellow creatures!

					PICARD
			Such as you did when you froze
			a member of our bridge crew? Will
			you be joining us in the dock
			here?

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			You fool. Are you certain you
			want a full disclosure of human
			ugliness?
				(to Mandarin-Bailiff)
			So be it! Present the charges.

	Mandarin-Bailiff refers to his portable view screen,
	then steps forward and presents it for Picard's
	examination.

55   CONTINUED: (2)

					MANDARIN-BAILIFF
			Criminal, you will read the
			charges to the court.

	Picard takes the parchment, glances through some amount
	of it. Then he looks up.

					PICARD
			I see no charges against us, your
			honor.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(pounds "bench top")
			Criminal, you are out of order!

	Soldiers move in, unslinging automatic weapons, of which
	the barrels of two of them are now placed against Troi's
	and Data's heads.

									FADE OUT.

                          PART THREE                            

	FADE IN:

56   INT. "Q" COURTROOM - WIDE ANGLE

	Action continuing from where it ended. The gun barrels
	are now pressing even closer to Troi and Data's heads
	as:

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Soldiers...
				(indicates guns)
			... you will press those triggers
			if this criminal answers with any
			word other than "guilty"...

57   CLOSER ANGLE

	The Soldiers CLICKING FIRING ACTION TO FULL COCK. "Q"
	turns to Picard.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Criminal, how plead you?

	Picard takes his time, looking to his people, the
	Soldiers holding the guns at their heads, then to "Q".
	He seems to be taking too much time, and one of them
	shifts his weight, the other begins grasping his weapon
	even more firmly. Then:

					PICARD
			Guilty...

	Picard's people can't help but show relief and even the
	soldiers lighten up their stance and their grip on the
	weapons, until:

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			... provisionally so.

	Surprised by this "add on", the Soldiers begin bringing
	their guns in close again, looking for guidance to "Q"
	who looks like he could decide either way. After
	considering it for a moment:

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			The Court will hear the provision.

57   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			We question whether this court
			is abiding by its own trial
			instructions. Do I have
			permission to have Commander Data
			repeat the record?

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			If this is legal trickery...

					PICARD
			Your own words, your Honor.
				(to Data)
			Exactly what followed his Honor's
			statement that the prisoner would
			not be harmed?

58   EMPHASIZING DATA

	Taking a moment to consult his memory, then:

					DATA
			Yes, sir. The Captain has asked
			the question...
				(in Picard's VOICE)
			"Can we assume this will be a fair
			trial?"
				(in Data VOICE)
			And in reply, the judge stated...

59   OTHER ANGLES

	as Data goes on.

					DATA
				(continuing in "Q"'s
				 VOICE)
			"Yes, absolutely equitable."

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Unacceptable testimony, entirely
			unacceptable... !

59   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			If your Honor pleases, there is
			a simple way to clear up this
			disagreement.
				(waits until he has
				 "Q"'s attention)
			We agree there is evidence to
			support the court's contention
			that humans have been murderous
			and dangerous.
				(moves in closer to "Q")
			I say "have been" ... and
			therefore we will respectfully
			submit to a test of whether this
			is presently true of humans.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(suddenly alert)
			I see, I see.
				(an idea forming)
			And you petition the Court to
			accept you and your comrades as
			proof of what humanity has become.

					PICARD
			There should be many ways we can
			be tested. We have a long mission
			ahead of us...

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Another brilliant suggestion,
			Captain. But your test hardly
			requires a 'long mission'.
				(laughs)
			Your immediate destination offers
			more challenge than you can
			possibly imagine. Yes, yes, this
			Farpoint station will be an
			excellent test of human worth.

	Picard, like the others, is now becoming just a bit
	concerned. What does lie ahead of them on Farpoint
	Station?

60   ANGLE INCLUDING MANDARIN-BAILIFF

	with "Q" nodding to him as the Bailiff stands, raising
	his voice.

					MANDARIN-BAILIFF
			Stand respectfully. All present,
			respectfully stand!

61   WIDE ANGLE

	Spectators standing. Picard and his people coming to
	their feet too.

62   EMPHASIZING "Q" AND PRISONERS (OPTICAL)

	as "Q" moves his bench into position.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			This trial is adjourned to allow
			the criminals to be tested.

	The Mandarin-bailiff LOUDLY CLANGS HIS BELL.

					MANDARIN-BAILIFF
			This honorable court is adjourned!

	There is a smile coming onto the face of "Q" as he turns
	to Picard.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Captain, you may find you are not
			nearly clever enough to deal with
			what lies ahead for you. It may
			have been better to accept
			sentence here.

	"Q" WAVES TOWARD THEM, PRODUCING THE BLINDING LIGHT
	EFFECT we've seen before -- and the EFFECT BECOMES:

63   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE

	Picard and the others now in their normal garb and at
	their regular stations, all beginning to register their
	realization of where they now are.

64   ANGLES EMPHASIZING DATA, TROI, AND TASHA

	Reacting to where they now find themselves. Data turns
	to the Ops position.

					DATA
			Uh... what is present course, Ops?

	The OPS OFFICER looks at Data, surprised.

					OPS
				(to Data)
			It's exactly what the Captain
			ordered, sir. Direct heading to
			Farpoint Station.

64   CONTINUED:

	Data has reviewed his console readings during this,
	turns to Picard:

					DATA
			Confirm we are on that heading,
			sir.

					OPS
				(to Data)
			Know anything about Farpoint?
			It sounds like a fairly dull
			place.

					PICARD
			Actually, Ops, I've heard just
			the opposite.

	Picard, Data, Troi and Tasha exchange looks, then settle
	back.

65   EXT. SPACE - LONG SHOT - PLANET (OPTICAL)

	moving in on a yellowish ball of a planet glowing
	against the black backdrop of starry space in the
	reflected light of its sun. There is some cloud layer.
	At this distance, the planet's land masses are vague
	and indistinct.

					RIKER'S VOICE
			Personal log, Commander William
			Riker, Star Date 42354.4, at
			Farpoint Station.

66   CLOSER - ON THE PLANETS AND THE USS HOOD (OPTICAL)

	An older class starship (the USS Hood) lies in
	geosynchronous orbit above the planet.

					RIKER'S VOICE
			... U.S.S. Hood has dropped me
			off at Farpoint Station where I
			await the arrival of the new
			U.S.S. Enterprise...

67   CLOSER - ON THE OLD CITY/STATION (SPEC.FX)

	AN AERIAL VIEW of the small, obviously old Bandi city
	connected to the modern sprawling spaceport/station,
	both set in the middle of a harsh and forbidding
	landscape. This is Farpoint Station. CAMERA PUSHES
	IN on the Old City portion.

67   CONTINUED:

					RIKER'S VOICE
			... to which I have been assigned
			as first officer. Meanwhile...

68   INT. OLD CITY CORRIDOR - PANNING RIKER

	Commander William T. Riker approaching the door leading
	to the office at Farpoint's Administrator.

					RIKER'S VOICE
			... I have been asked to visit
			the office of Farpoint Station's
			Administrator.

69   INT. ZORN'S OFFICE - OLD CITY - DAY - ANGLE ON RIKER AND ZORN 69

	Riker ENTERING, crossing to an elegant, unusually shaped
	desk where ZORN, the station Groppler (administrator)
	rises and (unused to handshaking) at first offers the
	wrong hand, then gets the procedure straightened out
	with MUMBLED APOLOGIES. As with all the Bandi, Zorn
	is tall, skinny, rather grey-looking -- appears to be
	sixtyish (as do all the Bandi, including the young
	ones.)

					ZORN
			I thought you might like to know,
			Commander Riker, that we've still
			no word from your vessel. But,
			I trust we have made your waiting
			comfortable?

					RIKER
			Luxurious is more like it. Would
			it seem ungrateful if I ask for
			some information?

					ZORN
			Anything!

					RIKER
			Fascinating how in the midst of
			an old city like this, you've
			built a completely modern
			tritanium and duraglass space
			station. Your energy supply must
			be as abundant as I've heard.

69   CONTINUED:

					ZORN
			Geothermal energy is the one great
			blessing of this planet. I'll
			have all the details of that sent
			to your quarters.

					RIKER
			Thank you. But it still seems
			incredible how you've built this
			station so rapidly and so... so
			perfectly suited to our needs.

	Pushes a desk top bowl of fruit toward Riker.

					ZORN
			Would your care for an Earth
			delicacy, Commander?

					RIKER
			Well, if there's an apple there...

	There isn't and we can SEE that this disappoints Zorn.

					RIKER
				(looking up; continues)
			It doesn't matter... what I was
			saying was...
				(sees something out of
				 SCENE)
			Well, I'll be damned!

70   CAMERA PANS RIKER

	as he steps to the far end of Zorn's desk where ANGLE
	REVEALS a second bowl of fruit. Riker picks an apple
	from it.

					ZORN
			Ah... ah yes, there was another
			selection here...

					RIKER
				(perplexed)
			Zorn, I would have sworn it wasn't
			here a moment ago.

					ZORN
			And does your failure to notice
			it make it unwelcome?
				(smiles)
			The same with Farpoint Station,
			Commander.
					(MORE)

70   CONTINUED:

					ZORN (Cont'd)
			We hope a few easily answered
			questions about it won't make
			Starfleet appreciate it less.

	Riker eyes Zorn thoughtfully, then takes a bite out of
	the apple. He chews, then:

					RIKER
			I'm sure it won't, sir.
				(raises apple up)
			And this is delicious. Thank you.
				(crossing to door)
			Good morning, Groppler Zorn.

	He is EXITING even as Zorn levers himself out of his
	own chair.

					ZORN
			Good morning.

	The door closes behind Riker, and Zorn turns around
	angrily.

					ZORN
				(continuing)
			You've been told not to do that.
			Why can't you understand? It will
			arouse their suspicions.

	As he speaks, CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL clearly that
	there is no one else in the room, nor does he appear
	to be speaking into any sort of communication device.
	He seems to be talking to the walls.

					ZORN
				(continuing)
			... and if that happens, we will
			have to punish you. We will, I
			promise you. We must!

	No reply that we can hear. Is this man mad?

									CUT TO:

71   INT. FARPOINT FOYER

	In considerable contrast to Zorn's old city office we
	just left, this structure has a "starbase" look with
	its dazzling tritanium and glass construction. The few
	people in sight are Starfleet personnel. ENTERING
	FOREGROUND are DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER and her
	fifteen-year-old son WESLEY.

71   CONTINUED:

	Like most other humans of this century, she doesn't look
	her age. Although forty years old, she looks hardly
	more than thirty. Her attractiveness is underscored
	by a naturally provocative walk -- the woman can't help
	it. This is counter-balanced by her quick intelligence
	and her professional knowledge and skill as a physician.
	Her son, Wes, has that same quick intelligence,
	multiplied by four. That lively brain is ensconced in
	the body of a perfectly normal boy with moderate good
	looks, a cheerful personality, but with considerable
	maturity for someone his age.

72   ANOTHER ANGLE

	Riker ENTERS SCENE behind them and hurries to catch up.
	He calls:

					RIKER
			Doctor Crusher...

					WESLEY
			Mother, it's Commander Riker.

	Beverly slows, lets Riker walk along with them. We see
	that despite her attractive face and form, she is
	naturally dignified and a bit reserved with new
	acquaintances like Riker.

					RIKER
			And hello to you, Wesley.
			Enjoying Farpoint Station?

					WESLEY
				(happily)
			Yes, sir.

	Riker smiles at the boy. It's clear he approves of this
	polite and likeable kid. Then he becomes aware that
	Beverly has not answered his greeting and is waiting.

					RIKER
			Saw you and thought I'd join your
			stroll, if I may.

					BEVERLY
			Actually, we're about to do some
			shopping.

	Riker throws her a look. Is she rejecting the offer
	of his company?

72   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			I've been meaning to visit the
			mall myself. If I'm welcome?

					BEVERLY
			Of course.

	She moves toward an exit door. Wes has been looking
	from one to the other of them, interested in what
	they've said... and not said.

73   INT. FARPOINT SHOPPING MALL - DAY

	The ANGLE suggests a covered, airy mall with flowers
	and trees -- many of them Earth types but with a
	scattering of alien vegetation too. It is a spacious
	walkway with a number of pleasant shops and booths.
	In b.g. we SEE Bandi natives of this world, a tall and
	greyish life form, quiet and overly polite. Beverly,
	Wesley and Riker move down a line of shops.

74   CLOSER - BEVERLY, WESLEY, RIKER

	as they walk, Wes continuing to eye the two adults.
	Then:

					WESLEY
			If you're wondering about Mom,
			Mister Riker, she's isn't actually
			unfriendly. She's just shy around
			men she doesn't know.

	Beverly is startled; Riker amused.

					BEVERLY
			Wesley... !
				(swallows her annoyance;
				 to Riker)
			I believe that means he would like
			us to be friends.

					RIKER
				(grins)
			I'm willing, Doctor.
				(more serious)
			And although we're not officially
			part of the Enterprise yet, I
			thought there might be something
			useful we could do while we wait.

74   CONTINUED:

	Beverly stops at a table in front of a shop selling
	exotic materials. The modest selections of cloth are
	lined up on the table, some draped for best effect.
	Beverly looks over them critically, feeling weight and
	texture. The Bandi SHOPKEEPER has stayed at the rear
	of the booth.

					BEVERLY
			"Useful"? How and what,
			Commander?

					RIKER
			Investigating some things I've
			noticed here, Doctor. The last
			was a piece of fruit...

	Beverly has frowned over a particularly pretty piece
	of material which she holds up for the shopkeeper to
	see.

					BEVERLY
			Would this be available in emerald
			green?

	The Bandi Merchant smiles, nods and takes the bolt of
	cloth INTO A SMALL CLOSED OFF AREA BEHIND. Wes watches
	the merchant go as Beverly turns to look at Riker
	appraisingly.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			I'm sure, Commander, there are
			reasons for a first officer to
			want to demonstrate his energy
			and alertness to a new captain.
			But since my duty and interests
			are outside the command
			structure...

	The Bandi Merchant comes quickly with the bolt of cloth
	-- now emerald green -- interrupts Beverly by holding
	it up for her approval.

					RIKER
			Isn't it nice he happened to have
			the right color?

	Beverly glances sharply at Riker, suppressing a somewhat
	chagrined look.

74   CONTINUED: (2)

					BEVERLY
				(to Merchant)
			Thank you. I'll take the entire
			bolt. Charge it to Beverly
			Crusher, Chief Medical Officer,
			USS Enterprise.

	The Merchant nods, ticks the information off on a flat
	little gadget that dangles from his belt, hands her the
	bolt of cloth.

75   ANOTHER ANGLE - DOLLYING WITH BEVERLY, RIKER, WESLEY

	as they walk away, Riker enjoying the look that's come
	onto her face over this incident.

					RIKER
			Let's see, where were we?

					BEVERLY
			I was accusing you of inventing
			work in order to curry favor with
			your new captain. I apologize.

					WESLEY
			Finding the exact right color took
			him only about twelve seconds,
			Mom.

	They stop a little distance off and look back toward
	the shop.

					BEVERLY
			Maybe this is something Jean-Luc
			Picard will want looked into.

					RIKER
			Jean-Luc? You know Captain
			Picard?

					WESLEY
				(proudly)
			When I was little, he brought my
			father's body home to us.

	Riker is startled but Beverly only smiles, fondly pats
	her son's head.

75   CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			Yes, Wes, long, long ago.
				(to Riker)
			Shall we continue the walk? I'd
			like to know you better, Mister
			Riker.

									CUT TO:

76   INT. FARPOINT LOUNGE - DAY - ON GEORDI AND MARKHAM

	LT. GEORDI LaFORGE and ENSIGN SAWYER MARKHAM are in the
	small, comfortable lounge area. Markham is a likeable
	young man, enthusiastic, energetic. He is still
	inclined to shoot from the hip rather than consider
	before speaking, but he is a capable (and very new)
	graduate of the Academy. We SEE Geordi at first only
	from behind, and we may routinely register the fact he
	is black.

					MARKHAM
			Where is she? They say she's
			never late -- not since the old
			burrhog took over the captain's
			chair.

					RIKER'S VOICE
			You wouldn't be talking about the
			Enterprise, would you, Ensign
			Markham?

77   WIDER ANGLE

	The two young men turn around sharply to find Riker has
	come up behind them. The most important thing we notice
	about Geordi is that he wears a strange flattish device
	(like futuristic goggles) over his eyes. Although he
	is technically blind, his head always turns toward the
	person speaking to him because he can, in fact, see as
	well or better than anyone through the use of the visual
	prosthesis. As they realize that Riker is a senior
	officer, both young men straighten to attention.

					GEORDI/MARKHAM
			Sir. Yes, sir.

	Riker smiles at the ingrained and traditional response
	of the recent Academy graduate.

					RIKER
			You can stand at ease, gentlemen.
			We're not on the Enterprise yet.

77   CONTINUED:

					MARKHAM
			You know we're assigned to her,
			sir.

					RIKER
				(extending his hand)
			Riker. I'm slated to be First
			Officer.
				(they shake hands)
			I read the service records on all
			new personnel on the trip out.
			Excellent academic record at
			Starfleet Academy, Mister Markham.

					MARKHAM
			Thank you, sir.

					RIKER
			And you, Mister LaForge. Captain
			Dreyer praised your performance
			on the Hood. Why did you request
			transfer to the Enterprise?

					GEORDI
			Who wouldn't, sir? The biggest,
			newest, fastest starship in the
			fleet --

					RIKER
			Commanded by the best burrhog in
			the fleet. Right, Mister Markham?

					MARKHAM
				(sheepishly)
			Yes, sir.

					RIKER
				(grins)
			I've already forgotten who used
			those words.

					GEORDI
			Shouldn't we have heard something
			from her by now, sir?

	A BANDI WOMAN approaches:

					BANDI WOMAN
			Commander Riker?

					RIKER
			Yes?

77   CONTINUED: (2)

					BANDI WOMAN
			The Enterprise has been picked
			up on our monitors, sir. I should
			tell you, sir, it is only the
			Stardrive Section.

	All three crewman are surprised to hear this.

					RIKER
				(to Woman)
			What about the Saucer Module?

					BANDI WOMAN
			We've received no explanation,
			sir. But the captain signals that
			you're to beam up immediately.

					GEORDI
				(to Markham)
			Our new captain doesn't waste
			time.

					RIKER
			A good rule for all of us to
			follow, gentlemen.

	Riker touches his communicator. His VOICE now 'treated'
	to indicate he is transmitting. (This will be standard
	communicator format.)

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Enterprise, this is Commander
			Riker on Farpoint. Standing by
			to beam up.

	TRANSPORTER EFFECT (OPTICAL)

									FADE OUT.

                           PART FOUR                            

	FADE IN:

78   EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Enterprise stardrive module in orbit of the Farpoint
	planet.

0    INT. STARDRIVE TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON PLATFORM (OPTICCAL)

	As Riker BEAMS IN. Lieutenant Tasha Yar of Security
	is there, waiting until Riker is fully materialized,
	then:

					TASHA
			Lieutenant Yar of Security, sir.
			Captain Picard will see you on
			the Battle Bridge.

	Riker was prepared to shake hands but Tasha is already
	leading the way toward the turbolift.

80   INT. TURBOLIFT

	As Riker follows her inside, she speaks quietly toward
	the controls:

					TASHA
			Battle bridge.

	The doors snap closed and the lift moves. Riker looks
	Tasha over, waiting, then:

					RIKER
			With the saucer gone, can I assume
			something interesting happened
			on your way here?

					TASHA
			I'll let the captain explain, sir.

81   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD

	He is seated in the command chair with Data and
	a couple of other crewpersons at their stations.

					DATA
			We are cleared into the standard
			parking orbit, sir.

81   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(nods)
			Make it so.

	The bridge turbolift doors open, Riker ENTERS the bridge
	after Tasha, follows her to Picard.

					TASHA
			Commander Riker, sir.

					RIKER
			Riker, W.T., reporting as ordered,
			sir.

	Picard takes his time, looking Riker over and then
	offering his hand.

					PICARD
			I really didn't expect to welcome
			you to half a starship, Riker.
				(to Tasha)
			Is the viewer ready?

					TASHA
			All set up, sir.

					PICARD
				(to Riker)
			We'll first bring you up to date
			on a little... "adventure" we had
			on our way here, Commander. Then
			we'll talk.

					TASHA
				(to Riker)
			This way, sir.

	True, Picard does not waste time. Tasha is already
	leading Riker toward a viewer at the aft section of the
	Battle Bridge.

82   ANGLE ON AFT VIEWER

	as Tasha motions Riker to the seat, turns the VIEWER
	ON. The VIEWER SHOWS A SHOT FROM EARLIER WHEN "Q"
	(ELIZABETHAN) HAD APPEARED AND IS TALKING TO Picard.
	The VOICES ARE FAINT and Riker leans in, riveting
	attention to the bridge record.

83   ANGLE ON PICARD AND DATA

	as the android officer turns toward the captain.

83   CONTINUED:

					DATA
				(interrupting)
			Message from the Saucer Module.
			It will arrive here in fifty-one
			minutes, sir.

					PICARD
			Inform them we'll hook up as soon
			as they arrive.

	Picard stands, crosses past Tasha on his way to the
	turbolift.

					PICARD
				(to Tasha)
			Bring him to my Ready Room when
			he's done there.

	Picard EXITS via turbolift.

84   ANGLE ON RIKER

	Where VIEWER SHOWS ANGLE ON THE "Q" GRIDWORK STRETCHES
	OVER THE HEAVENS, THEN SHOT OF "Q" (21st CENTURY).
	Riker TURNS AWAY FROM VIEWER TOWARD CAMERA as he looks
	at the crewpersons on the bridge. He speaks to no one
	in particular.

					RIKER
			He calls that "a little
			adventure"?

85   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE READY ROOM

	Picard at a viewer going over a rather complex screen
	of formulas. A KNOCK at the door, he turns the viewer
	off.

					PICARD
			Come.

	Riker ENTERS, crosses to where the captain indicates
	he's to sit. He does so, looking at Picard. Then:

					RIKER
			Wow!

					PICARD
				(laughs, nods)
			Exactly.

85   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			This "Q", sir... is he crazy?
			I mean, seriously?

					PICARD
			Seriously, does it really matter
			how we judge them? We're dealing
			with something that can juggle
			starships as if they were pebbles.

					RIKER
			It's a rather astonishing "little
			adventure" you've had, Captain.

					PICARD
				(snaps)
			The issue isn't what we call it,
			Commander. The important thing
			is we can be dead certain...
			accent on dead... that "Q" wasn't
			joking. We're alive only because
			we were placed on "probation",
			a very serious kind of
			"probation".

	Over which we have heard a CHIME SOUND.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Go.

					DATA'S VOICE
			The Saucer Module is now entering
			orbit with us, sir.

					PICARD
			Acknowledged. Commander Riker will
			conduct a manual docking. Picard
			out.

					RIKER
			Sir?

					PICARD
			You've reported in, haven't you?
			You are qualified?

					RIKER
			Yes, sir.

					PICARD
			Then I meant now, Mister Riker.

	Riker jumps to his feet, EXITS. CAMERA PANS to Picard
	whose expression now relaxes. He's not too unhappy with
	what he's seen of his new first officer so far.

86   EXT. SPACE - SAUCER SECTION, BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL)

	As before, the Saucer Section is above and ahead of the
	battle section. The battle section is SLOWLY moving
	ahead toward the Saucer Section for link-up.

87   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - FULL SHOT

	Riker at the conn, concentrating. Tasha and Data are
	studying him, privately evaluating this new man.

					DATA
			You say you will be doing this
			manually, sir? No automation?

					RIKER
			As ordered.

88   EMPHASIZING RIKER

	He's making a couple of calculations, glancing up at
	the viewscreen.

89   ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	The rear end of the saucer is moving closer, but it is
	still high.

90   EMPHASIZING RIKER

					RIKER
				(to Data at Conn)
			Two percent rise. Up angle
			adjustment three degrees.
			Maintain docking speed.

	Ops and conn positions AD LIB repeats of Riker's orders.

91   EXT. SPACE - SAUCER AND BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL)

	The battle section is seen rising, angling forward
	slightly, still moving slowly toward the saucer.

92   INT. BATTLE BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING RIKER

	glancing at the O.S. viewscreen, works his console
	again.

					RIKER
			Level her out. Maintain docking
			speed. Docking crew, prepare for
			reconnection.

93   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON SAUCER AND BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL)

	The two are level now, quite close together, the battle
	section still moving slowly forward.

94   INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE ON RIKER

	Riker looks up at the viewscreen again.

95   ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	The saucer looms in the viewscreen -- everything is
	level, the docking section is dead ahead -- we are still
	moving forward.

96   CLOSE ON RIKER

	He makes a couple of quick entries on his console.

					RIKER
			All stop. Her inertia should do
			the job now.

97   EXT. SPACE - SAUCER AND BATTLE SECTION (OPTICAL)

	The two glide together smoothly.

98   INT. BRIDGE - WIDE SHOT

	Riker hits a couple more tabs on his panel as:

					RIKER
			Rejoin lock-up... now.

99   EXT. SPACE - FINAL HOOK-UP (OPTICAL)

	The reverse of disconnecting SHOTS we saw earlier --
	huge STARDRIVE SECTION and SAUCER MODULE MECHANISMS
	MAKING FINAL HOOK-UP.

100  EXT. ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)

	The docking complete.

101  INT. TURBOLIFT

	Riker with Data, Tasha, and others. The time this takes
	is indicative of the size of this new Enterprise.

101  CONTINUED:

					RIKER (V.O.)
			Enterprise log, First Officer
			entry. Ship's modules rejoined,
			stardate 42354.71 with command
			now transferred back to the main
			bridge.

	Riker looks up to see Tasha is watching him. Then:

					TASHA
			Neatly done, sir.

					RIKER
			I don't imagine many mistakes
			happen under Captain Picard.

					TASHA
			No sir, they don't.

102  INT. BRIDGE

	As the turbolift arrives. Lt. Worf crosses toward it,
	intercepts Riker.

					WORF
			I'm Lieutenant Worf, sir. Captain
			Picard requests you come
			immediately to his quarters.

	Having had little more than a glance at this main
	bridge, Riker turns and re-enters the turbolift.

103  INT. PICARD'S CABIN

	Much larger and more comfortable than the small battle
	Ready Room we were in earlier. Picard is there, turning
	as he hears a KNOCK:

					PICARD
			Come!

	Riker ENTERS.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			A fairly routine maneuver but you
			handled it quite well.

					RIKER
			Thank you, sir. I hope I show
			some promise.

103  CONTINUED:

	An exchange of looks between the two. Clearly, Riker
	is annoyed by this "faint praise" kind of welcome.
	Picard leads the way to a setting for coffee.

					PICARD
			Some coffee.

					RIKER
			No thank you, sir.

					PICARD
				(pours himself a cup)
			And now I have a kind of "what
			sort of second-in-command have
			I inherited?" question.

					RIKER
			Yes sir, I thought you might.

	There's nothing disrespectful in Riker's tone of voice,
	but he does leave an impression that he's not to be
	walked on either.

					PICARD
			I noticed in your envelope that
			Captain DeSoto thinks very highly
			of you. One curious thing,
			however, you refused to let him
			beam down to Altair IV?

					RIKER
			In my opinion, sir, Altair IV was
			too dangerous to risk exposing
			the captain.

					PICARD
			I see. A captain's rank means
			nothing to you.

					RIKER
			Rather the reverse, sir. A
			captain's life means a great deal
			to me.

					PICARD
			Let me postulate something here,
			Mister Riker. Isn't it just possible
			that you don't get to be a
			starship captain without knowing
			when it's safe to beam down or
			not? Isn't it a little
			presumptuous for a first officer
			to second guess his captain's
			judgment?

103  CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
			Permission to speak candidly, sir?

					PICARD
			Always.

					RIKER
			You've been a first officer
			yourself. You know that assuming
			that responsibility must, by
			definition, include the safety
			of the captain. I have no problem
			with following the rules you lay
			down. But under no circumstances
			will I compromise your safety.
			If you have a problem with that,
			sir, you can put me back on the
			Hood before she leaves.

					PICARD
			You don't intend to back off that
			position?

					RIKER
			No, sir, I can't.

	Picard takes another beat to study him carefully, then:

					PICARD
			One further thing... a special
			favor I have to ask of you.

					RIKER
			Anything, sir.

					PICARD
			Using the same kind of strength
			you showed with Captain DeSoto,
			I'd appreciate it if you can keep
			me from making an ass of myself
			with children.

					RIKER
			Sir?

					PICARD
			I'm not a family man, Riker, and
			yet, Starfleet has given me a ship
			with children aboard.

					RIKER
				(nods)
			Yes, sir. And families...

103  CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD
			And I don't feel comfortable with
			children. But, since a captain
			needs an image of "geniality"
			toward the little monsters, you're
			to see that's exactly what I
			project.

					RIKER
			Aye, sir.

	For the first time, Picard smiles, extending his hand.
	We see he's surprisingly warm when he wants to be.
	Riker takes Picard's hand for a firm and friendly
	handshake.

					PICARD
			Welcome to the Enterprise, Mister
			Riker.

104  INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE

	as Riker steps out of the turbolift. He stops, takes
	in the size of his compared to the Battle Bridge. The
	Klingon Lieutenant is at the conn position. He turns,
	seeing Riker:

					WORF
			Yes sir, Commander?

	Riker crosses in, shakes hands.

					RIKER
			Thank you, Lieutenant. Is
			Commander Data on duty?

					WORF
			Commander Data is on a special
			assignment, sir. He's using our
			shuttlecraft to transfer an
			admiral over to the Hood.

					RIKER
			An admiral?

					WORF
			He's been aboard all day, sir,
			checking over medical layout.

					RIKER
			Why the shuttlecraft? Can he just
			beam over?

104  CONTINUED:

					WORF
			I suppose he could, sir. But the
			admiral's a rather remarkable man.

105  INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - ANGLE AT INTERSECTION

					DATA'S VOICE
			But, sir, the transporter could
			have you on the Hood in a matter
			of seconds, Admiral.

	Data and the admiral ENTER SCENE at the intersection.
	The admiral is very old with an almost transparent look.

					ADMIRAL
			Have you got some reason to want
			my atoms scattered all over space?

					DATA
			No sir. But at your age, sir,
			I thought you shouldn't have to
			put up with the time and trouble
			of a shuttlecraft.

	The admiral stops. Facing Data, he draws himself. up
	as straight as he can. His voice is crotchety and
	trembly -- and fiercely stubborn.

					ADMIRAL
			My age? Hold it right there, boy,
			what about my age?

					DATA
			Sorry, sir. If that subject
			troubles you...

					ADMIRAL
			Troubles me? What's so damned
			troubling about not having died?
			How old do you think I am?

					DATA
			One hundred forty-seven years,
			Admiral. According to Starfleet
			records.

					ADMIRAL
			Explain how you remember that so
			exactly.

					DATA
			I remember every fact I am exposed
			to, sir.

105  CONTINUED:

	The admiral peers at him closely, scowling.

					ADMIRAL
			I don't see any points on your
			ears, boy, but you sound like a
			Vulcan.

					DATA
			No, sir. I am an android.

					ADMIRAL
				(snorts)
			Almost as bad.

					DATA
				(at a loss, but still
				 respectful)
			I thought it was generally
			accepted, sir, that Vulcans are
			an advanced and most honorable
			race.

	The admiral stares at him a moment, his severe blue eyes
	gentling and his feisty scowl fading. He pats Data's
	sleeve and nods slightly.

					ADMIRAL
			They are, boy. They are. And
			also damned annoying at times.

					DATA
			Yes, sir.

	As they move away, Data gently assisting the old man:

					ADMIRAL
			This is a new ship, boy, but she's
			got the right name. Remember
			that.

					DATA
			I will, sir.

					ADMIRAL
			You treat her like a lady.
				(beat, quietly)
			She'll always bring you home...
									FADE OUT.

                           PART FIVE                            

	FADE IN:

106  EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	Both the Enterprise and the Hood in orbit close
	together. CAMERA ANGLE shows how much LARGER the
	Enterprise is.

107  INT. SICKBAY

	Beverly is wearing medical "blue" -- or whatever color
	Science personnel are going to be assigned. She steps
	toward a LARGE VIEWSCREEN which comes on, showing
	readouts indicative of the status of the ship's medical
	facilities.

					BEVERLY
			Show me the results of Captain
			Picard's most recent physical
			examination.

	The screen promptly BEGINS TO FLASH UP PRINTED
	INFORMATION, followed by X-Ray type shots, etc. Beverly
	studies it for awhile.

					PICARD'S VOICE
			Already at work, Doctor?

108  ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Beverly turns to find Captain Picard ENTERING. She
	nods in answer to his question.

					BEVERLY
			Yes, on a subject that's very
			important to this mission,
			Captain.
				(unhurriedly to
				 computer)
			Screen off.

	The screen GOES DARK.

					PICARD
			I wanted to say "welcome aboard."

109  CLOSER ANGLE - BEVERLY AND PICARD

	As if they're appraising each other, then:

109  CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			Thank you, Captain.

					PICARD
			And I thought I should talk to
			you very personally about your
			assignment here.

110  CLOSER TWO SHOT

	As Beverly nods, waits for him to continue.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			I wanted you to know I protested
			your posting to the Enterprise.

					BEVERLY
			Oh? Do you consider me
			unqualified?

					PICARD
			Hardly. Your service record shows
			you exactly the kind of CMO I'd
			want.

					BEVERLY
			Then you must object to me
			personally. Has it to do with
			our last meeting?

					PICARD
			I'm trying to be considerate of
			your feelings, Doctor Crusher.
			For you to serve with a commanding
			officer who would continually
			remind you of such a terrible
			personal tragedy...

					BEVERLY
				(annoyed; snaps)
			If I had any objections to serving
			with you, I wouldn't have
			requested this assignment,
			Captain.

					PICARD
			You requested this posting?

	He turns to exit. Beverly stirs, and her next words
	stop him.

110  CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			Captain. My feelings about my
			husband's death will have no
			effect on the way I serve you,
			this vessel, or this mission.

	Picard gives it a moment's thought, extends his hand.

					PICARD
			Then, welcome aboard, Doctor.
			I'm pleased to have you here.

	Beverly allows only a perfunctory handshake.

					BEVERLY
			Thank you. And now, if I can
			return to my duties...

	It is clear that Picard wanted to say more but she has
	neatly blocked any further conversation.

					PICARD
				(uncomfortably)
			Well... as I said, "welcome
			Aboard".

	She doesn't respond further and he has no choice but
	to turn and exit.

111  EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND HOOD IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)

	Again, EMPHASIZING the considerable difference in the
	sizes of the two starships as we SEE that the USS Hood
	is PULLING AWAY, LEAVING ORBIT.

112  INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE ON RIKER

	He is standing before the huge viewscreen. Behind him
	is the young Klingon, Worf, at the conn position with
	the rest of the bridge stations only nominally manned.
	Set in geosynchronous orbit over the planet, the
	Enterprise requires minimal monitoring at this time.

113  ANGLE ON TURBOLIFT DOORS

	They OPEN, and Picard steps out onto the bridge.

					PICARD
			Have you signaled the Hood, Mister
			Riker?

113  CONTINUED:

					RIKER
				(nods)
			Your exact message.
				(in French)
			Bon voyage mon amie. Aye, sir.

114  ANOTHER ANGLE - TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER

	as Picard smiles and steps toward it.

					PICARD
			And what was my answer, computer?

	MAIN VIEWER FLICKERS, then startles us with an ugly
	FLASH OF LIGHT that becomes an IMAGE OF "Q" (JUDGE)
	who is in LIMBO, but looking directly at Picard. His
	VOICE BOOMS LOUDLY, annoyed in tone:

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT PATIENTLY
			THROUGH ALL THIS NONSENSE? OR
			DID YOU THINK I WAS GONE?

	Picard is as startled as Riker. The young Klingon,
	Worf, comes tumbling out of the conn position, drawing
	his phaser and placing himself protectively between
	Picard and the threatening "Q" image.

					PICARD
			Do you intend to blast a hole
			through the viewer, Lieutenant?

	Worf apologetically puts his phaser away, lets Picard
	wave him aside.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			If the purpose of this is to test
			human worth, your honor, you must
			let us proceed in a normal human
			way.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			YOU ARE DILATORY! YOU HAVE
			TWENTY-FOUR HOURS! ANY FURTHER
			DELAY AND YOU RISK SUMMARY
			JUDGEMENT AGAINST YOU, CAPTAIN.

	A FLASH OF LIGHT and the main viewer returns to an image
	of the planet below.

115  ANOTHER ANGLE

					WORF
			Sorry, sir...

					RIKER
			No criticism. You reacted fast...

					PICARD
			... but in a completely useless
			way.

					WORF
			I'll learn to do better, sir.

					PICARD
			Of course you will. We've a long
			voyage ahead of us.

	Picard dismisses Worf with a flicker of a smile which
	takes the sting out of what he just said.

					RIKER
				(lowers voice)
			Hope you're right, sir. About
			the long voyage ahead.

	Picard looks to main viewer as if checking that "Q" is
	truly gone.

					PICARD
			I hope so too.

					RIKER
			What do we do, sir? With them
			monitoring every move, every
			word...

					PICARD
			S.O.P., Mister Riker.

					RIKER
			Standard Operating Procedures?

					PICARD
				(nods)
			We do exactly what we'd do if this
			"Q" never existed. If we're going
			to be damned, let's be damned for
			what we really are.

	Riker is suddenly very pleased with this captain. He
	nods emphatically.

									FADE OUT.

                           PART SIX                             

	FADE IN:

116  EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	U.S.S. Enterprise in orbit of planet Cygnus IV.

					PICARD V.O.
			Captain's log, stardate 42372.5.
			Of the twenty-four hours "Q"
			allotted us to prove ourselves...

117  INT. BRIDGE - ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER

	Minimum bridge crew on duty.

					PICARD V.O.
			... eleven have now passed without
			incident. And yet I cannot forget
			"Q's" prediction that we will face
			here some critical test of human
			worth.

118  INT. BRIDGE READY ROOM

	Picard and Riker comparing notes.

					RIKER
			This planet's interior heat
			results in abundant geothermal
			energy, sir. But it's about all
			this world does offer.

					PICARD
			And it's your belief that this
			is what made it possible for them
			to construct this base to
			Starfleet standards?

					RIKER
			Yes sir. We have to assume that
			they've been trading their surplus
			energy for the construction
			materials used here. According
			to our ship's scans, many of the
			materials used are not found on
			this world.

118  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(smiles)
			Perhaps it's like those incidents
			you describe in your report as
			"almost magical" attempts to
			please us.

					RIKER
			Those events did happen, sir.

					PICARD
			And in time we'll discover the
			explanation. Meanwhile, none of
			it suggests anything threatening.
			If only every life form had as
			much desire to please Starfleet.
				(stands)
			Ready to beam down? I'm looking
			forward to meeting this Groppler
			Zorn.

	Picard is leading Riker to the cabin door.

					RIKER
			I'm convinced there's more to it
			than just "pleasing us", sir.

					PICARD
				(as they exit)
			Like something "Q" is doing to
			trick us?

119  INT. BRIDGE

	As Picard and Riker enter from the adjoining Ready Room.
	Troi is just arriving in the turbolift and Picard calls
	to her.

					PICARD
			Over here, Counselor!
				(to Riker)
			I've asked her to join us in this
			meeting.
				(indicating)
			May I introduce our new first
			officer, Commander William Riker.
			Mister Riker, our ship's
			counselor, Deanna Troi.

120  TWO SHOT - RIKER AND TROI

	He's obviously stunned to find her here, although she
	isn't at all surprised.

					TROI'S VOICE
				(carrying her thoughts)
			Do you remember what I taught you,
			Izmadi? Can you still sense my
			thoughts?

	Then, she holds out her hand formally.

					TROI
			A pleasure, Commander.

					RIKER
				(nervously)
			I, ah... likewise, Counselor.

121  ANGLE INCLUDING PICARD

	Studying the two of them with some curiosity now.

					PICARD
				(to Riker)
			Have the two of you met before?

					RIKER
			We... we have, sir.

					PICARD
			Excellent. I consider it
			important that my key officers
			know each other's abilities.

					TROI
			We do, sir; we do.

	Meanwhile, Picard has indicated the turbolift and is
	leading them toward it.

122  EMPHASIZING TROI

	As she looks back toward Riker serenely.

					TROI'S VOICE
				(her thoughts)
			I, too, would never say goodbye,
			Izmadi.

123  EXT. FARPOINT STATION (OPTICAL)

	ESTABLISHING SHOT as:

					PICARD'S VOICE
			My crew and I need a bit more
			information...

124  INT. ZORN'S OFFICE

	Where Zorn sits behind his desk, his posture and
	attitude indicating some nervousness. Seated facing
	him are Picard, Riker, and Troi. We see that Zorn's
	attention is on Troi.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			... before we make our
			recommendations to Starfleet.

					ZORN
			No objections to that, but...
				(eyeing Troi again)
			... but I'm puzzled over your
			bringing a Betazoid to this. If
			her purpose here is to probe my
			thoughts, sir...

					TROI
			I can sense only strong emotions,
			Groppler. I am only half Betazoid;
			my father was a Starfleet officer.

					ZORN
			I have nothing to hide, of course.

					PICARD
			Good, since we admire what we've
			seen of your construction
			techniques. Starfleet may be
			interested in your constructing
			starbases elsewhere too.

125  ANGLE EMPHASIZING TROI

	As her expression begins to indicate an awareness of
	something distressing, something painful. During which:

					ZORN
			Unfortunately, Captain, we are
			not interested in building other
			facilities.

126  ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER

	This stumps Picard for a moment, during which:

					RIKER
			If I may, Captain...
				(gets a nod)
			Then a trade, Groppler? Some
			things you need in return for the
			loan of architects and engineers
			who can demonstrate your
			techniques.

127  EMPHASIZING ZORN

					ZORN
			We Bandi do not wish to leave our
			home world. If Starfleet cannot
			accept that small weakness, then
			we will be forced, unhappily, to
			seek an alliance with someone like
			the Ferengi, or...

	Zorn interrupted by a small GROAN coming from Troi.
	Her eyes are now closed over a strong distress she's
	sensing.

128  VARIOUS OTHER ANGLES

	As appropriate.

					PICARD
			Counselor... ? What is it?

					TROI
				(glancing toward Zorn)
			Do you want it described here,
			sir?

					PICARD
			Yes! No secrets here if we're
			all to be friends.
				(to Zorn)
			Agreed, Groppler?

					ZORN
			We ourselves have nothing to hide,
			but...

128  CONTINUED:

					TROI
				(another GROAN,
				 grimacing)
			Pain... pain, loneliness, terrible
			loneliness, despair...
				(indicates Zorn)
			I'm not sensing him, sir. Or any
			of his people... but it's
			something very close to this location.

					PICARD
				(to Zorn, demandingly)
			The source of this? Do you have
			any idea?

					ZORN
			No!
				(stands)
			No, absolutely not. And I find
			nothing helpful or productive in
			any of this!

					PICARD
				(stands, to Zorn)
			That's it? No other comment?

					ZORN
			What do you expect form us? We
			offer a base designed to your
			needs, luxurious even by human
			standards...

	Riker and Troi come to their feet too as Picard
	interrupts.

					PICARD
			... while refusing to answer even
			our simplest questions about it.
				(to Riker)
			We'll adjourn for now...
				(to Zorn)
			... while we all reconsider our
			positions.

	The three CROSS toward the exit.

					ZORN
			Captain, the Ferengi would be very
			interested in a base like this.

					PICARD
			Fine. I hope they find you as
			tasty as their other past
			associates.

	Picard and his people EXIT.

129  EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The U.S.S. Enterprise still in orbit over Cygnus IV.

130  INT. HOLODECK CORRIDOR

	Riker moving as if seeking someone. He intercepts a
	YOUNG ENSIGN who is passing and the junior officer sees
	Riker's emblem of rank and snaps to attention.

					RIKER
			Ensign, can you help me find
			Commander Data? I was told he's
			somewhere on this deck.

					YOUNG ENSIGN
			This way, sir.

131  ANGLE AT CORRIDOR WALL

	As the Ensign steps to a black surface of the corridor
	wall.

					YOUNG ENSIGN
			You must be new to these galaxy
			class starships, sir.
				(puts hand on the black
				 surface, saying)
			Tell me the location of Commander
			Data.

	At the touch and the words "Tell me" the black surface
	comes alive with light patterns showing appropriate
	information.

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Lieutenant Commander Data... now
			located in Holodeck area 4-J.

					YOUNG ENSIGN
				(indicating readout)
			And as you see, sir, it's pointing
			you that way.

					RIKER
			Go that way? How far?

					YOUNG ENSIGN
				(smiles)
			You'll know, sir.

	Riker AD LIBS a thanks, goes in the indicated direction.

132  PANNING RIKER

	Moving off in the indicated direction. Then the black
	surface there comes alive with a FLASHING DIRECTION
	SIGNAL.

					COMPUTER VOICE
			This way, please. The next
			hatchway on your right.

					RIKER
				(responding
				 automatically)
			Thank you...

					COMPUTER VOICE
			You're more than welcome,
			Commander Riker.

	Which startles him a bit but he walks on and turns right
	at a sophisticated looking Holodeck Hatchway.

133  EXT. PARKLAND

	The Parkland hidden at this moment by a WILD SECTION
	OF CORRIDOR WALL AND HATCHWAY which, when the hatch is
	opened, will REVEAL PARKLAND.

					COMPUTER VOICE
				(continuing without
				 delay)
			And if you care to enter,
			Commander...

					RIKER
				(snaps; interrupting)
			I do.

	Immediately, the hatch slides open and we SEE THE
	PARKLAND (LOCATION). It looks (and is) real, including
	land contours, trees, and even a small stream nearby.
	Beyond that the Parkland stretches off for what appears
	to be miles and miles away to the horizon.

134  ANGLE BACK TOWARD HATCHWAY

	As Riker ENTERS through it and stands inspecting the
	Parkland scene with genuine appreciation and then HEARS
	SOMEONE WHISTLING A MELODY, but doing it rather badly
	and laboriously.

135  ANGLE PAST RIKER INTO PARKLAND

	As he MOVES AWAY, seeking the source of the WHISTLING
	which will begin to grow LOUDER now.

136  ANGLE AT STREAM

	As Riker crosses, stepping from rock to rock. He makes
	a misstep, almost falls, then recovers and gets across.
	He looks back at the stone which caused it.

137  CLOSER ON RIKER

	As he walks, the WHISTLING is nearby now. He stops,
	calls:

					RIKER
			Hello!

	The WHISTLING has continued without pause, Riker cocks
	his ear, corrects his direction slightly.

138  EXT. WOODLAND GLEN

	Riker ENTERS SHOT through shrubbery, sees something and
	stops.

139  ANGLE ON DATA

	Lying there, cushioned by deep grass. He's totally
	absorbed in certain melody notes he's attempting -- and
	keeps missing.

140  PANNING RIKER

	Moving onto TWO SHOT where he stops, and WHISTLES the
	same melody, hitting the correct notes. A startled Data
	looks up blankly, then comes quickly to his feet, but
	Riker waves him back down, sits beside him.

					DATA
			Marvelous how easily humans do
			that, sir. I still need much
			practice.

	Riker, acting uncomfortable, avoids the subject. He
	hesitates, then:

					RIKER
			There are some puzzles down on
			the planet that Captain Picard
			wants answered. He suggests I
			put you on the away team I'll be
			using.

140  CONTINUED:

					DATA
			I shall endeavor to give
			satisfaction, sir.

	Riker hesitates, wanting to say something but not sure
	how to begin.

					RIKER
			Uh, yes. And when the captain
			suggested you I, uh, looked up
			your record...
				(hesitates)

					DATA
			Yes sir, a wise procedure always.

					RIKER
			Your rank of lieutenant commander,
			I assume now must be honorary.

					DATA
			No, sir. Starfleet Class of '78;
			honors in quantum mathematics
			and exobiology.

					RIKER
			But your files... they say you're
			a...

					DATA
				(waits, then)
			Machine? Correct, sir. Does that
			trouble you?

					RIKER
				(hesitates)
			To be honest... yes, a little.

					DATA
			Understood, sir. Prejudice is
			very human.

					RIKER
			Now that troubles me. Do you
			consider yourself superior to us?

					DATA
			I am superior in many ways. But
			I would gladly give it up to be
			human.

					RIKER
				(studies Data, then)
			Nice to meet you, Pinocchio,

140  CONTINUED: (2)

	Data seems confused by this.

					RIKER
				(continuing; explains)
			A joke.

					DATA
				(straight-faced)
			Ah! Intriguing.

					RIKER
				(big grin)
			You're going to be an interesting
			companion, Mister Data.

									FADE OUT.

                          PART SEVEN                            

	FADE IN:

141  EXT. PARKLAND - RIKER AND DATA

	We HEAR A VOICE (Wesley) and Riker gets to his feet,
	looks off in that direction.

					DATA
			This pattern is quite popular,
			sir. Perhaps because it
			duplicates Earth so well, Coming
			here,
				(apologetically)
			makes me feel as if I'm human too.

					RIKER
				(taking it all in)
			I didn't believe these could be
			so real.

					DATA
			Much of it is real, sir. If the
			transporters can convert our
			bodies to an energy beam, then
			back to the original pattern
			again...

					RIKER
			Yes, of course.
				(indicates)
			And all these have much simpler
			patterns.

142  EXT. PARKLAND AT STREAM

	Data leading the way, then indicates.

					DATA
			The rear wall.

					RIKER
				(peers)
			I can't see it.

					DATA
			You will.

	PANNING RIKER TOWARD US

	He's squinting hard now. Then he stops, reacts at
	something he can now make out.

					RIKER
			Incredible!

143  INT. STAGE HOLODECK - ANGLE PAST RIKER (OPTICAL)

	As he hurries toward where we can now SEE the holodeck
	wall (REAR PROJECTION SCREEN) on which we can now SEE
	that the PARKLAND soil, rocks and vegetation blend with
	the PROJECTED IMAGE there. Astonished, Riker backs away
	from this, squinting again.

144  EXT. REAL PARKLAND - RIKER'S P.O.V.

	Where, of course, the wall blend is no longer visible.

					WESLEY'S VOICE
				(calling)
			Mister Riker, isn't this great?

	MEDIUM ON RIKER

	Turning, then grinning, waving.

	RIKER'S P.O.V. - THE ROCK CROSSING AT STREAM

	Where Wes Crusher is hurrying toward us, bouncing from
	rock to rock.

					WESLEY
			This is one of the simpler
			patterns, Mister Riker. They've
			got thousands more, some you just
			can't believe.

	ANGLE TO INCLUDE RIKER AND DATA

	Moving down the stream.

					RIKER
			Careful, that next rock is
			loose... !

	WIDER ANGLE

	As that rock moves underfoot, tumbling Wes into the
	stream.

	PANNING DATA IN, demonstrating his enormous strength
	as he easily lifts Wesley completely out of the water.
	An amazed Wesley looks at Data.

					WESLEY
			Wow!

145  EXT. PARKLAND - ANGLE ON WILD HATCHWAY AND CORRIDOR SECTION

	As the hatchway smoothly SLIDES OPEN AGAIN. Through
	it is REVEALED THE PARKLAND, through which Riker, Data
	and a very wet Wesley make their way to the HATCHWAY.
	As they MOVE THROUGH HATCHWAY, the bulkhead BEGINS
	CLOSING.

146  INT. HOLODECK CORRIDOR - ANGLE ON CAPTAIN PICARD

	The Captain walking with a Senior Officer when he sees
	Riker and the others. He motions the Senior Officer
	to continue on by himself, stops and waits.

	VARIOUS ANGLES - AS APPROPRIATE

	As Riker, Data and Wes move INTO SHOT with Picard. Wes
	is instantly aware that his soaked clothing is dripping
	water onto the starship deck. He'd like to remove
	himself but knows that Picard has already seen his
	puddle forming on the deck.

					RIKER
			Mister Data has agreed to join
			my away team, Captain.

					PICARD
				(with another glance
				 toward Wes's puddle)
			Very good.

					WES
			Sir, maybe I should get something
			to wipe this water up.

					PICARD
				(coolly)
			Good idea.

	Picard turns and EXITS.

147  INT. SICKBAY - BEVERLY AND WESLEY

	Wesley is wiping himself dry now. He is
	enthusiastically trying to explain his adventures.

					WESLEY
			-- and there's a low gravity
			gymnasium, too. It would be hard
			to get bored on this ship.

148  CLOSER TWO SHOT - BEVERLY AND WESLEY

	As he wipes, he's been turning something over in his
	mind.

					WESLEY
			Mom...
				(beat)
			could you get me a look at the
			bridge?

					BEVERLY
			That's against the captain's
			standing orders.

					WESLEY
			Are you afraid of the captain,
			too?

					BEVERLY
			I certainly am not!

					WESLEY
			But Captain Picard is a pain,
			isn't he?

					BEVERLY
			Your father liked him very much.
			Great explorers are often lonely,
			... no chance to have a family...

					WESLEY
			Just a look, at the bridge, Mom.
			From the turbolift when the doors
			open. I wouldn't get off. I
			promise.

					BEVERLY
			You're looking for trouble, Wes.

	He shuts up. Beverly looks at him and can't ignore the
	very real want in his eyes.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			Let's see what we can do.

	On Wes's delighted grin:

									CUT TO:

149  EXT. FARPOINT STATION/CITY - DAY - EMPHASIZING STATION

	TO ESTABLISH our location.

150  INT. STATION SHOPPING AREA - DAY - ON AWAY TEAM

	Which is made up of Riker, Data, Troi, Tasha and Geordi.
	There are a number of people in the mall area, some in
	identifiable Enterprise-type uniforms. The others are
	in various civilian clothes. They are taking in the
	Bandi shops, booths, food and drink offered by Bandi
	vendors.

					TASHA
			Recommend that someone could begin
			by examining the underside of the
			station, sir.

					TROI
			Our sensors do show some passages
			down there, sir. Perhaps you and
			I?

	Troi glances at Riker with just a shade of archness,
	perhaps the lift of an eyebrow. Riker glances away,
	troubled.

					RIKER
			Tasha, you and the Counselor.

	Troi and Tasha move off. Riker turns to Geordi.

					RIKER
			Let's us start with the topside.
			Have you noticed anything unusual?

	Riker and the others move out of scene, examining
	everything they pass.

									DISSOLVE TO:

151  INT. ANOTHER STATION AREA

	ON GEORDI as he looks around the area, moving slowly
	and carefully scanning. Then he shakes his head.

					GEORDI
			Well, I can't see through solid
			matter, sir, but the material so
			far looks very ordinary.

					DATA
			Confirmed by the construction
			records, sir. Almost exactly the
			same material that Starfleet uses.

	Riker reaches to his insignia, to switch on his
	communicator.

151  CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Riker to Tasha, Troi, come in!

	We milk the next few moments, Riker growing
	apprehensive. Then, finally, with Riker showing relief:

					TASHA'S VOICE
				(from communicator)
			We were about to call you, Team
			Leader. We've found something
			interesting.

152  INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY

	Not at all what one would expect of a "service tunnel",
	if this is indeed that. These are smooth, rounded,
	glistening walls whose GLOW lights up the entire
	passageway. (We'll see something similar later on a
	mystery vessel). Tasha is activating her communicator.

					TASHA
			We're in a passageway directly
			under the station sir. But the
			tunnel walls here are make from
			something we've never seen before.

					RIKER'S VOICE
			And Troi, have you sensed anything
			there?

	Troi appears reluctant as she activates her
	communicator.

					TROI
			Sir, I've avoided opening my mind.
			Whatever I sensed in the
			Groppler's office became very
			painful.

					RIKER
			I'm sorry, Counselor, but you
			must. We need more information.

	Troi complies... then her face contorts in agony and
	a SMALL SCREAM ESCAPES. She sinks to her knees, Tasha
	hurrying in to support her.

					TROI
				(continuing)
			No, no, such pain. It's so close to
			us here... pain, pain..

152  CONTINUED:

					RIKER'S VOICE
				(overlapping)
			Hang on, I'm coming... Enterprise,
			lock us onto her signal!

	Tasha has her arm around Troi, whispering words of
	comfort.

153  ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	After a moment, the familiar TRANSPORTER SOUND BEGINS.
	Riker, Data, and Geordi BEAM IN, SOLIDIFY. Then Riker
	hurries over to Troi while Data and Geordi examine their
	surroundings with great curiosity.

154  ANGLE ON TROI

	Riker helping her very tenderly:

					RIKER
			I'm sorry. Close your mind from
			the pain...

					TROI
			It's also unhappiness... terrible
			despair...

					RIKER
			Who?

					TROI
			I don't know! No lifeform anything
			like us.

	Riker is looking around at the glowing walls.

					RIKER
			What in the hell kind of place
			is this?
				(turning)
			Geordi, what do you see?

	Geordi has been inspecting the wall closely. He shakes
	his head.

					GEORDI
			It's of no material I recognize,
			sir. Or have even heard of.

155  EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	As before, in geosynchronous orbit.

156  INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD

	in the captain's chair. The bridge is nominally manned
	at this time. We will see Worf at the ops panel.
	Picard glances around as the SOUND OF THE TURBOLIFT
	DOORS OPENING COMES OVER, and he freezes.

157  PICARD'S P.O.V. - BEVERLY AND WESLEY

	standing just inside the turbolift door. Beverly is
	uncomfortable; Wes is all eyes, taking in as much as
	he possibly can in this one limited look at his dream
	place. Beverly starts to step out, gesturing to Wes
	to stay in the turbolift.

					BEVERLY
			Permission to report to the
			captain...

158  WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING PICARD, BEVERLY

					PICARD
				(coolly)
			Children are not allowed on the
			bridge, Doctor.

					BEVERLY
			Captain, my son is not on the
			bridge. He merely accompanied
			me on the turbolift.

					PICARD
			Your son?

					BEVERLY
			His name's Wesley. You last saw
			him years ago when...

	She trails her words; Picard understands.

					PICARD
			Oh, back then.

	He glances from Beverly to Wesley, clears his throat.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Well -- as long as he's here...

159  WIDER - INCLUDING WESLEY, BEVERLY, PICARD

	Wesley looks to Picard hopefully. Beverly waits, then
	Picard shrugs, tries to sound friendly.

159  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			I knew your father, Wesley. Want
			a look around?

	Wesley is out like a shot.

					PICARD
				(continuing; quickly)
			But don't touch anything!

	Wes is in awe. To him, this is the equivalent of a
	devout Catholic stepping into the nave of St. Peter's
	Basilica. The turbolift is on the level of the
	"horseshoe", so the command positions are spread below
	him. Picard moves down to the captain's chair level,
	Wes moving with him. He is careful to put his feet down
	just right so he doesn't even scuff the floor. Picard
	watches, steps aside to gesture toward the command
	chair.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Try it out.
				(as Wes does so)
			The panel on your right is for
			log entries, library-computer
			access and retrieval, viewscreen
			control, intercoms, and so on.

					WESLEY
				(nodding; pointing)
			Yes sir. And here, the backup conn
			and ops panels, plus armament and
			shield controls.

	Picard looks closely at Wes, perplexed.

					PICARD
			The forward viewscreen is
			controlled by the ops position...

					WESLEY
			Yes sir, which uses high
			resolution, multi-spectral imaging
			sensor systems...

					PICARD
			How the hell do you know that,
			boy?

	Before Beverly or Wes can reply, a VERY DISTINCTIVE
	SIGNAL SOUNDS (Captain's comm signal) and Wes, closest
	to the control, transfers the signal into audio as:

159  CONTINUED: (2)

					WES
			Perimeter alert, Captain!

	Wesley is instantly embarrassed; Beverly is mortified;
	Picard is ang7ry.

         WES                             BEVERLY
  I'm sorry. I didn't mean          Wes! You shouldn't
  to...                             have touched anything...

					PICARD
			Off the bridge! Both of you.

	Worf has come to his feet, not sure whether or not he
	should respond to the call. Beverly is hustling Wesley
	toward the turbolift.

					WORF
			You have a perimeter alert,
			Captain.

					BEVERLY
				(to Picard)
			As my son tried to tell you!

	She EXITS into the turbolift, the doors CLOSING behind
	her and Wesley. Picard, slamming his fist into his
	other palm, jumps for his command chair as:

					PICARD
			Picard. Go ahead.

					SECURITY VOICE
			Ship's sensors have detected the
			presence of a vessel approaching
			this planet. No ship is scheduled
			to arrive at this time.

					PICARD
			Have Mister Riker, and his team
			beamed back up! Security, could
			that be the Hood returning here?

					SECURITY VOICE
			The vessel does not match the
			Hood's configuration or I.D.
			signal.

					PICARD
			Put it on main viewer!

160  ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Instantly, the image of a ship is flashed on the screen.
	It appears big, dark, ominous -- even at far range --
	and it is approaching very swiftly.

161  ANGLE ON PICARD AND WORF

					PICARD
			Identification?

					SECURITY VOICE
			Vessel unknown, configuration
			unknown, sir.

					PICARD
			Hail it!

					WORF
				(works his panel)
			We've been trying, sir. No
			response.

					PICARD
			Raise all shields, phasers at
			ready.

					WORF
				(works panel)
			Shields up, sir. Phasers ready.
				(turns to Picard)
			Could this be that "Q" you
			mentioned, sir?

162  CLOSE ON PICARD

	staring at the viewscreen.

					PICARD
			I almost hope so, Lieutenant.
			We face too many "unknowns"
			already.

163  ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	The ship is closer now -- looks menacing -- and still
	coming fast.

									FADE OUT.

                          PART EIGHT                            

	FADE IN:

164  EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	The Enterprise in orbit.

165  INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE

	All bridge positions are filled now, everyone watching
	the viewscreen intently.

166  ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	The mystery vessel approaching closer.

167  PICARD AND WORF

					PICARD
			Continue universal greeting on
			all frequencies. Get me Groppler
			Zorn.

	There is a BEEP, a pause, then:

					ZORN'S VOICE
			This is Zorn, Captain.

168  INT. ZORN'S OFFICE - DAY - ON ZORN

	He is seated at the desk, speaks into a small portable
	communicator grid shaped to fit the palm of his hand.

					PICARD'S VOICE
			There is an unidentified vessel
			moving into orbit with us. Do you
			know who it is?

169  INTERCUT BETWEEN ZORN AND PICARD AS NEEDED.

					ZORN
			There are no ships scheduled to
			arrive until --

					PICARD
			I asked if you know who it is,
			Groppler. You mentioned the
			Ferengi Alliance to me.

169  CONTINUED:

					ZORN
				(very nervous)
			But we have had no dealings with
			them. It was only a... a
			thought.

					PICARD
			Are you very, very certain of
			that, Groppler?

					ZORN
			I promise you we were making an
			empty threat, Captain. I wanted
			your cooperation. Forgive me --

					WORF
			Definitely entering an orbital
			trajectory, sir.

					SECURITY POSITION
			It measures half again our size,
			Captain.

170  EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON MYSTERY VESSEL/ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The mystery vessel approaches and settles into
	geosynchronous orbit. It is positioned slightly above
	and to the side of the Enterprise -- and it is a great
	deal larger than the Enterprise. Suddenly, A GLOWING
	PULSE OF LIGHT throbs out from the mystery vessel toward
	the Enterprise.

171  INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FULL SHOT

	The LIGHT GLOWS OVER EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE ON THE
	BRIDGE. They are startled by it, but no one is hurt.
	As the GLOW FADES AWAY:

					PICARD
			All stations, give any damage
			reports.

	The others are looking at each other, shaking their
	heads. No problems.

					WORF
			I would guess we were being
			scanned, sir.

172  INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY

	Troi is leaning against the strange, smooth and shining
	tunnel wall as if still feeling pain. Riker, obviously
	still concerned for Troi, is examining the strange
	tunnel walls with the tricorder while Geordi moves his
	"eyes" inches away from the surface to examine it
	closely. Data is testing his communicator and we'll
	HEAR him trying to get a signal back from the
	Enterprise.

					TASHA
				(to Troi)
			Pain again?

					RIKER
				(turning; sharply)
			Troi, you've been at it enough!

					TROI
			No, I feel close to an answer of
			some kind.

					DATA
				(interrupting)
			Commander, something down here
			is shielding our communicators.

					TROI
				(comes to her feet)
			Yes, that's exactly the feeling
			I've been reading. As if someone
			doesn't want us to be in touch
			with our ship.

					RIKER
			Come on...
				(leads the way)
			... let's get to the surface.

173  EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND MYSTERY VESSEL (OPTICAL)

	The mystery vessel clearly larger than the Enterprise
	and moving near it in orbit.

174  INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	On which is featured an IMAGE OF MYSTERY VESSEL.

					OPERATIONS POSITION
			There is no computer record of
			any such vessel, sir. Not even
			close.

174  CONTINUED:

					SECURITY POSITION
			Still no response, sir. We've
			done everything but threaten them.

					PICARD
			Sensor scans, Mister Worf.

					WORF
			Our sensor signals seem to just
			bounce off.
				(bites off words;
				 indicates to viewer)
			Something's happening, sir...

175  FULL ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	As a beam of something STRIKES DOWNWARD TOWARD THE
	PLANET SURFACE. (It doesn't look exactly like the
	Enterprise phasers but is the same sort of thing.)

176  EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON MYSTERY VESSEL (OPTICAL)

	As another phaser-like BEAM STRIKES DOWN AT THE PLANET.

177  INT. BRIDGE

	Excitement.

178  ANGLE ON OPS POSITION

					WORF
			They're firing on Farpoint,
			sir... !

					PICARD
				(toward Security
				 position)
			Bring phasers and photon torpedoes
			to ready!

					WORF
			No, hold it, sir. They're hitting
			the Bandi city, not Farpoint
			Station.

179  INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY

	Riker and his team racing to where the rounded, smooth
	and shining walls of the tunnel begin to give way to
	a more ordinary looking rectangular corridor of mixed
	stone and tile walls.

180  ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING STAIRWAY AHEAD

	Riker pulling to a halt in order to examine with
	curiosity the blend where the unknown type tunnel walls
	give way to stone and tile construction similar to what
	we've seen in the old Bandi city. Ahead is a stone
	block stairway leading up to that old city. Geordi has
	hurried in, peering closely at the more familiar kind
	of wall surface.

					TROI
				(indicates ahead)
			Those stairs are where Tasha and
			I entered down here, sir.

					GEORDI
			At this point, it becomes ordinary
			stone and tile, sir.
				(turns, puzzled)
			Matching what's above.

	Followed by a LONG RUMBLING EXPLOSION ("PHASER HIT"
	type) WITH THE LONG FLASH OF IT REFLECTING DOWN THE
	STAIRWAY FROM THE UPPER LEVEL AHEAD. As this SOUND
	FADES, then we HEAR A FAINT DISTANT SCREAM which dies
	away too.

					TASHA
			My God! Was that a phaser blast?

					DATA
			Negative. But something similar.

	Again, the SAME KIND OF EXPLOSION SOUND followed by
	similar LIGHT FLICKERS from the stairway ahead. Riker
	turns to Troi:

					RIKER
			You, Tasha, and Geordi will beam
			up to the ship from here. Now!
				(to Data)
			Come on, I want to see exactly
			what's happening.

	Riker starts off to the stairway, Data following.

					TROI
			Don't. If you should be hurt...

	A stern look comes over Riker's face as he turns quickly
	to her:

					RIKER
			You have your orders, Counselor!
			Carry them out!

180  CONTINUED:

					TROI
			Yes sir, I'm sorry, sir.

181  ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Riker and Data begin climbing the stairway, leaving the
	CAMERA CENTERED ON TROI, TASHA AND GEORDI. Troi has
	already reached for her communicator control.

					TROI
			Enterprise, three to beam up.

	After a moment, the familiar TRANSPORTER SOUND, followed
	by TRANSPORTER EFFECT ON THE THREE DISSOLVING INTO THE
	LIGHT SPARKLE. Then, they're gone.

182  INT. COVERED VILLAGE SQUARE (OPTICAL)

	OLD CITY IN IN B.G. where FIRE RAGES in a smashed
	structure in that part of the old city we can see. In
	CLOSER FOREGROUND is an entrance to the underground
	passageway, this entry guarded by thick, hand-worked
	metal door, locked. This village square is a connecting
	point between the Old City and Farpoint Station. A
	short distance in the OFF-CAMERA DIRECTION lies Farpoint
	Mall.

183  THE METAL DOORS (OPTICAL)

	We HEAR a hand phaser HUM as a GLOW FLICKERS OVER THE
	METAL DOORS which now spring open and a CLASHING OF
	METAL SOUND. Riker and Data ENTER SCENE though those
	door, phasers in hand.

184  CLOSER - RIKER AND DATA

	As Riker touches his communicator control.

					RIKER
			Enterprise, Riker. Come in.

0T   INTERRUPTED BY THE CLOSER SOUND OF A PHASER-LIKE BOLT FROM THE
	MYSTERY VESSEL. Also from closer, THE LIGHT OF THE
	BLAST REFLECTS ON THEIR FACES and they whirl to see:

186  ANGLE INTO OLD CITY

	Where a building is being BLASTED INTO STONES AND DUST.

187  INT. ZORN'S OFFICE - OLD CITY

	Filled with the dust and SOUNDS of a nearby BLAST. Zorn
	is working frantically with his communicator.

					ZORN
			Enterprise, Enterprise, help us!
			Come in, please...

188  INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	On MAIN VIEWER THE IMAGE OF THE mystery vessel which
	as we watch will FIRE ANOTHER PHASER-LIKE BOLT DOWN
	TOWARD THE PLANET. The bridge crew are anxiously poised
	on the edge of their seats, waiting for Picard's next
	order.

					ZORN'S VOICE
			... what shall we do? Help us,
			please.

					PICARD
				(overlapping)
			Tune him down!
				(into transmitter)
			Commander Riker, go ahead. Where
			are you?

189  ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING TURBOLIFT

	As the doors SNAP OPEN TO REVEAL TROI, TASHA, AND GEORDI
	who hurry onto the bridge, take their regular positions
	(Geordi relieving Ops). Meanwhile:

					RIKER'S VOICE
			With Data, on the edge of the old
			city, Captain. It's being hit
			hard. Who's doing this?

					PICARD
			And Farpoint Station? Any damage
			there?

190  INT. COVERED VILLAGE SQUARE - FARPOINT MALL IN B.G.

	No indication that Farpoint Station has been damaged
	at all. Riker, standing with Data, is using his
	communicator.

190  CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Negative on damage to Farpoint,
			sir. Whoever they are, it seems
			they're carefully avoiding hitting
			the station.

					PICARD'S VOICE
			It's from an unidentified vessel
			that's entered orbit with us here.
			No ID, no answer to our signals...

	During which there's another BLAST SOUND with the same
	kind of LIGHT FLICKERS.

191  ANGLE INCLUDING OLD CITY

	As Riker whirls again in that direction, interrupting
	Picard:

					RIKER
			They're hitting the Bandi city
			hard, sir. Many casualties very
			probable.

192  INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD

	Everything as we last left it.

					PICARD
				(into transmitter)
			Understand, Commander. Would you
			object to a clearly illegal
			kidnapping assignment?

					RIKER'S VOICE
			No objection; anything you order,
			sir.

					PICARD
			Zorn may have the answers we need.
			Get Groppler Zorn and bring him
			here!

					RIKER'S VOICE
			Aye, sir!

193  ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	Picard looks at the IMAGE of the huge mystery vessel
	still in orbit nearby. Picard turns to Troi:

193  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			They're forcing a difficult
			decision on me, Counselor.

					TROI
				(nods)
			But, I doubt protecting the Bandi
			would violate the Prime Directive.
			True, they are not actual
			allies...

					PICARD
			But we are in the midst of
			diplomatic discussions with them.
				(turns to Tasha)
			Lock phasers on that vessel,
			Lieutenant.

194  ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	In b.g., Tasha touching panel controls.

					TASHA
			Phasers locked on, Captain.

	Anything further INTERRUPTED BY OPTICAL EFFECT, the
	BLINDING LIGHT FLASH we've seen before and FADING TO
	REVEAL "Q", wearing the Judge's costume from the earlier
	courtroom sequence. He is standing in front of Picard.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Typical, so typical. Savage
			lifeforms never follow even their
			own rules.

									FADE OUT.

                           PART NINE                            

	FADE IN:

195  EXT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD AND "Q"

	Rather than being nervous over the arrival of "Q"
	(JUDGE), Picard has become coldly angry.

					PICARD
			Get off my bridge!

196  ANOTHER ANGLE

	"Q" stepping toward Picard, smiling sadly.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Also interesting, that order about
			phasers.

					TASHA
				(ignoring "Q"; to
				 Picard)
			Still standing by on phasers,
			Captain.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(turning to Picard)
			Please don't let me interfere.
			Use your weapons.

					PICARD
			You're the one who has a lot to
			learn, "Q". With no idea of who's
			on that vessel, my order was a
			routine safety precaution.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(breaking into LAUGHTER)
			Really? No idea of what it
			represents? The meaning of that
			vessel is as plain as...
				(then taps his nose)
			... as plain as the noses on your
			ugly little primate faces.

196  CONTINUED:

	LOUDER LAUGHTER.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(trying to control it)
			And if you were truly civilized,
			Captain, wouldn't you be doing
			something about the casualties
			happening down there?

	In answer, Picard touches the communications control on
	his uniform.

					PICARD
			Captain to CMO, are you reading
			any of this?

197  INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE EMPHASIZING BEVERLY

	But she's with a half dozen MEDICAL ASSISTANTS very busy
	preparing medical supplies, bringing portable medical
	equipment, etc.

					BEVERLY
			Medical teams already preparing
			to beam down, Captain.

					PICARD'S VOICE
				(relieved)
			Compliments on that, Doctor!

198  INT. BRIDGE

	Picard turning back to "Q".

					PICARD
			Any questions? Starfleet people
			are trained to render aid and
			assistance whenever...

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(interrupting)
			But not trained in clear thinking.

					PICARD
			Let's consider your thoughts.
			You call us "savages" and yet you
			knew those people down there would
			be killed. You're the one whose
			conduct is uncivilized.

					WORF
			Sir, they're firing on the planet
			again.

199  ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	Where we SEE the mystery vessel beginning to FIRE BLASTS
	down at the planet again.

					PICARD
			Forcefields full on.
				(to Worf)
			Go to thrusters! Position us
			between that vessel and the
			planet.

					WORF
			Aye, sir, thruster power to...

	Worf trails his words, perplexed. His panel is fading,
	GOING DARK.

					WORF
				(continuing)
			We have no ship control, sir.
			It's gone!

200  INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ZORN'S OFFICE - DAY - RIKER AND DATA

	They are headed toward Zorn's office door when the BLUE
	BOLT HITS beside the door, flooding the scene with a
	FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT. The corridor rocks, and the
	ceiling comes down partially. Riker and Data are flung
	down by the explosion. A beat, and then Data stirs,
	sits up. Riker is slower, but is managing to haul
	himself upright.

					DATA
			Are you undamaged?

					RIKER
			Yes. You?

	Data's eyes glaze slightly as he seems to go into a sort
	of "trance" that lasts just a few seconds. Then:

					DATA
			All systems operating.

201  ANGLE INCLUDING ZORN'S OFFICE DOOR

	It is hanging by its hinges, and debris-dust is drifting
	out of it. Riker and Data move quickly to and through
	the open door.

202  INT. ZORN'S OFFICE - DAY - FULL SHOT

	As Riker and Data ENTER. The office has been badly
	damaged, especially near the door. O.S. THE SOUND OF
	ANOTHER BOLT EXPLODING echoes. The room shakes under
	the impact. There is a MUFFLED SOB near the desk.

203  CLOSER ANGLE - NEAR DESK

	Zorn is cowering under his elegant desk, shaking and
	sobbing in fear.

					ZORN
			Please. You can make it stop.
			Drive it away.

					RIKER
			Drive who away, Groppler?

	Zorn reacts as if he knows he's said too much.

					ZORN
			I don't know.

					DATA
			Unlikely, sir.
				(to Zorn)
			Our records show that you
			supervised all Bandi contact with
			other worlds...

					ZORN
			We haven't done anything wrong!

					RIKER
			Then if we can learn nothing from
			you, perhaps we'll leave.

					ZORN
				(frightened)
			No! No, don't leave, I'll try
			to explain some of...

204  EMPHASIZING ZORN (OPTICAL)

	A kind of TRANSPORTER SOUND is heard, and then a
	TRANSPORTER EFFECT, somewhat different from the
	Starfleet variety, centers on Zorn. He beging SCREAMING
	as he FADES FROM VIEW.

205  ANGLE ON RIKER

	As he keys his communicator.

205  CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			First officer to Enterprise.

					PICARD'S VOICE
			Go ahead, Riker.

					RIKER
			We've lost Zorn, sir. Something
			like a transporter beam, it
			snatched him out of here.

206  INT. BRIDGE

	"Q" still in the captain's seat, listening to:

					RIKER'S VOICE
			Question, sir, could it have been
			the "Q" character you met earlier.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(laughs)
			None of you know who it is?
			You're running out of time,
			Captain.

207  ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND TROI

	She's frowning, trying to 'feel' something.

					TROI
			Captain... Suddenly I'm sensing
			something else. It's
			satisfaction, enormous
			satisfaction.

					PICARD
			From the same source as before?

					TROI
			No, that was on the planet.
				(indicates)
			This seems to be from here.

208  ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	And the image of the mystery vessel.

208  CONTINUED:

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(to Troi)
			Excellent, Counselor!
				(indicates Picard)
			He's such a dullard, isn't he!

					INTERCOM VOICE
			Captain from Transporter Room.
			First officer and Mister Data now
			beaming aboard.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			Excellent also!
				(to Picard)
			Perhaps with more of these little
			minds helping, you'll...

209  EMPHASIZING PICARD

	As he whirls suddenly on "Q".

					PICARD
				(interrupting)
			That is enough, damn it!

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			We have an agreement; have you
			forgotten... ?

	In b.g., the turbolift doors SNAP OPEN but unnoticed by
	Picard and "Q" as they continue their argument. Riker
	and Data appear, move onto bridge as:

					PICARD
			We have an agreement which you
			are at this moment breaking by
			taking over our vessel,
			interfering with my decisions!
				(steps up nose-to-nose)
			You are not welcome on my bridge.
			Now, either leave or finish us.
			One of the two!

	"Q" stands, during which we have the impression that
	everyone is holding his breath. Then:

					"Q" (JUDGE)
				(gently)
			Temper, temper, mon capitaine. I
			am merely trying to assist a
			pitiful species. Perhaps I'll
			leave if Mister Riker provides
			me with some amusement.

209  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(to Riker)
			Do nothing that he asks!

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			But I ask so little. And it is
			so necessary if you are to solve
			all this.
				(turns; indicates vessel
				 image in Main Viewer)
			Beam over there with your... what
			is it called... your "away team"?
				(to Picard)
			You should already know what
			you'll find there. But perhaps
			it was too adult a puzzle for you.

					RIKER
			Captain, with all respect, I
			intended to suggest beaming over
			there.

210  EMPHASIZING "Q" (OPTICAL)

	Amused at all this. He turns from Riker to look at
	Picard.

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			You show promise, my good fellow.

					PICARD
			But you don't. You should have
			long ago realized that, humanity
			is NOT a criminal race!

					"Q" (JUDGE)
			YOU MUST STILL PROVE THAT!

	A familiar BLINDING FLASH, and then "Q" is gone.

211  ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER

	Realizing "Q" is gone, turning to look at each other.
	Riker checks a reading on his panel.

					RIKER
			Of the 24 hours "Q" gave us, we have
			less than one left, sir.

211  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(nods)
			But I had a feeling you impressed
			him, Number One. That's hopeful.

					RIKER
			Thank you, Captain, That's the
			first time you've called me
			"Number One".

					PICARD
				(small smile)
			I believe I'll enjoy getting to
			know you, Bill. If we live long
			enough.

									FADE OUT.

                           PART TEN                             

	FADE IN:
212  EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND MYSTERY VESSEL (OPTICAL)

	In orbit over the planet.

213  INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

	Riker's away team moving onto the transporter platform.
	With him are Data, Troi, and Tasha. They carry the
	usual away team equipment which they're now checking.

					RIKER
			Phasers on stun.

	Everyone checks hand phasers. AD-LIB answers of
	"checked", "on stun," etc. Riker turns to Transporter
	Chief.

					RIKER
			Energize.

214  INT. MYSTERY SHIP TUNNEL - WIDE ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	TRANSPORTER SOUND, then the BEAMING EFFECT. Then, fully
	MATERIALIZED, Riker and the others look around to orient
	themselves.

					DATA
			Most interesting, sir.

					TASHA
			Much the same construction as the
			underground tunnel we saw.

	Which describes it perfectly. The same rounded shape
	and GLOWING WALL of unknown composition. The "tunnel"
	is deserted; NO SHIP SOUNDS of any kind.

					TASHA
				(continuing)
			But no sound of power; no
			equipment. How does this ship
			run?

	Riker nods a direction. Tasha takes the point as they
	move out. Clearly, these are exceptionally well trained
	people. Data is already using his tricorder to check
	the walls. He obviously gets nothing, shakes his head.
	Troi suddenly staggers, GROANS.

214  CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Troi, what is it?!
				(waits anxiously)
			Is it the same as you felt down
			there?

					TROI
			No, this is... different. It
			feels much more powerful... full
			of anger... hate...

					TASHA
			Toward us?

					TROI
			No. It's directed down toward
			the old Bandi city.

					DATA
			Most intriguing again. The place
			that this vessel was firing
			upon...
				(abruptly stops; to
				 Riker)
			Sorry, sir, I seem to be
			commenting on everything.

					RIKER
				(small smile)
			Good. Don't stop it, my friend.

215  EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)

	Enterprise and the mystery vessel still in orbit.

216  INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD

	Geordi and Worf at their positions. Picard is in the
	command seat, antsy.

					RIKER'S VOICE
			Enterprise, Riker. This is
			turning out to be a very long
			tunnel or corridor, sir. Still
			no sign of mechanism or
			circuitry...

217  INT. NARROW MYSTERY SHIP TUNNEL - RIKER AND GROUP

	Still led and followed by the security people, they're
	now moving along fairly rapidly although this tunnel
	is narrower here. Otherwise, its look hasn't changed.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			... or controls, readouts, nothing
			at all like any vessel I've seen
			before.

					TROI
				(interrupting)
			Groppler Zorn, sir... in great
			fear...
				(motions)
			Just ahead.

218  INT. TUNNEL CONNECTION

	Troi and the team arriving, standing puzzled at what
	seems to be only a sharp turn where we SEE a strange
	indentation in the tunnel wall there. Troi, intent on
	this, steps closer, pushes her body against the
	indentation.

					TROI
			It's definitely Zorn, Commander.
			Here!

					RIKER
				(stepping in)
			Careful...

	But the tunnel wall is soft here -- it gives
	perceptibly, as Troi pushes harder and then PLOP... she
	disappears through it. (NOTE: Or the 'wall' opens to
	let her through and then closes behind her.)

					RIKER
			Troi!!!

	Then he pushes, disappears through the same wall.

219  INT. ZORN'S "CELL"

	Riker sliding through the pliable opening in the tunnel
	wall, joining Troi who is standing there aghast at what
	is suspended in the center of this area.

220  ANGLE AT FORCE FIELD (OPTICAL)

	Zorn is held suspended off the deck in the center of
	a cylindrical forcefield. The force field edges GLITTER
	SOFTLY to outline the shape of it.

221  ANGLE ON THE AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)

	As the other team members come through the 'wall' too,
	stand, reacting at the sight of Zorn.

222  ANGLE AT FORCE FIELD (OPTICAL)

	The FORCEFIELD SPARKLES, CLICKS, causing Zorn to writhe
	and twitch. He SCREAMS.

					ZORN
			No! Please! No more! Please,
			no more...

223  ANGLE ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)

	They move forward toward him, and are brought up sharply
	by the leading edge of the force field. Data has
	already started to scan with his tricorder. Riker calls
	to Zorn.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Zorn. Can you hear me?

	Zorn manages to lift his head, and WE SEE his
	pain-filled face, his features twisted into a grimace
	of intense agony.

					ZORN
			Make it stop the pain. Please...

					TROI
			Has the alien communicated... ?
				(breaks off; then to
				 Riker)
			That's it, sir! It's just one
			alien that I'm sensing here.

					ZORN
				(another GROAN)
			Please! I don't understand what
			it wants.

					TROI
				(studying Zorn; then)
			Not true. He does know.

223  CONTINUED:

	Data interrupts by holding his tricorder so that Riker
	can see the readings he's gathered. Riker registers
	at seeing something unique as Data pulls out his phaser,
	Riker does the same and both of them concentrate on
	making some exact setting on their phasers.

224  ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	As Data and Riker raise their phasers toward Zorn.

					ZORN
				(in terror)
			No, no, please don't!

	Data and Riker trigger their phasers and we SEE a SORT
	OF COLORED GLOW on the FORCEFIELD HOLDING Zorn, the GLOW
	SPREADING OVER THE ENTIRE FORCEFIELD. Then, suddenly
	the FORCEFIELD DISAPPEARS, GLOW AND ALL, and Zorn
	tumbles out onto the floor free of restraint.

225  EMPHASIZING "LIVE" PART OF CELL WALL (EFFECTS)

	Where the wall seems to be "alive", undulating. Beyond
	it, Tasha is assisting Zorn to his feet, supporting him.
	Meanwhile, Troi looks around Zorn's "cell", sensing
	something troubling. Riker has turned on his
	communicator:

					RIKER
			Away team to Enterprise...

	A TENDRIL OF PLASMA EMERGES FROM THIS PART OF THE WALL,
	swaying and moving toward Troi.

					DATA
				(interrupting; warning)
			Troi... !

	But the TENDRIL is already wrapping around her. Data
	tries to pull the TENDRIL from Troi, succeeds only in
	getting a NEW TENDRIL wrapped around himself.

226  ANOTHER ANGLE (EFFECTS)

	The floor of the area suddenly going soft, away team
	members sinking into it while still ANOTHER SECTION OF
	WALL FOLDS ITSELF OVER TASHA. (What we're seeing is
	this part of the mystery "vessel" becoming a living
	thing.)

226  CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Enterprise, come in. Beam us...

	Interrupted as his feet are YANKED OUT FROM UNDER HIM.

					DATA
			Enterprise, we need help...

	Interrupted by the NEW TENDRIL WRAPPING ITSELF AROUND
	HIS HEAD.

227  INT. BRIDGE

	Picard speaking anxiously toward his command panel as
	we HEAR Riker's MUFFLED SOUNDS OF DISTRESS.

					PICARD
			Transporter chief, yank them back!
			Now!

					WORF
			Captain... !

228  ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	Toward which Lieutenant Worf is pointing. On it the
	IMAGE of the mystery vessel is BEGINNING TO CHANGE IN
	SHAPE. The firm, hard edges of the spaceship are giving
	way to something softer, very mysterious in nature.

229  ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	In which we SEE a familiar BLINDING FLASH and "Q"
	appears, now wearing the uniform of a STARFLEET CAPTAIN.

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			Your time is up, Captain.

					PICARD
			Get off my bridge!
				(into command panel)
			Transporter Chief, do you have
			their coordinates?

230  ANOTHER ANGLE (EFFECTS)

	"Q" stepping to the command position.

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			He can't hear you, Captain.

230  CONTINUED:

	"Q" gestures upward, at which Picard is suddenly lifted
	into the air and then to the side of "Q"'s hand motion
	in that direction.

					PICARD
			"Q", I've people in trouble over
			there... !

	As Picard hovers above, "Q" steps up and sits in
	Picard's command position. Bridge personnel are coming
	to their feet angrily, then hesitate as:

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Everyone, at ease! That's an
			order!
				(to "Q")
			My people are in trouble, "Q".
			Help them; I'll do whatever you
			say...

	As "Q" gives another hand signal downward, the Captain
	is gently deposited onto the deck.

231  WIDE PORTION OF BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	As the same strange transporter SOUND that accompanied
	Zorn's "kidnapping" is heard and the same STRANGE
	TRANSPORTER EFFECT APPEARS, this time MATERIALIZING FIVE
	IMAGES -- Riker, Data, Troi, Tasha, and Groppler Zorn.

232  ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD

	Very surprised, looking from his away team to "Q".

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			You'll do whatever I say?

					PICARD
				(hesitates; nods)
			It seems I did make that bargain.

					TROI
			The agreement isn't valid, sir.
			It wasn't "Q" that saved us.

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
				(quickly; indicating
				 viewer)
			Save yourselves! It may attack
			you now.

233  ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	On which the changed IMAGE of the mystery "vessel" seems
	to be floating in closer to the Enterprise.

					RIKER
			It was that which sent us back,
			Captain.

					TROI
			Yes sir. It's not a vessel, sir.
			It's alive somehow...

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			She lies! Destroy it while you
			have a chance.
				(to Tasha)
			Make phasers and photon torpedoes
			ready... !

					PICARD
			No! Do nothing he suggests!

					ZORN
			But that thing was killing my
			people, Captain...

					PICARD
			True, but why? Was there a
			reason?

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			It is an unknown, Captain! Isn't
			that enough?

					PICARD
			If you had earned that uniform
			you're wearing, you'd know that
			the unknown is what brings us out
			here!

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			Wasted effort, considering the
			human intelligence.

					PICARD
			Let's test that...
				(to Zorn)
			... starting with the tunnels you
			have under Farpoint, Groppler.

					RIKER
			Identical to the ones on that
			space vessel lifeform, over there.
			Why was it punishing you,
			Groppler?

233  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			In return for pain you caused to
			some other creature?

					ZORN
			We did nothing wrong! It was
			injured, we helped it...

					PICARD
				(interrupting; to Zorn)
			Thank you, that was the missing
			part.
				(turns)
			Tasha, rig phasers to deliver an
			energy beam.

					TASHA
				(puzzled)
			Aye, sir.

	Tasha steps to her panel, makes settings on controls
	there.

					RIKER
			Yes, Captain, I understand now.
			It has to be conceivable that
			somewhere in the galaxy there
			could exist creatures able to
			convert energy into matter...

					PICARD
				(nodding)
			And into specific patterns of
			matter. Much as our transporters
			do.

					TASHA
				(indicating)
			On the viewer, Captain!

234  ANGLE EMPHASIZING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	Where the vessel/creature IMAGE is SOFTENING FURTHER
	INTO AN AMORPHOUS, COLORFUL AND LOVELY SHAPE. Picard
	turns to the Groppler, demanding:

					PICARD
			Zorn, you captured something like
			that, didn't you?

	On main viewer, the IMAGE NOW SHOWS LOVELY FEATHERY
	TENDRILS, and it is BEGINNING TO MOVE DOWN TOWARD THE
	PLANET. Zorn reacts to this, shows panic.

234  CONTINUED:

					ZORN
			Warn my people, please! Leave
			Farpoint Station immediately!

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			He's lied to you, Captain.
			Shouldn't you let his people die?

					PICARD
				(nods to Ops)
			Transmit the message. "Leave
			Farpoint immediately".

					TROI
			Then it was a pair of creatures
			I was sensing. One down there
			in grief and pain, the other up
			here, filled with anger...

					DATA
				(nodding)
			And firing not on the new space
			station, but on the old Bandi
			city.

					PICARD
				(to "Q")
			Attacking those who captured
			it's...
				(to Troi)
			... it's mate?

					TASHA
			Energy beam ready, sir.

					PICARD
				(to Tasha)
			Lock it in on Farpoint Station.

	"Q" stands in an annoyed manner, indicates the captain's
	position to Picard.

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			I see now it was too simple a
			puzzle. But generosity has always
			been my weakness.

	As "Q" moves aside, Picard takes his position, turning
	to Tasha.

					PICARD
			Let it have whatever it can
			absorb. Energize!

235  EXT SPACE - THE ENTERRPISE (OPTICAL)

	in orbit, as a THICK, PALE BLUE ENERGY BEAM AIMS
	DOWNWARD.

236  EXT. FARPOINT STATION (OPTICAL)

	HIGH DOWNWARD SHOT SHOWING THE ENERGY BEAM terminating
	and being absorbed into Farpoint Station.

237  INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	Picard and others watching the energy beam terminating
	at Farpoint Station.

					TASHA
			Now getting feedback on the beam,
			sir.

					PICARD
			Discontinue it.
				(to Zorn)
			Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be
			no Farpoint Station if I'm right
			about this.

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			A lucky guess!

					ZORN
			I know we deserve this loss, but
			please believe me, we meant not
			to harm the creature, but to use
			it.

					TROI
			Sir, a feeling of great joy. And
			gratitude.

238  EXT. FARPOINT STATION (OPTICAL)

	The city/station miniature -- the Farpoint Station part
	of it GROWING SOFT, SHIMMERING, SLOWLY BECOMES A
	CREATURE OF GOSSAMER, FEATHERY LIGHTNESS -- now
	gracefully rising up from its captivity.

239  ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Where what was once the "mystery vessel" but now an
	increasingly beautiful COLORFUL, FEATHERY TENDRIL SHAPE
	is descending closer and closer to what was once the
	Farpoint Station part of city/station (miniature).

239  CONTINUED:

	THE TWO CREATURES (OPTICAL)

	The smaller one rising up toward its mate. They touch
	-- delicate matter/energy tendrils twining -- and then
	together they move upwards out of sight.

240  EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	As the two creatures rise up past it.

241  INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	On which the two creatures are rising upward OUT OF
	IMAGE FRAME.

					TROI
			Great joy and gratitude... from
			both of them.

242  ANGLE EMPHASIZING "Q" (OPTICAL)

	As Picard turns on him.

					PICARD
			And why? Because it furnishes
			entertainment to you! You use
			other lifeforms for recreation.

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			If so, you've not provided the
			best...

					PICARD
			Get off my ship, you smug
			hypocrite.

					"Q" (STARFLEET)
			Why not? We can also meet
			another time, another place.

					PICARD
			That's doesn't frighten us at
			all! You accuse us of "grievous
			savagery"? No, the one proven
			guilty of that crime is you!

242  CONTINUED:

	ANOTHER BLINDING FLASH AND "Q" DISAPPEARS. It takes
	a moment to realize that he is gone. Then:

					RIKER
			I trust this isn't the usual way
			our missions will go, sir.

	Picard screws up his face in mock consideration of this,
	then nods.

					PICARD
			On no, Number One, I'm sure
			they'll be much more interesting.

									FADE OUT.

                            THE END
