ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS	PICARD, WORF, DATA, RIKER, TROI, SUPERNUMERARIES as	needed.					DATA			Captain, we are nearing the			periphery of Sector			twenty-one-five-oh-three.					PICARD			Be on the lookout for a Cardassian			patrol vessel, Mister Worf.			They should be hailing us soon.					RIKER			Even with a treaty, they're			skittish about protecting their			borders.	Picard is on his feet, walks toward the viewscreen,	gazing at the field of stars.					PICARD			Last time I was in this sector,			I was on the Stargazer, running			at warp speed ahead of a			Cardassian warship.      STAR TREK: "The Wounded" - REV. 10/29/90 - TEASER      2.2    CONTINUED:					TROI				(amused)			Running, Captain? You? That's			hard to believe...					PICARD			Believe it. I'd been sent to make			preliminary overtures to a			truce... I lowered my shields as			a gesture of good will. But the			Cardassians weren't impressed.			They took out most of my weapons			and damaged the impulse engines			before I could regroup and run.					WORF			The Cardassians have no honor.			I do not trust them.					TROI			They're our allies now, Worf.			We have to trust them.					WORF			Trust is earned, not given away.	Picard smiles wryly at his outspoken Security Officer.					PICARD			Well, I hope their scout vessel			makes contact soon. It's not a			good idea to stay too long on a			Cardassian border without making			your intentions known.3    CLOSE ON A PLATE OF FOOD (OPTICAL)	which MATERIALIZES in the replicator -- largely	unrecognizable, of skimpy portions, and not	particularly appealing.									CUT TO:4    INT.

I'm not a fish.	She smiles brightly, unoffended.					KEIKO			It's very healthy. I had this			for breakfast every morning when			I was growing up.					O'BRIEN			No oatmeal -- or muffins? How			about corned beef and eggs?					KEIKO			For breakfast?	She continues to eat heartily.      STAR TREK: "The Wounded" - REV. 10/23/90 - TEASER      4.4    CONTINUED: (2)					O'BRIEN				(carefully)			Keiko, I've been thinking...			You've introduced me to all the			wonderful foods you're accustomed			to...

She thought real food			was more nutritious.					KEIKO				(with mild distaste)			She handled... real meat...			touched it and cut it?					O'BRIEN			Like a chef. She was fantastic.			Of course, I'll have to use the			replicator... but I'll make			something special for you tonight.			You'll love it, I promise.	She smiles, swings her arms around his neck, pulls him	close.      STAR TREK: "The Wounded" - REV. 10/29/90 - TEASER      5.4    CONTINUED: (3)					KEIKO			Okay. Maybe I'll have something			special for you, tonight, too...	She kisses him gently... then there is a muffled	explosion and a tremor in the room. Keiko pulls back,	startled.

These are humanoid	aliens -- sleek, handsome, intense.					MACET			I am Gul Macet of the Cardassian			ship Trager.					PICARD			Why have you fired on us?					MACET			A curious question. In war, one			attacks one's enemies.					PICARD				(perplexed)			There is a treaty between our			people...					MACET			Perhaps that fact was unknown to			the Federation starship which			destroyed our space station in			the Cuellar System two days ago.	Picard is taken aback -- this is news to him.					PICARD			A Federation starship... ?					MACET			Attacked an unarmed science			station.

The alternative			is for us to continue firing at			each other. In such a contest,			you would be at a disadvantage.					MACET			Very well.

It was the starship			Phoenix... under the command of			Benjamin Maxwell.					PICARD			Ben Maxwell... he's one of			Starfleet's finest Captains...			he must have had provocation.					ADMIRAL HADEN			I wish we knew. He's gone on			silent running... doesn't answer			our communiques.					PICARD			Then he's still in Cardassian			space.					ADMIRAL HADEN				(acknowledges)			The station he destroyed was in			sector twenty-one-five-oh-five			-- you're the nearest starship.			We want you to go in and find			him.					PICARD			Will the Cardassians			cooperate... ?					ADMIRAL HADEN			They've granted you safe			passage... We've agreed that			you'll take along a delegation			of observers as a show of good			faith.				(beat)			Jean-Luc...

I don't want them to feel			like prisoners.	Worf is silent, but his look is eloquent.					RIKER			I'm inclined to agree with Worf,			Captain. I would limit their			access while they're on board.			They don't need the run of the			ship.	A minor rebellion here. Picard faces them.					PICARD			I understand your concerns. And			I realize... that we have had			a long and difficult history with			the Cardassians.	He paces, formulating his thoughts.					PICARD			However... it is not an			exaggeration to say that the			difference between peace... and			war... is up to us. And the way			we treat the Cardassians may make			the difference.					WORF			At least let me post guards at			some of the sensitive areas of			the ship.					PICARD				(considers)			Very well, we will limit their			access. But instruct your			people... they are guests.	He turns to Troi.     STAR TREK: "The Wounded" - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT ONE     13.15   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Counselor, stay close to the			crew.

I'm proud to			say I did.     STAR TREK: "The Wounded" - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT ONE     14.16   CONTINUED:					RIKER			It seems Maxwell has taken it			upon himself to destroy a			Cardassian space station.	O'Brien is taken aback, but there is no flickering in	his loyalty.					O'BRIEN			If that's true, sir, there was			a reason for it. I'd bank my life			on that.	Riker and Troi both take note of the fervent defense.					RIKER			The Captain may want to talk to			you about him.				(re: Transport)			Bring them aboard.	He manipulates his controls, there is the shimmering	EFFECT, and three Cardassians -- Gul Macet and two	aides -- MATERIALIZE on the pad. Riker steps forward	as they descend.					RIKER			Welcome to the Enterprise.

Riker guides them toward	the door. The Cardassians see O'Brien, who cannot	entirely disguise his discomfort around his former	enemies.					RIKER			Our Transporter Chief, Mister			O'Brien.	The Cardassians nod politely. O'Brien inclines his	head only enough to have acknowledged them. He stares	straight ahead, not making eye contact.

I			was grateful when I realized it			was you Starfleet sent after me.			Somebody who knows what it's			really like out here.					PICARD			I know of nothing out here that			could justify what you've done.	Maxwell presses his fingers together like a professor	calmly explaining a difficult theorem to a student.					MAXWELL			Then listen to this -- the			Cardassians are arming again.			That so-called science station?			A military supply port.					PICARD			How do you know this?					MAXWELL			Information comes my way.					PICARD			From whom? Where is your			documentation?	Maxwell flashes him a look; he doesn't like being	challenged.					MAXWELL			You know how these things work...			you see things, you hear things...			you add them up and you know damn			well what's going on.					PICARD			In other words, you have no			documentation...    STAR TREK: "The Wounded" - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT FOUR    44.42   CONTINUED: (2)					MAXWELL			I know what they're doing. I can			smell it. There's no good reason			for a science station in the			Cuellar System... but it's a hell			of a strategic site for a			military transport station... a			jumping off point into three			Federation sectors. They're			running supply ships back and			forth... and nobody's gonna tell			me it's for scientific research...					PICARD			Whatever circumstances you			believed you encountered, why			didn't you notify Starfleet?					MAXWELL			And wait six months while the			bureaucrats sit around reading			reports, trying to figure out what			to do? They don't know what's			going on out here... but you			should, Picard, you know what it's			like to be under fire...					PICARD			You weren't under fire.					MAXWELL			Lives were at stake...					PICARD			Whose lives?					MAXWELL			We had to act now...					PICARD			Why?	A beat as Maxwell stares at him, the good-buddy, out	here in trenches together bull-stuff is gone.					MAXWELL			It smells musty in here... like			a bureaucrat's office.    STAR TREK: "The Wounded" - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT FOUR    45.42   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			You have killed nearly seven			hundred people... taken us to the			brink of war...					MAXWELL			I have prevented war... or at the			very least delayed it a good long			time. The peace treaty was a			ruse, to give them breathing room,			time to regroup...					PICARD			And so you alone simply decided			to dispose of the treaty...					MAXWELL			I took the initiative... I did			what had to be done...					PICARD			'What had to be done'? For whom,			Maxwell?				(beat)			Why does a man with your long,			brilliant service suddenly abandon			the fundamental principles that			he has believed in, even fought			for, all his life... ? I'll tell			you what I believe... it was			because of what they did to your			wife... and your children...					MAXWELL			... Not true. Not true...					PICARD			... to avenge their deaths.	Maxwell is wounded, frustrated, realizing he cannot	win this confrontation...					MAXWELL			You're a fool, Picard. History			will look at you and say 'this			man was a fool'.					PICARD			I'll accept the judgement of			history.     STAR TREK: "The Wounded" - REV. 11/1/90 - ACT FOUR     46.42   CONTINUED: (4)					MAXWELL			When it becomes clear what the			Cardassians have done, I will be			vindicated.					PICARD			What the Cardassians have or			haven't done is irrelevant...					MAXWELL			Irrelevant... come with me and			find one of their supply ships			and we'll see how irrelevant it			is...					PICARD			We are not going after any more			Cardassian ships, Captain			Maxwell... you are going to return			to your bridge and set a course			for Starbase Two-one-one... the			Phoenix and the Enterprise will			return to Federation space			together. I will permit you			the dignity of retaining your			command during our voyage. My			only alternative would be to put			you in our brig, while we tow			your ship back to starbase in			disgrace.         STAR TREK: "The Wounded" - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT FOUR        47.42   CONTINUED: (5)	There's not much choice and Maxwell knows that. When	he speaks, he is broken, lost.					MAXWELL			I will return to my ship.					PICARD			You understand your orders?					MAXWELL			Yes, Captain.	Picard touches his insignia.					PICARD			Mister Worf, report to my Ready			Room.

Can you get an			accurate enough fix on his shield			modulation to get through?					O'BRIEN			I think so. The Phoenix should			be following standard Starfleet			protocols. They have to align			their shields at the start of			every sweep.					GEORDI			So you'll sync up the beam...					O'BRIEN			And slip right through...	He holds up both hands... slips the fingers of his left	hand through the separated fingers of his right.					GEORDI			But if there's any phase error...			you could materialize outside the			ship... we'd never have a chance			to correct.					O'BRIEN			I've been monitoring his sweep			patterns...
