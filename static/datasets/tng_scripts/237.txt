INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY	Picard is in a chair. A Cardassian MED TECH checks a	PADD which increases or decreases the amount of neural	chemicals administered. Gul Madred sits behind his	desk, checks his PADD during Picard's responses.	Picard looks straight ahead and speaks with a stream of	consciousness detachment. He is clearly under the	influence of a chemical substance.					MADRED			Place of birth?					PICARD			La Barre, France...					MADRED			Mother's name?					PICARD			Yvette Gessard...	Madred glances over at the Medical Officer.					MADRED			He's ready.

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE & CARDASSIAN SHIP	(OPTICAL)	The two ships facing each other in space.					JELLICO (V.O.)			Captain's Log: Stardate 46360.8			The negotiations with the			Cardassians have made little			progress. Gul Lemec continues to			insist on a complete Federation			withdrawal from the border and I			continue to refuse. I believe a			military confrontation may be			unavoidable.6    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	JELLICO, RIKER, and TROI are seated at the table,	wearily listening to GUL LEMEC, who is pacing the room	and droning on and on. GLIN CORAK and GLIN TAJOR are	also seated.					JELLICO			Gul Lemec, I assure you that what			the Federation wants, above all,			is the preservation of peace.					LEMEC			Ah... peace. Of course. Then how			do you explain the fact that a			Federation team launched an			unprovoked attack on Cardassian			territory less than fourteen hours			ago?  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. II" - REV. 10/19/92 - ACT ONE  7.6    CONTINUED:	Riker and Troi look surprised. Jellico keeps his	expression neutral.					JELLICO			I don't know what you're talking			about.					LEMEC			Then let me explain. Captain Jean-Luc			Picard, Lieutenant Worf, and			Doctor Beverly Crusher landed on			Celtris Three, attacked one of our			outposts in a brutal assault, and			killed over fifty-five men, women			and children.	Jellico takes a beat before responding.					JELLICO			What evidence do you have of that?					LEMEC			We have all the evidence we			need... we have Captain Picard.					RIKER			Is he alive?	Lemec lets that hang in the air for a moment, then	pointedly does not answer the question.					LEMEC			The Cardassian Union has not yet			decided how to respond to this			latest provocation.				(beat, then ominous)			But rest assured that we will			respond.	He holds Jellico's eyes for a beat, then Lemec EXITS,	followed by Corak and Tajor. Once they're out the	door, Jellico sits back in his chair... clearly this is	trouble. Riker and Troi look to him for answers. STAR TREK: "Chain of Command, Pt. II" - 10/15/92 - ACT ONE 8.6    CONTINUED: (3)					RIKER			Is there any truth to what he's			saying?	Jellico considers for a moment before answering and	then is very deliberate and careful as he answers	Riker.					JELLICO			Captain Picard and the others were			sent to... investigate reports of			a metagenic weapon on Celtris			Three. It's possible they may			have been captured.	Riker and Troi absorb this news.					JELLICO			But if they escaped, they'll head			for the Lyshan system -- the			Enterprise was supposed to meet			them there in eight hours.				(beat)			Wil, I want you to take a			shuttlecraft and head for the			rendezvous point. The Enterprise			will have to remain here until the			endgame with Gul Lemec is played			out.					RIKER			Aye, sir.	Riker EXITS.    STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. II" - REV. 10/19/92 - ACT ONE 8A-B.      6    CONTINUED: (3)					TROI			If Captain Picard has been			captured... the Cardassians will			not hesitate to use any means			available to obtain information			from him... including torture.					JELLICO			I know.				(beat)			That's why I want you to contact			Starfleet Command and inform them			they should change every security			code and protocol that Captain			Picard might have had access to.	Troi waits for something more... some indication of	concern for Picard, but none is forthcoming. She and	Jellico look at each other for a long moment.					JELLICO			That's all, Deanna.	Beat.					TROI			Aye, sir.	Troi EXITS, leaving Jellico alone. Off his troubled	face...7    INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY (OPTICAL)	A door at the far end of the chamber opens.  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. II" - REV. 10/21/92 - ACT ONE  9.7    CONTINUED: (2)	Picard, blindfolded, is escorted by two Cardassian	Guards whose footsteps echo in the large chamber. The	Guards place Picard standing in front of Gul Madred's	desk. His hands are manacled. He nods to them and	they EXIT.					MADRED			Captain Picard...					PICARD			I demand to see a neutral			representative... as required by			the Federation-Cardassian peace			treaty.					MADRED			Of course.	He removes Picard's blindfold... and Picard reacts	almost as though in pain as the light hits his dilated	pupils. Clearly he has been blindfolded for some time.	He squints and blinks as his eyes gradually adjust.					MADRED			We have already sent a message to			Tohvun Three -- the nearest			neutral planet. They assure us			they will dispatch someone			immediately.	Gul Madred walks in a circle around Picard, studying	him carefully. Picard looks tired and worn... the last	hours have not been pleasant. But he does not appear	to be under the influence of any drugs.					MADRED			I hope you're feeling better now			that the drugs have worn off.				(small shrug)			I dislike using drugs... but it is			the most efficient means of			getting information. Unless, of			course, you were given a neuro-inhibitor...			enabling you to			withhold it.					PICARD			I can't imagine what information			I have that would be meaningful to			you.	Madred smiles, doesn't reply... glances down at	Picard's hands.  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. II" - REV. 10/22/92 - ACT ONE  10.7    CONTINUED: (3)					MADRED			Please... let me remove those			restraints.	He enters a control on his PADD, then manually unsnaps	Picard's manacles. Picard involuntarily rubs his	wrists, which show deep bruises where the manacles have	cut into them. Madred gestures to a chair, as:					MADRED			I understand that you are a			student of archaeology. Did you			know that Cardassia boasts some of			the most ancient and splendid			ruins anywhere in the galaxy?	Picard sits, responds carefully... trying to understand	Madred's technique, not wanting to fall into a trap...	but knowing that conversation is the way to find his	opponent's own weaknesses -- something he knows he must	do if he is to survive.					PICARD			I know that the burial vaults of			the First Hebitian civilization			are said to be magnificent.  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. II" - REV. 10/19/92 - ACT ONE  11.7    CONTINUED: (4)					MADRED			Apparently when they were first			unearthed, two hundred years ago,			they were. The burial vaults			contained unimaginably beautiful			artifacts made of jevonite -- a			rare, breathtaking stone. But			most of those objects are gone.					PICARD			What happened to them?	Madred smiles slightly, shrugs.					MADRED			What happens to impoverished			societies... the tombs were			plundered, priceless treasures			stolen... a few were preserved in			museums... but even those were			eventually sold in order to pay			for our war efforts.					PICARD			That war cost you hundreds of			thousands of lives... depleted			your food supplies... left your			population weakened and			miserable... and yet you risk war			again.	Something in Madred's eyes burns slightly at this.					MADRED			How easy for you to judge us.			Federation planets seem to want			for nothing. But our planet is a			hardscrabble world... famine is			still a threat... it's not so easy			for us.	Picard glances around.					PICARD			And yet there seems to be enough			to maintain a well-outfitted --			and well fed -- military...					MADRED			It is the military which is the			hope of the population.  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. II" - REV. 10/16/92 - ACT ONE  12.7    CONTINUED: (5)					PICARD			The Federation would be happy to			help you feed your people --			without the need for warfare.					MADRED			Charity? I don't think so.					PICARD			Not charity... a cooperative			effort --					MADRED			Let's not waste time arguing about			issues we can't resolve. Would			you care to tour the Hebitian			burial vaults?	Picard stares at him.					MADRED			Even though they've been stripped			of funerary regalia, the tomb			paintings are extraordinary. Any			student of archaeology would be			thrilled.					PICARD				(carefully)			What I would like... is to be			returned to my ship.					MADRED			My dear Captain... you are a			criminal. You have been			apprehended invading one of our			secret facilities... the least			that will happen is for you to			stand trial and be punished.				(beat)			I am offering you the opportunity			for that experience to be --			civilized.					PICARD				(after a beat)			And the price for that			opportunity?					MADRED				(mildly)			Cooperation.	He walks away from Picard, musing.  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. II" - REV. 10/22/92 - ACT ONE  13.7    CONTINUED: (6)					MADRED			We need to know the Federation's			defense strategy for Minos Korva.					PICARD			You've injected me with drugs.			You must know that I have already			answered truthfully every question			put to me.					MADRED			Captain... we have gone to great			lengths to lure you here --			because we know that in the event			of an invasion, the Enterprise			will be the command ship for the			sector encompassing Minos Korva.					PICARD			Then it seems you have more			knowledge about the situation than			I do.	Madred stares at him for a beat, then shakes his head	sadly, taps a command into his console, and the Guards	ENTER. They pull Picard to his feet... he struggles,	having no intention of making anything easy for them.	But they are able to snap the manacles onto his wrists	again and then secure them to a bar on the ceiling.	Picard finally stands with arms stretched over his	head.  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. II" - REV. 10/22/92 - ACT ONE  14.7    CONTINUED: (7)					MADRED			Wasted energy, Captain... you			might come to wish you hadn't			expended it in such a futile			effort.	The guards EXIT.					PICARD			Torture is expressly forbidden by			the terms of the Seldonis Four			convention governing treatment of			prisoners of war.	Madred lets Picard's empty demand hang there.					MADRED			Are you in good health? Do you			have any physical ailments I			should know about?	Picard does not respond. Madred takes an object from	his desk... holds it before Picard's face. It is a	knife with a jeweled handle.					MADRED			Beautiful, isn't it? This stone			is jevonite. You can see why it			is so highly prized.	Madred begins cutting away Picard's jumpsuit. STAR TREK: "Chain of Command, Pt. II" - 10/15/92 - ACT ONE 15.7    CONTINUED: (8)					MADRED			From this point on, you will enjoy			no privileges of rank... no			privileges of person. From now			on, I will refer to you only as			"human." You have no other			identity.	Madred strips away all of the jumpsuit, leaving Picard	naked and vulnerable. We see on his upper chest a	small red scar, suggesting a recent incision.	Madred walks out of the room, his footsteps echoing.	The door closes behind him, and we hold on Picard in	the empty room for a beat.                                             FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                            STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt.

His head slumps	onto his chest occasionally as he cannot fight sleep.	Behind him, the door opens.9    ANGLE ON GUL MADRED AND GUARDS	as they ENTER the room. Madred is carrying the	Cardassian equivalent of a thermos bottle; the guards,	a robe. As the guards remove Picard from the bar on	the ceiling and put the robe on him, Madred opens the	thermos, pouring himself hot tea.					GUL MADRED			Good morning. I trust you slept			well?	The guards take Picard to the chair and then EXIT.	Madred sips his tea matter-of-factly.10thru	OMITTED1213   PICARD AND MADRED	Picard watches Madred as he drinks the tea... his own	mouth is dry and parched. He hasn't had water for a	long time. Madred is conscious of his need.					MADRED			You're thirsty?	Picard gives a slight nod.					MADRED			I would imagine so.	He caps his thermos and drains his tea. STAR TREK: "Chain of Command, Pt. II" - 10/15/92 - ACT TWO 17.13   CONTINUED:					MADRED			Well. It's time to move on.	He removes from his desk a PADD. Picard eyes it.					PICARD			I have told you what I know.					MADRED			I'm sure you have.	Madred gestures toward the ceiling (or a wall).					MADRED			How many lights do you see there?	Picard looks in the direction he is pointing.13A  ON THE LIGHT FIXTURE	There are four separate lights in the fixture.13B  RESUME SCENE	Picard turns back to Madred. He's not sure where this	is going, but he is still alert for any opportunity to	resist -- and, if possible, land a psychological blow	on his opponent.					PICARD				(guarded)			I see four lights.	Madred lifts his eyebrows... rises... and walks toward	the fixture.					MADRED			Strange... I see five.	There is a beat as he turns back to Picard.					MADRED			Are you quite sure?					PICARD			There are four lights.	Madred returns to his desk... picks up the PADD, idly	toying with it. STAR TREK: "Chain of Command, Pt. II" - 10/15/92 - ACT TWO 18.13B  CONTINUED:					MADRED			Perhaps you're aware of the			incision on your chest.	Picard's eyes drop down... his fingers move	unconsciously to the small scar.					MADRED			While you were under the influence			of our drugs, you were implanted			with a small device.				(beat)			It is a remarkable invention.				(beat)			By entering commands in this PADD,			I can produce pain in any part of			your body... at various levels of			severity.	Madred looks at Picard with genuine apology.					MADRED			Forgive me... I don't enjoy this,			but I must demonstrate. It will			make everything much clearer.	He looks down at the PADD. Picard steels himself,	trying to prepare for what is coming. Madred taps a	command and a wave of pain overtakes Picard. He gasps	and stiffens... perspiration breaks out... he puts his	knuckles to his temples and digs them in. Madred taps	the control off. Picard slumps, gasping, amazed at the	effect.					MADRED			Surprising, isn't it? Most people			feel at first that they can steel			themselves against it... but they			are completely unprepared for the			intensity of the pain.				(beat)			That was the lowest possible			setting.	Picard draws air in gasps, struggling for composure	once more.					PICARD			I... know... nothing... about			Minos Korva.	Madred glances at him, surprised.  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. II" - REV. 10/16/92 - ACT TWO  19.13B  CONTINUED: (2)					MADRED			But I've told you that I believe			you. I didn't ask about Minos			Korva...	He gestures idly at the light fixture.					MADRED			I asked you... how many lights you			see there.	Picard stares at him, realizing that the game has moved	far beyond the acquisition of information. But he is	determined to resist... as long as he is able.					PICARD			There are four lights.	Madred looks puzzled... glances at the fixtures... back	at Picard.					MADRED			I don't understand how you can be			so mistaken.13C  CLOSE ON THE PADD	as Madred's fingers enter commands. There is a cry of	pain from Picard.14   EXT.
