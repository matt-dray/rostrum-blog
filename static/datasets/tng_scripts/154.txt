Finally, just sort	of drops them off to the side. He snaps his finger	and a GYPSY VIOLIN PLAYER MATERIALIZES beside them...	startling Christy. Geordi desperately wants to find	the courage to make his move. The gypsy begins to play	romantic music.

MAIN BRIDGE	PICARD, RIKER, WORF are already at their stations as	Data ENTERS.

The sound of the signal is on the main	speaker... it is a series of rapid "blips" of sound.					DATA				(reacting to the signal)			It is an ancient interplanetary			code.					RIKER			Survivors on Orelious Nine after			all this time... not possible.					PICARD			Not at all possible.

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND THE ANCIENT WARSHIP	(OPTICAL)					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 43799.1.			We have arrived at Orelious Nine,			to chart the battle in which the			Menthars and Promellians fought			to their mutual extinction. Among			the ruins we have found a relic:			a Promellian battle cruiser that			has withstood the centuries.15   INT. CORRIDOR	Picard and Riker walking toward the Transporter Room;	Picard enthused with a spring in his step, Riker	concerned...					PICARD			Indulge me, Number One...					RIKER			I'd prefer Lieutenant Worf and			I did a security sweep of the			vessel first...					PICARD				(frowns)			No. Captain's prerogative, here.			This one's mine. We've examined			every conceivable risk...					RIKER			The risks aboard a vessel this			old and fragile are inconceivable,			Captain...					PICARD			Ghosts, perhaps?				(beat)			Haven't you ever dreamed of			climbing inside the bottle... ?					RIKER			Sir... ?       STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/5/89 - ACT ONE       7.15   CONTINUED:					PICARD			The ship in the bottle, Number			One. Model air ships... I used			to build them as a child. By God,			I'll bet I even had a Promellian			battle cruiser too.16   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	As they arrive... Worf is already waiting along with	Data.					PICARD			Ready to beam the away team to			the vessel...					O'BRIEN			Locked on to the Main Bridge,			Captain...					RIKER			You're certain about the			atmospheric conditions, Data... ?					DATA			There is adequate oxygen for life			support, Commander...					PICARD			It is exactly as they left it,			Number One. In the bottle.				(off their looks)			Good Lord, didn't anyone else here			build ships in bottles when they			were boys?					WORF			I did not play with toys.					DATA			I was never a boy.					O'BRIEN				(speaking up, filling				 the breach)			I did, sir.					PICARD				(to a compatriot)			Thank you, Mister O'Brien.			Proceed.      STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT ONE      8.16   CONTINUED:	And the child in the man has taken over his face as	his eyes shine with anticipation. The away team	DEMATERIALIZES. Riker looks at O'Brien with a cocked	eyebrow, suggesting he was stroking the captain for	points.					O'BRIEN			I did. I really did. Ships in			bottles. Great fun.	Riker gives him a little smirk and as he starts to	exit, there is a notable, brief dip in the power of the	components -- a brown out. Neither Riker or O'Brien are	overly alarmed.					RIKER			What's that?					O'BRIEN			Not sure. The secondary power			bus may need adjusting.					RIKER			Let me know.	Riker leaves the Transporter Room. O'Brien adjusts	some switches on the console.17   INT. DARKENED ANCIENT WARSHIP BRIDGE	Picard, Worf and Data move around a corner. It is	eerily still and dark... Worf lights a powerful	flashlamp.					PICARD			Extraordinary. You would expect			the layout of a bridge from this			era to be clumsy, awkward... but			see this -- it is a model of			simplicity. They built the same			craft for generations. And it			worked.	Picard wants to see everything, looks around like a kid	in a candy store. Something catches Worf's attention,	he turns...      STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/13/89 - ACT ONE      8A.17   CONTINUED:					WORF			Admirable. They died at their			posts.	And Picard and Data look at Worf's discovery -- the	skeletal remains of an ancient crewman still in his	chair, head cocked to the side in the final throes of	death.         STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - 8/31/89 - ACT ONE         9.18   INT. TEN-FORWARD	His head cocked to the side, rather like the skeleton,	Geordi downs another glass of synthehol. And he can't	quite get drunk, no matter how hard he tries...					GEORDI			Don't you have anything stronger			than this, Guinan?					GUINAN			Yes.					GEORDI			Would it help?					GUINAN			No.					GEORDI			Can you tell me something, Guinan?			You're a woman, right?					GUINAN			Yes, I can tell you that.					GEORDI			What is it that... you want in			a man?					GUINAN			Me personally?					GEORDI			As a woman. What's the first			thing you look at?					GUINAN			His head.					GEORDI			Uh huh... his mind, of course.					GUINAN			No, his head. I'm attracted to			bald men.					GEORDI			Seriously?					GUINAN			Seriously.      STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/8/89 - ACT ONE      10.18   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Why?					GUINAN			Maybe because a bald man was very			kind to me once... when I was			hurting. Took care of me.					GEORDI			I'd like to do that.					GUINAN				(not serious)			I'm taking care of myself these			days.					GEORDI			I mean take care of somebody.				(beat)			Guinan, I just don't get it...			I can field strip a fusion			reactor... I can realign a power			transfer tunnel... why can't I			make anything work with a woman			like Christy? I don't know what			to do, what to say...					GUINAN			I never noticed... as a woman.					GEORDI			You're different.					GUINAN			No, you're different.					GEORDI			But I'm not trying now.					GUINAN			Exactly.	Another customer signals Guinan and she moves away. A	beat. He shakes his head sadly. He takes another	drink.      STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT ONE      11.19   INT. ANCIENT WARSHIP	Data is patching in a small power pack... takes a few	calculations, then turns it on... dim emergency	lighting comes on. They continue their exploration...	the sound of the electronic distress signal is coming	closer as they work their way down a corridor... Worf	is recording images with a tricorder.					DATA			The source of the distress signal			is twenty meters ahead...					PICARD			Mister Worf, be sure we get			tricorder images of their tactical			display...					WORF			Yes, sir.					PICARD			Look here, Worf... how well laid			out it is. We went through how			many different designs before			we reached this kind of			sophistication... ?					DATA			I believe it was four, sir. We			did not have a fully integrated			tactical command until the			twenty-third century. In fact,			several of the Promellian			innovations served as inspiration			for early Federation starship			design...					PICARD			As well they should have.	Moving along, observing the large ducts...					PICARD			Positron ducts. These channeled			power from one end of the ship			to the other.     STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT ONE     11A.20   INT. ANCIENT WARSHIP COMMUNICATIONS ROOM	They ENTER. It is a room with several visual monitors	as well as radio and electronic equipment. The signal	beeps from a console where another skeleton has died...	Worf scans the room...					WORF			It is safe to enter.					PICARD			Let's put an end to their last			cry for help.	Worf moves to a switch on the console where a light	blinks and turns it off.					DATA			Captain...	Data has found a device that may vaguely suggest a	playback apparatus... he examines a round wire coil	that is in playback position...					DATA			I believe this is an information			storage device... a crude analogue			of our own iso-linear optical			chip.					PICARD			Crude by our standards today,			Data. When this ship was built,			humans on Earth had just perfected			the mechanical clock... and were			using steel crossbows in battle.				(examining it)			Is there any way to see what's			on this?	Data looks it over.      STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/5/89 - ACT ONE      12.20   CONTINUED:					DATA			Questionable. I can supply power			to the playback unit, Captain...			but the components are quite			old... I will attempt to amplify			its image with a tricorder...	As he goes to work...21   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Riker at command. Wes reacts to something on his	console... tries to make adjustments...					RIKER			What is it, Wes?					WESLEY			The main power return is acting			a little weird...					RIKER			Define "weird".					WESLEY			I'm getting fluctuating waveguide			readings...					RIKER			Run a maintenance sweep.					WESLEY			Right.22   INT. ANCIENT WARSHIP (OPTICAL)	Data has patched in the power. A monitor lights up...	and the wire coil begins to turn... the picture is poor	and the sound is distorted... but the image of a	Promellian commander fades in... he begins to speak....					GALEK SAR			I am Galek Sar, Captain of the			Promellian cruiser, Cleponji.			I wish anyone who finds this			record to know my crew has behaved			courageously.					(MORE)      STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT ONE      13.22   CONTINUED:					GALEK SAR (Cont'd)			I want it recorded for all time			that I, alone, am responsible for			the fate that befell us.				(a beat)			I have failed -- as a captain.			And as the man responsible for			all the souls aboard my ship.					PICARD			Indeed, sir.				(keys insignia)			Picard to Enterprise.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Go ahead, Captain.					PICARD			I think we've seen just about all			there is to see here. At Mister			O'Brien's convenience... we are			ready to return...					RIKER			Aye, sir.	On Picard's reaction...23   INT. BRIDGE	As the away team ENTERS from the turbolift... Picard	is still enthused... Riker, Wesley and TROI are on the	bridge...					PICARD			You were absolutely right, Number			One. There were ghosts aboard			the old ship after all... one of			them even spoke to us.					RIKER			A friendly one, I hope.					PICARD			My own counterpart. The ship			captain's final message...			praising his crew.     STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/13/89 - ACT ONE     13A.23   CONTINUED:					RIKER			I hope you'll be as thoughtful			when the time comes.					PICARD			Data, advise the Astral-Five annex			of the Smithsonian... This should			be catalogued and scheduled for			retrieval...	He catches Troi smiling at him... a look, what?					TROI			I'm sorry... it's just a rare			pleasure to meet this side of your			personality, Captain.	Picard grunts, doesn't like allowing his feelings to	show. Sits in his command post. Tries to pull it in.      STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/5/89 - ACT ONE      14.23   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(gruff)			Mister Crusher, set our course			for the original coordinates.					WESLEY			Yessir.	People move quickly... there is a slight dip of energy	and a flutter in the light panels... they react...					DATA			Captain, we are experiencing a two			percent drop in our energy			reserves. Compensating.					RIKER				(to Picard)			We were having a few problems			while...	An alarm goes off on Worf's panel.					WORF				(concerned)			Readouts indicate we are being			bombarded with a field of high			intensity radiation.					RIKER			Shields up.	Another dip in energy. Picard and Riker exchange a	curious look.					DATA			Captain, energy loss increasing			to five percent. I am unable to			correct.					PICARD			Yellow Alert.24   INT. TEN-FORWARD	Geordi with Guinan...      STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/5/89 - ACT ONE      15.24   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Maybe I should've gone with the			Mardi Gras program... something			a little livelier...					GUINAN			You ever consider doing it			without a program?	Geordi lets that sink in a beat...					GUINAN			You're a pilot... Try flying			without instruments for a			change... you might surprise			yourself.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Mister La Forge, report to			Engineering...	And Geordi sits up, focuses...					GEORDI			On my way, Commander.	He's on his feet, alive again, clears his head...					GEORDI			Save my seat, Guinan.	He's gone.					GUINAN				(to herself)			Always room at the bar for another			broken heart.25   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	As before.					DATA			Energy loss increasing.					PICARD			Mister Crusher, reverse course.			Full impulse power.					WESLEY			Sir, there's no response.      STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/1/89 - ACT ONE      15A.25   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Increase speed to warp one.					WESLEY			Engines are not responding, sir.					RIKER			Mister La Forge, I need warp power			now!      STAR TREK: "Booby Trap" - REV. 9/5/89 - ACT ONE      16.26   INT.
