BRIDGE	PICARD, RIKER, WORF, DATA, SUPERNUMERARIES, and several	J'naii, including SOREN and KRITE. The J'naii are a	genderless species; Soren and Krite, like the others,	possess no demonstrable sexual characteristics. All	the J'naii look remarkably alike: strikingly	attractive, with lithe, slim bodies and chiseled,	delicate features. Soren is near Riker; Krite at an	aft station.					DATA			We are approaching the designated			coordinates, Captain.					PICARD			On screen.2A   ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	It shows the starfield -- no sign of a shuttlecraft.					PICARD			Long-range scan, Mister Data.	Data enters commands.					DATA			Sensors find no evidence of the			shuttle anywhere within the star			system.         STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - TEASER         2.2A   CONTINUED:					SOREN			It couldn't have travelled outside			the system.					RIKER			Mister Data, reconfigure for a			high-resolution sweep with a			radius of one million kilometers.			Look for possible debris.	Data works controls once more.					DATA			Scan shows no debris within			that radius.					KRITE			I don't understand it.

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around a blue-green planet.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, supplemental. The			sudden disappearance of our probe			suggests that we may have found			the first instance of what is			called null space -- an anomaly			which until now had been only			theoretical. Commander Riker has			been working around the clock with			a team of J'naii specialists to			formalize this hypothesis.4    INT. J'NAII CIVIC CHAMBER - DAY (OPTICAL)	Riker, Soren, Krite, NOOR (head of government), and	other J'naii leaders are gathered to discuss the	situation. The room is not huge -- just larger than	the observation lounge.	Soren and Riker are standing near a monitor in the	wall, upon which an Okudagram illustrates the gases	and vapors that swirl into the formation of a star.					SOREN			During the creation of a star			system, when clouds of			interstellar dust and gas			coalesce... turbulent regions of			magnetic and gravitational fields			may develop.	The monitor reflects this, showing dense fields of	disturbance.					SOREN			If certain conditions occur,			these fields can condense into			abnormal pockets of space.	Soren turns and glances at Riker. He and Soren have	been working together on this project, and there's	already an easy familiarity between them.      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      6.4    CONTINUED:					RIKER			We think your system contains one			of these null pockets.	Riker pushes controls and the monitor shows a star	system in which one section, or "pocket" is	significantly different from the space surrounding it.	Riker points to it.					RIKER			If we're right, this pocket would			absorb electromagnetic energy from			anything that entered it...					SOREN			Like a shuttlecraft.					RIKER			Or a probe. Making them			powerless.					SOREN			But outside the pocket, all energy			is bent around it -- making it			naturally cloaked. That's why			we can't see it, and sensors don't			read it.					NOOR			Is the shuttle still there?					RIKER			We think so. The ship probably			couldn't sustain its power...			but other than that it wouldn't			be damaged.					SOREN			Since our shuttles carry			plestorene-based backup systems,			we think life support would			sustain for as long as ten days.      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      7.4    CONTINUED: (2)					NOOR			Then perhaps our crew has			survived...					RIKER			We can send one of our shuttles			into the null space -- but its			energy output would be absorbed			as well. Our chief engineer is			working on a way to maintain the			power reserves long enough to			rescue your crew.					NOOR			Commander... we're grateful for			your help.				(rising)			Whatever resources we can provide			are yours.	Noor heads for the door, followed by the others.	Riker turns to Soren.					SOREN			I've been thinking... when the			time comes, I'd like to pilot the			shuttle.	Riker is a little surprised at this.					RIKER			It's a Starfleet craft...					SOREN			I can't ask you to put yourself			in danger to rescue our crew.					RIKER			You can't pilot a shuttle you're			not familiar with.	Soren hesitates, realizing the truth of what he's	saying... but not wanting to give up.        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE        7A.4    CONTINUED: (3)					SOREN			I happen to be a good pilot...	A beat.					RIKER			I happen to be a good pilot, too.			I also know my way around			Starfleet shuttles. So... what			if we team up?	Soren considers, looks at him, smiles.					SOREN			When can we go over your shuttle			flight operations?					RIKER			Right now.	And he gestures Soren out of the room.      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      8.5    INT. SHUTTLE BAY	Riker and Soren walk around the shuttlecraft.					RIKER			It's a short-range craft... with			two twelve-hundred fifty			millicochrane warp engines...					SOREN			Looks like microfusion			thrusters...					RIKER			Right.					SOREN			Armament?					RIKER			Usually none. But it's been			fitted with two type-four phaser			emitters... we'll use them to			chart the null space.					SOREN				(puzzled)			Chart it?					RIKER			Commander La Forge wants to get			an idea of how big this pocket			is. He thinks the rate of energy			absorption will be linked to its			size.					SOREN			I'm not sure how we go about			mapping something we can't see...					RIKER			That's where the emitters come			in. We'll shoot a series of			photon pulses into the pocket and			chart the points where they			disappear. We should be able to			plot a fairly complete outline			that way.	Soren gives him a look and smiles, nodding. She turns	to ENTER the shuttle.      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      9.5    CONTINUED:					SOREN			Let's take a look at the controls.	Soren enters the shuttlecraft, followed by Riker.5A   INT. SHUTTLE	They sit at the controls.					RIKER			Maybe later we can try a flight			simulation, but first let's do			a systems review.				(taps controls)			I'll walk you through it...	Soren gives him a quick look, puts hands on the	controls.      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      10.5B   CLOSE ON MONITOR (OPTICAL)	The monitor on the panel jumps to life, scrolling	through a systems review.5C   BACK TO SCENE					SOREN			Propulsion system... transfer			conduits... where's the schematic			of the reactor assembly? Oh,			there it is... engine nacelles...	She looks over at Riker, who is watching her go through	the review at top speed.					SOREN			There's nothing here that's			unfamiliar.	She continues manipulating the console like a pro.					SOREN			Navigational deflector...			redundant graviton polarity source			generators...	Riker is watching in admiration.					RIKER			You're handling those controls			like you grew up in a shuttle...					SOREN			I did. My parents were pilots.			I started flying with them before			I could walk. And as soon as I			was old enough, I entered flight			school. Krite was my instructor.					RIKER			He had a good student.      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      11.5C   CONTINUED:	Soren looks at him, coolly amused.					SOREN			"He?" Commander, there are no			"he's" or "she's" in a species			without gender.	Riker grins, throws up his hands.					RIKER			Okay. For two days I've been			trying to construct sentences			without personal pronouns. I give			up... what should I say? "It?"			To us, that's almost rude.					SOREN			We use a pronoun which is neutral.			But it doesn't really have a			translation.					RIKER				(good-naturedly)			Then I'll just have to muddle			through... so be tolerant if a			stray "he" or "she" slips by,			okay?	Soren smiles at him and they work for a beat more.					SOREN			Well, if that's the systems			review, I don't see any problems			here. What's next?	Riker smiles in admiration for this quick study.					RIKER			Lunch.	Soren looks at him. Smiles.6thru	OMITTED78    INT. TEN FORWARD	Riker at a table with Soren. In the background, beyond	them, is a couple in intimate conversation, heads	close. We will see them later. A waiter has just set	bowls of soup on Riker's table.        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE        12.8    CONTINUED:	Soren peers down at it, puzzled.					SOREN			What is it?					RIKER			Split pea soup. My father's			recipe. I had it programmed into			the replicators.	Soren takes a spoonful, touches her tongue to it.	(NOTE: From this point on, for the sake of	convenience, feminine pronouns will be used in	reference to Soren.) She tastes it, is not displeased,	takes a little more.					RIKER			Well?					SOREN			Unusual... but I think I like			it...					RIKER			It's very healthy. Helps keep			you warm on a cold Alaskan night.					SOREN			We prefer to stay warm by sleeping			with a friend.	The statement is startling in its casualness. Riker	looks at her, taken aback.					RIKER			I see...					SOREN				(explaining)			Not to mate... just to sleep			together. For warmth.					RIKER			Sounds better than pea soup.	Soren gives him a direct, penetrating look.					SOREN			We are puzzling to you, aren't			we?        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE        13.8    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			A little. It's hard to grasp the			idea of having no gender...					SOREN			It's just as hard for us to			understand the strange division			you have in your species... males			and females.	Riker can't help but smile. Soren's gaze drifts to	the couple in the corner, who are being openly	affectionate with each other.					SOREN			You... are male.	Riker nods, not certain where this is leading.					SOREN			Tell me... about males. What is			it that makes you different from			females?	A tall order. Riker considers.					RIKER			Snips and snails and puppy dog's			tails...	She stares at him, dumbfounded.					SOREN			You have a dog's tail?					RIKER				(laughing)			That's an old nursery rhyme.			Girls are made of sugar and spice.			Boys are made of snips and			snails...      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      14.8    CONTINUED: (3)					SOREN			That makes it sound better to be			female.					RIKER			It's an old fashioned way of			looking at the sexes. Not to say			that there aren't real			differences. Physically, men tend			to be bigger... stronger in the			upper body. We have different			sexual organs. Men don't bear			young...					SOREN			What about... feelings? Emotional			attitudes? Are they different?					RIKER			Well... most people think so.			But that's the kind of question			that might take an hour or two			to answer.	She smiles and glances again at the affectionate	couple.					RIKER			Let me ask you...				(struggling a bit)			What's it like... on a planet where			the people have no gender?	She gives him a curious look.					SOREN			I'm afraid I don't understand.					RIKER			Well... who leads when you dance?			If you dance...					SOREN			We do... and... whoever's taller			leads.	She gives him a direct look, and he can't tell whether	she's kidding or not. He keeps it in a playful mode.					RIKER			Without the "battle of the			sexes"... you probably don't			have as many arguments...     STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE     14A.8    CONTINUED: (4)	She regards him with amusement.					SOREN			Just because we don't have gender			doesn't mean we don't have			conflict. We're very strong-			minded... we love a good fight.	He eyes her, taken by her wit and her forthrightness.					RIKER			Sounds like there aren't that			many differences between your			species and mine...	She smiles, looking directly at him.					SOREN			Maybe not.	Soren hesitates only briefly before the next question,	which she asks casually.					SOREN			What kind of woman do you find			attractive?	Riker gives her a slight look, wondering where this	questioning is coming from.					RIKER			I like a woman who's intelligent			and sure of herself... somebody			I can talk to and get something			back.				(beat)			But the most important thing of			all -- she has to laugh at my			jokes.        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE        15.8    CONTINUED: (5)	Soren does.					SOREN			And is that the kind of woman all			human males prefer?					RIKER			Not at all. Some men like quiet,			demure women... others prefer a			lot of energy... some respond only			to physical attractiveness...			others couldn't care less. There			aren't any rules.	She smiles at him. Her eyes flicker over to the	couple, who exchange a brief kiss.					SOREN			You make it sound very complex.					RIKER			Believe me -- it is.	Soren looks into his eyes. A subtle but unmistakable	change comes over her... the look is seductive. Her	voice takes on a sensuous tone.					SOREN			Perhaps it is that complexity...			which makes differences in the			sexes... so interesting.	She smiles at him, leaning forward slightly, waiting	for a response. Riker is taken aback. He stares at	her, not sure how to respond. He is rescued from the	dilemma by the arrival of Krite, who approaches the	table from behind Soren.					KRITE			Good evening, Commander.					RIKER			Good evening.					SOREN				(rising)			Please take my place, Krite. I			have to be going.	Riker looks up at her; she has undergone another	transformation. Gone is the seductiveness, the	alluring voice, the pliant body language. She is erect	and formal -- a typical J'naii.        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE        15A.8    CONTINUED: (6)					SOREN			Thank you for going over the			flight protocols, Commander. It's			been very helpful.	And she walks away, Riker looking after her, puzzled.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO      16.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:10   EXT.
