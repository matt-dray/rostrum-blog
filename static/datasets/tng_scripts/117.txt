SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - VELARA III IN B.G.	The ship is ENTERING a parking orbit of the	yellow-ochre, featureless planet.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 41463.9.			We are mapping the Pleiades			Cluster which has many young			planets and we've been asked by			the Federation to visit a group			terraforming Velara III, which			we would very much like to see.			Communications have been erratic			and there is some concern about			their welfare.2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	PICARD, RIKER, DATA, TROI, TASHA, GEORDI and WORF --	at their respective stations -- all study Velara III	on the Main Viewer. As Velara III SETTLES INTO PLACE	on the Main Viewer:					GEORDI			Entering standard orbit -- now.					PICARD			It takes special people to live			in such desolation.					TROI			Visionaries, who don't see this			planet as it is, but as it will			be.					RIKER			I've always wanted to see			terraforming in operation.					PICARD			Hailing frequency, Lieutenant Yar.          STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:					TASHA			Hailing frequencies open, sir.					PICARD			Velara III base, this is Captain			Picard of the starship Enterprise.	No response.					PICARD				(continuing)			Lieutenant Yar... ?					TASHA			No equipment malfunction on either			end, sir. They are receiving.					PICARD			Velara III, this is the Enterprise.			Come in please.	Still nothing. Some tense glances among personnel.					GEORDI				(after a beat)			Maybe nobody's home.3    ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	ZOOM IN until WE CAN MAKE OUT the ribbed dome of the	Terraforming Station.					DATA			We are sensing life-forms, sir.					PICARD				(concerned)			Velara III, do you copy?	Then the IMAGE of PROJECT DIRECTOR KURT MANDL APPEARS,	somewhat disheveled. He is Picard's age, and appears	to be taken off guard. He could be of German decent,	somewhat stiff.					MANDL			Velara Base to Enterprise. Uh...			yes, Captain. Director Mandl			here. Sorry for the delay. We			weren't expecting visitors.          STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - TEASER          3.4    ANGLE ON TROI	just enough to ESTABLISH that a small alarm bell is	ringing, but not enough for a comment.5    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)					PICARD			Terraform Command has asked us			to see how you were getting along.					MANDL			... We were a little behind, but			we're back on schedule.6    CLOSE ON TROI AND PICARD	watching and listening intently.					TROI				(quietly)			We alarm him for some reason.					PICARD				(a pause)			Your staff is all well, I presume,			Director?					MANDL			Understandably tired. We're all			working very hard, Captain.					PICARD			Is there anything we can do to			help?... You and your staff are			welcome aboard for a change of			scene and some rest. We have some			Holodecks you might enjoy.					MANDL			No disrespect, sir, we can't			afford to take the time.	Troi touches Picard, indicating he should CLICK OFF.	Picard DOES SO.					TROI			His fear is escalating.          STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - TEASER          4.6    CONTINUED:					MANDL			If you'll excuse me, I must get			back to work.					TROI			I sense deliberate concealment,			sir.	Picard takes it in, concerned.7    FEATURING PICARD -- INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	While Picard delivers the following, Mandl seems	distracted.					PICARD				(to Troi)			Of what?					TROI			I don't know, but it's intense.	Picard nods and CLICKS BACK ON.					PICARD			We've heard so much about your			remarkable achievements in			terraforming, that my staff would			very much appreciate looking			around.					MANDL				(hesitant)			... It's not really the best time.			We are at a critical phase just			now.					PICARD			We do not require any special			attention.					MANDL				(softer)			I'm trying not to be rude, sir,			but it would be inconvenient just			now.	Pause. Troi signals Picard to CLICK OFF again.          STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - TEASER          5.7    CONTINUED:					TROI			He's concealing something and it's			more than just being too busy.			Your announcement about coming			down has pushed him almost to the			point of panic.					PICARD			Whether he wants us or not...				(touching his com)			Director Mandl, unless you are			absolutely refusing permission			for us to land on your station,			please prepare to receive my			away team.					MANDL				(curtly)			As you wish.	Riker, Tasha, Data and Geordi rise and head for the	door. Worf and another crewmember replace Data and	Geordi.					PICARD			Stay on your toes, Number One.			Counselor, perhaps you should go			along. A man this tense is			unpredictable.	Troi rises and JOINS the away team.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE         6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:8    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit.9    INT. TERRAFORMING BASE (OPTICAL)	Riker, Data, Geordi, Troi and Tasha BEAM IN.	Present in the room are ARTHUR MALENCON, LUISA KIM	and BJORN BENSEN, Hydraulics Specialist, Biosphere	Designer and Chief Engineer, respectively. Expecting	the visitors, Malencon, and Bensen are guarded. Luisa	on the other hand is friendly and open.					LUISA			Welcome to Velara III. Remember			it as it is now, because in a			couple of decades you won't recognize			the place.				(steps foward)			Luisa Kim. Gardener of Edens.					RIKER			Commander William Riker, USS			Enterprise. This is Lieutenant			Commander Data, Counselor Troi,			Lieutenant Yar and Lieutenant			La Forge.	The other two members of the terraforming team	reluctantly move forward -- both are tense.					LUISA			This is Bjorn Bensen, Chief			Engineer, and Arthur Malencon,			our Hydraulics Specialist,	Bensen steps over to Data. He looks him over.					BENSON			An android.	Data nods.					TASHA			And third in command of the			Enterprise.         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE         7.9    CONTINUED:	After a look of suprise, Bensen takes Data's offered	hand and examines both sides of it, as if he's checking	out a new piece of remarkable equipment.					BENSEN			Where were you manufactured --			are there others like you?					DATA			Both matters are subjects of			protracted discussion.					BENSEN			Remarkable.	Bensen turns and joins Malencon at their work. The	team members take in their surroundings. We are in a	twenty-fourth century power and hydraulics facility, more	square-cut and mechanical than the Enterprise. Large,	working machinery, on which "the bolts show." The	computers are more heavy duty and their jumper cables	show. This room is the hub of the operation, with	corridors and doors leading off in four different	directions. Beneath it all is the LOW RUMBLE of	HYDRAULIC EQUIPMENT at work.					LUISA			We don't get visitors. It's			exciting to have you here.					RIKER			We weren't sure how we would be			received. Director Mandl seemed			less than enthusiastic about our			interest.					LUISA				(warmly)			I should apologize for him. We			are at a critical phase. Usually			he's quite charming.	Riker returns her smile.					RIKER			We'll stay out of your way, it's			just that we've never seen a			terraforming station, and couldn't			resist the opportunity.         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE         8.9    CONTINUED: (2)					LUISA			How much do you know about the			process?					DATA			The theories -- the reports -- but			nothing firsthand.					LUISA			Oh, wonderful. Then let me show			you around.	As she turns and leads them to a screen, Troi moves	to Riker.					TROI				(sotto voce)			The other two are as veiled and			secretive as Mandl, but she is			not.10   ANGLE TO INCLUDE LUISA'S SCREEN (OPTICAL)	As the away team watches, the screen SHOWS a lifeless,	uniformly brown, dead planet.					LUISA			What we're doing is so exciting,			so -- inspiring. We take a			lifeless planet and little by			little transform it into an			M-class environment, capable of			supporting life. Terraforming			makes you feel a little godlike.				(beat)			Is that a terribly arrogant thing			to say?					DATA			Not at all. It is accurate.11   INTERCUT	with REACTIONS and COMMENTS of the away team. During	this, Luisa seems attracted to Riker.         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE         9.11   CONTINUED:					LUISA			The first phase is selecting the			planet. That's very important.			It must have the right mass and			gravity, the correct rate of			rotation, and a balanced day and			night. The planet must also be			without life or having the			prospect of life delveloping			naturally. The Federation makes			that decision. Then...				(she pauses a beat for				 emphasis)			... we take over.	Riker and the others are taken by her ingenuous	enthusiasm.					LUISA				(continuing)			What you see here -- this station			-- is Phase Two. Phase Three			involves the water. Usually we			create basins, using hydraulic			landscaping, but the water on			this planet is subsurface, and			extremely high in salt content.			We are just about to begin pumping			and filtering that water,			removing the salt, oxygenating			and replacing. Next we introduce			micro-organisms, and when the			process is complete...	Her screen now SHOWS several large separated areas of	green. The away team exchange looks of admiration.					LUISA				(continuing)			... eventually, we'll have a			lush, arable, biosphere.	While this goes on, Data's attention is caught by	Malencon.					RIKER			You make it sound poetic.					LUISA				(brightly)			I think it's the best occupation			in the universe.         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE         10.11   CONTINUED: (2)	Data CROSSES to Malencon's work station and glances at	his blueprints.12   ANGLE - DATA AND MALENCON	Malencon is working near a computer screen FILLED with	hydraulics plans -- pipes, sprayers, probes, plans for	channels, rivers and bays. Geordi STEPS UP beside him.					DATA			The efficiency of your hydraulic			landscaping is elegant.	How could Malencon not be flattered?					MALENCON			It isn't yet -- but it will be.			Right now, I'm disturbed by			erratic power surges in several			of the servomechanisms that			control the hydraulic probes.					GEORDI			Could it be the increased			conductivity caused by the high			saline content?					MALENCON				(with the enthusiasm				 of one scientist to				 another)			That was my first thought, but..	Bensen puts a cap on the conversation.					BENSEN			Arthur.	Malencon catches himself.					BENSEN				(continuing; curtly)			We checked that out. That wasn't			it.13   TROI AND RIKER	They exchange a glance at this behavior.         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE         11.14   ANOTHER ANGLE	as Mandl ENTERS the room.					MANDL			I'm Director Mandl. I am sorry			about being so abrupt during our			initial contact, being isolated			one tends to forget the social			graces. Are you seeing everything			you want?					TROI			What you are doing here is			miraculous.					MANDL			What we are doing here is working			on a difficult, demanding			timetable, and there will be no			miracle unless Malencon gets the			hydraulic probes back on line.			We are set to step up to full			conversion, immediately.				(crisply; to Malencon)			Shouldn't you be in the hydraulics			chamber, Arthur?	Malencon is caught off guard.					MALENCON			Now?15   TROI	She picks up on the tension.16   MANDL	He steps toward Malencon for emphasis.					MANDL			Yes.					MALENCON				(rising, nervous)			All right, Kurt.	Malencon HURRIES OUT.         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE         12.17   ANOTHER ANGLE	Troi and Riker exchange a glance at this behavior.18   GEORDI	indicating Malencon's computer screen.					GEORDI			That must be the master subsurface			pump. Impressive.					DATA				(indicating another area				 on the computer screen)			This is interesting. How the			water table is a thin ribbon			between the sandy surface layer			and the rock below.					GEORDI			And it follows the contour precisely.					DATA				(nodding)			Which would require extreme			precision from the probe controls.	Mandl ENTERS SHOT, on guard as he hears this. He goes	to the computer and calls up another program.					MANDL			Here's something which should			interest you. The vegetation			graphs are really the key element			to successful terraforming.	CAMERA BACK as everyone steps closer to look, except	Troi.					RIKER			Incredible. It's planned month			by month, decade by decade.					MANDL			Every single thing we do is			specific and exacting. You see			grand, romantic concepts. I see			unyielding rock under an ocean			of sand.         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE         13.19   ANGLE - TROI	She suddenly registers a severe emotional shock.					TROI				(overlapping, alarmed)			Commander... !	as all hear the alarm in her voice. Her internal	sensors are scanning the facility.					RIKER			What is it, Deanna?	Her face suddenly registers emotional shock.					TROI				(almost in pain)			Malencon. He's in trouble.	A perception immediately followed by a WARNING SIREN	and the o.s. SOUND of LASER BLASTS. Reactions. Riker	is first OUT of the room, FOLLOWED by Data, Geordi and	Tasha. Mandl is NEXT, FOLLOWED by Troi. Bensen and	Luisa, exchanging a look, BRING UP THE REAR.20   INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE HYDRAULICS ROOM	The o.s. LASER BLASTING is LOUDER, accompanied by	SHOUTS and CRIES of PAIN by Malencon on the other side	of the closed door. ANGLE ADJUSTS as Riker and the	group CONVERGE ON the sliding door. Riker tries the	handle -- locked. He alone... and then he and Data pull	at the handles -- no go. Mandl SQUEEZES UP.					RIKER			Can you open it?	Mandl presses the auto-decoder pad, tries the door.	But it still won't open.					MANDL			It's jammed.					TASHA			Let me try.	The o.s. SCREAMS STOP. The LASER BLASTS CEASE.	Reactions: "Is the threat over?" Troi looks sad.					TROI			We're too late.	Mandl tries the auto-decoder pad again, and this time	the door OPENS.         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE         14.21   INT. HYDRAULICS ROOM - MANDL'S POV	The central monitoring column, from which laser arms	extend and sink laterally into the "surround," has been	trashed. On the floor is the equally trashed body of	Arthur Malencon.22   REVERSE ANGLE	as folks CROWD INTO the doorway. Mandl has a look of	fear etched across his face. Luisa, very emotional,	covers her eyes, turns away. Bensen is sick. Our away	team looks from the body on the floor to Mandl back to	the body. Tasha stares at Mandl.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                   STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT TWO         15.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:23   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	In orbit.					PICARD (V. O.)			Captain's log, supplemental. What			began as a routine visit to the			Federation group terraforming			Velara III has become a serious			situation. Arthur Malencon, the			hydraulics engineer, has been			killed in an extraordinary			accident.24   INT. TERRAFORMING BASE - HYDRAULICS ROOM	as before, with Malencon's body. PAN the mess of	twisted metal until WE SETTLE on the doorway where Data	waits with the others, except for Geordi and Bensen.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Situation report, Number One.					RIKER				(tense, trying to save				 a life)			For safety reasons, we're shutting			off all power to the hydraulics			room before entering to recover			the body. Then we'll beam him			up to Sickbay, but from the look			of his wounds, it's probably			hopeless.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Keep me informed.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Data... ?	Data taps his communicator.					DATA			Go ahead, Geordi.         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT TWO         16.25   INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM/HYDRAULICS ROOM	(INTERCUT AS DESIRED)	Geordi stands before an array of computer panels	examining a display SHOWING the FLOW CHART of the	operation, AND a DIAGRAM OF THE CROSSED-HUB LAYOUT as	Bensen works some controls, then nods to Geordi.					BENSEN			All set.					GEORDI			We have your section powered down			now. Bensen has locked the master			servomotor drive system. It			should be safe in there now.					TASHA			I'm going in.					DATA			I will go with you.	Data and Tasha ENTER the room, moving to Malencon's	body. She quickly affixes a communicator to the body,	touches it, says:26   CLOSE ON TASHA AND BODY (OPTICAL)					TASHA			Transporter Room, this is			Lieutenant Yar. Two to beam up			to Sickbay.	Concerned to get the body to Sickbay as soon as	possible, she waits as she and the body DEMATERIALIZE.27   BACK TO DOORWAY (OPTICAL)					LUISA			I want to go. We should be with			him.				(to Mandl)			Kurt, please come too.	Mandl shows reluctance, but, seeing the looks on	everyone's faces, he acquiesces. Riker touches his	com.         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT TWO         17.27   CONTINUED:					RIKER			Transporter Room, this is			Commander Riker. Beam up four			at my coordinates.	Luisa, Mandl, Troi and Riker DEMATERIALIZE. Data now	moves into the room proper, prying his way through the	wreckage.					DATA				(on com)			I have seen malfunctions, but			this is unprecedented. Almost			as if the laser drill attempted			to tear itself apart.					BENSEN				(off Geordi's look)			I can't explain it.					DATA				(into com; reflecting)			The laser blasts seemed to end			when the yelling stopped.	Data goes to the room's computer control console.					BENSEN'S COM VOICE			Maybe Arthur stopped it -- only			not in time.					DATA			Not possible.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Then what are you suggesting?	Data studies at the control panel.					DATA			Uncertain.				(to Geordi)			Geordi, would you please return			power to the control console in			this room. I want to reactivate			the program.	Geordi and Bensen do as requested, systematically	toggling a bank of switches. (END INTERCUT)         STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT TWO         18.28   DATA'S ANGLE - CONSOLE	A localized panel LIGHTS UP. Data pushes buttons. The	laser drill begins its normal functioning. Data	watches it for a beat as it systematically blasts into	the bore holes. He then turns his attention back to	the console.					DATA				(into com)			I am running the base drilling			program.29   ANGLES - VARIOUS (MECHANICAL EFFECTS) (OPTICAL)	While Data is preoccupied with the computer program,	the firing head on the laser drill, lifts and turns	-- no longer sighting down the bore holes -- it is now	taking dead aim on Data.

A TIRADE	BEGINS, clumsy at first, but unmistakably angry.	INTERCUT REACTIONS.					TRANSLATOR VOICE			Ugly... Ugly... Giants... Bags			of Mostly Water...					PICARD			Bags of mostly water?					DATA			An accurate description, sir, of			humans.

We come in			peace.					TRANSLATOR VOICE			Ugly Bag of Mostly Water... we try			at peace... you still not listen.				(getting clearer)			Bag in Dome on Sand of Home...			we killed.        STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT FOUR        42.76   CONTINUED:					RIKER			It killed Malencon.					TROI				(telepathically)			We see and hear you now. We			didn't know you were there. You			are beautiful to us. All life is			beautiful.					TRANSLATOR VOICE			Bag in dome did know. Made some			of us die. Made us kill.

There is a LIGHT FLICKER from the	life-form as:					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			... biologically and			psychologically difficult for			us to fully understand.				(beat)			The only thing totally clear is			that this microbrain, as we've			come to call it, has declared war			on us.81   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLES (FORMERLY SCENE 83)	Everyone at their stations.					RIKER			Their range of influence appears			to be concentrated in the Medical			Lab, Captain.					TASHA			All non-essential personnel have			been moved to the most distant			areas of the ship, sir.					PICARD			Data -- any analysis of those			bolts of light they emit?        STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE        45.81   CONTINUED:					DATA			That seems to be their method of			reprogramming, Captain. Each bolt			of light consists of negatively			and positively charged ions. A			series of program instructions,			as it were.				(disturbed)			They seem to have a quicker			rapport with our computers than			we do.					WORF			What do you expect? They are			computers.					PICARD			Have we disabled the Medical Lab			computer console?					RIKER			Aye, sir, as soon as Data			determined the microbrain's method			of operation.82   OMITTED82A  ANGLE	on Geordi and his console.

WE GET the SOUND OF THE	TRANSPORTER. The BEAM even COMES PART WAY toward the	bell jar and its microbrain occupant. But the damn	thing won't dematerialize.87   NEW ANGLE	EXCLUDING the viewscreen. Riker reads a console.					RIKER			Transporter power has been			redirected, sir. We are unable			to affect it.        STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE        47.87   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Life-form or not... intelligent			or not -- the safety of this ship			and all on her are my primary			responsibility.				(moment, and:)			Data -- evacuate the air from the			Medical Lab. I want a vacuum in			there.	Data punches in the command... reads his panel.					DATA			Environmental systems fail to			respond to commands, Captain.			It appears the microbrain has			successfully interfaced with our			computer.	Picard considers his alternatives.					PICARD			Suggestions?				(silence)			Anyone?88   OMITTED88A  INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - ESTABLISHING	(FORMERLY SCENES 81 AND 82)	Picard, Data and Beverly are with Mandl, Luisa, and	Bensen. The lounge viewscreen will eventually put	referenced IMAGES ON A SCREEN.					PICARD			I need your help. We have			communicated with the life-form			discovered on Velara III.					MANDL			You have what?!					PICARD			It has told us that it attempted			to communicate with you, and you			ignored it.					MANDL			If it was trying to communicate			with us, we didn't understand			that.        STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE        48.88A  CONTINUED:					BENSEN			We didn't try.					PICARD			What you were doing was so			threatening to them that they			killed your hydraulics engineer			to stop it. They have declared			a state of war.					MANDL			A state of war?!					PICARD			Yes, and we're on the defensive.			I need your help. I have to find			some way to fight them. We no			longer have control of the Medical			Lab, or the computer. At this			moment they have the power to			destroy this ship and everyone			on it.					MANDL			Unbelievable. What can we do			to help?					PICARD			They said you killed some of them.			I need to know how.					MANDL			I -- I don't know.					PICARD			Exactly what was Malencon doing			when he was killed?	Luisa responds.					LUISA			There is a very thin layer of			highly saline water under the			sandy topsoil. He was siphoning			that off.					PICARD			Why would that kill some of them?	For a beat no one has an answer.					BEVERLY			Liquid supports life. Perhaps			somehow, that saline water			sustained them.             STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE            49.88A  CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			It connected them.					LUISA			I don't understand.					BEVERLY			The microbrains are like our brain			cells. Individually a cell has			life -- but not intelligence -- yet			when interconnected their combined			intelligence is formidable.					LUISA			So that saline fluid is their			circuitry.					PICARD			And to prevent its loss, they			killed Malencon.					LUISA				(depressed)			If we had continued to remove the			water... we would have destroyed			them all.					PICARD			Reason enough for anyone to go			to war.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Captain -- it's happening again!89   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	PULL BACK from Main Viewer to SEE the recently dormant	GOLF BALL starting to GLOW again. The GLOW is STEADY	and POWERFUL. WE ALSO SEE A QUIVERING of the surface.	But then the entire image is SHROUDED in LIGHT,	OBSCURING OUR VIEW. The bell jar suddenly RUPTURES.	The LIGHT DIMINISHES. Everyone is at their stations.	Luisa, Bensen and Mandl are also present.					RIKER			If this keeps up, that thing will			tear the Enterprise apart!             STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE            50.89   CONTINUED:					DATA			Captain -- sensors indicate the			microbrain expends a tremendous			amount of energy during its			reproduction cycle. Yet, there			is no discernible power drain from			our own systems.					PICARD			Then what's feeding the damn			thing!?					GEORDI			Data and I found traces of			cadmium salts. Cadmium is a			conduit for converting infra-red			into electricity.					PICARD			Meaning?					DATA			Meaning the microbrains might be			photoelectric.					PICARD			Okay, let's see if darkness will			neutralize them. Kill the lights			in the lab, Mr. La Forge. We can			at least do that.	Geordi tries, but to no avail.					GEORDI			Sorry, Captain, can't do it by			remote.					PICARD			Number One...	He's already dashing to the turbolift.					RIKER			On my way.	Riker EXITS. Luisa, eyes on the Main Viewer, moves	close to Picard. As much to herself as to him:             STAR TREK: "Home Soil" - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE            51.89   CONTINUED: (2)					LUISA				(seeing it all now)			The creatures must have evolved			at that narrow layer where the			light got through the sand to the			water...
