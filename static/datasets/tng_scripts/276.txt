Meanwhile, we			are celebrating the return of an			old friend.2    INT. TEN FORWARD	where a reception is in progress for RO LAREN --	there's a buffet table, drinks, and some quiet music in	the background.	Everyone's excited about seeing Ro, and when she	ENTERS, she is approached by TROI, BEVERLY and GEORDI.	She's not entirely comfortable about the fuss that's	being made over her.					BEVERLY			Welcome home.					RO			Thanks. It's good to be back.	Troi gestures to Ro's new collar pip.					TROI			Congratulations on your promotion --			Lieutenant.	And Ro returns the gesture --					RO			Same to you -- Commander.					TROI			Thank you.					GEORDI				(teasing)			I hear Advanced Tactical Training			is a real picnic...   STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - TEASER   2.2    CONTINUED:	Geordi is obviously teasing her in order to give her	the chance to tell them something about what she's been	up to, but Ro just smiles wryly at his comment.					RO			Right...	There's a slight lull in the conversation.					BEVERLY			Did you see the buffet?					TROI			Yes, that's real Bajoran foraiga.					GEORDI			It wasn't easy to find.					RO			You shouldn't have gone to all			this trouble...	The others wave her comment off.3    ON PICARD	Ro sees him walking out of Ten Forward -- the one	person she might have wanted to spend time with.4    RESUME SCENE	Where the conversation is at a bit of a standstill.					TROI			Where are your new quarters?					RO			Deck eight, section four.	Again, Ro doesn't take the conversational opportunity --	she's just not good at these sorts of gatherings.					BEVERLY			What do you plan to --	Suddenly Picard's COM VOICE interrupts.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Picard to Lieutenant Ro.   STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - TEASER   3.4    CONTINUED:					RO				(hits combadge)			Go ahead, sir.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Please report to the Bridge.					RO			Yes, sir.				(to the others)			Excuse me.	We follow Ro as she crosses to the door, and EXITS to --5    INT. CORRIDOR	where she's surprised to find Picard standing there	waiting for her with a faint smile on his face.					RO			Captain...					PICARD			You seemed a bit overwhelmed by			all the attention... I thought you			could use a break.	She smiles when he realizes that he pulled her away as	a favor.					RO			To tell you the truth, I could...			I want to see everyone, but I			think I'd rather do it one at a			time.	Picard acknowledges that he understands. It's obvious	that they're both very happy to see each other.					PICARD			You're looking fit, Lieutenant.			Tactical Training must have agreed			with you.					RO			You know me -- I enjoy a			challenge.					PICARD			That school is more than a			challenge. Half the class washes			out every year.					(MORE)   STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - TEASER   4.5    CONTINUED:					PICARD (Cont'd)				(beat)			Somehow I knew you wouldn't be one			of those.					RO			I want you to know I appreciate			your recommending me.				(beat)			If it weren't for you, sir -- my			life would be a much different one			right now.	Picard smiles at her. He has an almost paternal	feeling about this young renegade.	Suddenly RIKER'S COM VOICE interrupts.					RIKER'S COM VOICE				(urgent)			Bridge to Captain --					PICARD				(hits combadge)			Go ahead.6    INT.

BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)					RO			We're coming into visual range.					PICARD			On screen.	On the VIEWSCREEN we see a Cardassian ship being	strafed by several smaller MAQUIS SHIPS -- Picard and	Riker react to their appearance.					RIKER			Those are Federation ships.					PICARD			Isolate one and magnify.	On the Viewscreen we see one of the Maquis ships closer	up -- it does not have Starfleet markings, or markings	of any kind. Picard recognizes it anyway.					PICARD				(continuing)			The Maquis...				(beat, grim)			Open a channel.	Worf works his console, indicates a channel is open.					PICARD			To all Maquis ships -- call off			your attack or we will be forced			to engage you.	After a moment --					WORF			No response.	Picard is not happy about this.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE  6A.10   CONTINUED:					PICARD			You are Federation citizens. Your			actions are in violation of our			treaty with the Cardassians. Call			off your attack.	Again, no response. Picard is left with no other	choice.					PICARD			Are we in firing range?					WORF			Not yet, sir.					PICARD			Arm phasers and photon torpedoes			and stand by.					RIKER			I never thought we'd be firing on			our own people to protect a			Cardassian ship...					DATA			The Maquis ships are regrouping...			they are closing in on the			Cardassian vessel.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE  7.10   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF				(off console)			The Cardassian's shields are down			to thirty percent.					RIKER			They may not be able to withstand			another hit.					WORF			Sir, we are within weapons range.					PICARD			Mister Worf, can you detonate a			torpedo spread between the Maquis			ships and the Cardassians?					WORF			Yes, sir.					PICARD			Do it.	Worf works his console and hears the SOUND of the	torpedoes firing --11   EXT.

CARDASSIANS are being treated by	N.D. Starfleet Personnel in the background, and Evek	keeps looking around to make sure they're all right,	making Beverly's task that much tougher.					GUL EVEK			Do your people have experience			treating Cardassians?					BEVERLY			Yes. Now please, sit still.	Evek lets out a frustrated breath. Picard ENTERS and	approaches. Beverly moves off to treat someone else.					PICARD			Gul Evek. I'm sorry we weren't			able to come to your aid sooner.	Gul Evek's response is far from grateful --					GUL EVEK			I suppose we're lucky you came at			all... lately Starfleet seems to			look the other way when the Maquis			attack.					PICARD			I assure you that's not the case.			We're doing everything we can to			control them.					GUL EVEK				(with cold irony)			The fact that they attacked my			ship suggests your efforts have			met with limited success.	He fixes Picard with a look.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE  9.15   CONTINUED:					GUL EVEK			The Maquis came at us with photon			torpedoes and type eight phasers --			tell me, Captain, how do you			suppose a group of civilians			acquired that kind of weaponry?					PICARD			It was certainly not through			official channels.					GUL EVEK			You don't think the fact that some			of the Maquis are former Starfleet			officers has anything to do with			it?	Picard's had just about enough of Gul Evek's	accusations.					PICARD			Starfleet does not condone the			Maquis' actions in the			Demilitarized Zone.				(beat)			Any more than your government			condones paramilitary actions by			Cardassian civilians.					GUL EVEK			We have taken measures to deal			with our colonists who have armed			themselves.	Picard throws Evek's words back at him --					PICARD			Considering that they destroyed a			Juhryan freighter less than a week			ago, I'd say your efforts have met			with limited success.	Evek leans in to Picard --					GUL EVEK			Give our military the right to			operate in the Zone for one week,			and we'll put a stop to			paramilitary activity once and for			all.					PICARD			What you're proposing would only			perpetuate the cycle of violence.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE  10.15   CONTINUED: (2)					GUL EVEK			Captain, if the Maquis aren't			stopped, this situation is going			to escalate to the point where the			Cardassian military will have no			choice but to take matters into			its own hands.	Off Picard's face as Gul Evek's threat sinks in...16   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	cruising near Admiral Nechayev's ship.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log, supplemental. Gul			Evek and his crew have left the			Enterprise, and we have proceeded			to our rendezvous with Admiral			Nechayev.17   INT. READY ROOM	as Picard and NECHAYEV ENTER. Nechayev looks around,	as though searching for something.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE  11.17   CONTINUED:					NECHAYEV			No Bularian canapes this time,			Captain?	Picard smiles.					PICARD			Twice seemed to be pushing it a			little...					NECHAYEV			It's just as well.				(conspiratorial)			They're extremely fattening.	Picard gestures her to a seat.					PICARD			You missed Gul Evek by a matter of			hours. I asked him to stay -- I			thought perhaps an admiral's			assurances would convince him that			we are trying to deal with the			Maquis situation.					NECHAYEV				(annoyed)			Evek manages to make the			Cardassians sound like helpless			sheep being preyed on by			Federation wolves. The truth is,			we caught the Cardassian			government supplying its colonies			in the Demilitarized Zone with			weapons.					PICARD				(for what it's worth)			Gul Evek assures me that practice			has stopped.					NECHAYEV			Ah. How comforting.	Nechayev seems a little more stressed than usual.	Picard stares closely at her.					PICARD			Admiral... this Maquis situation			has you worried...	Nechayev gives him a look. The general thawing between	them allows her to be more vulnerable with him.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE  12.17   CONTINUED: (2)					NECHAYEV			It's a mess... and it just keeps			getting worse. I never imagined			I'd have to worry about Federation			citizens doing violence to others.					PICARD			Frankly, I can understand why our			colonists have taken up arms --			Starfleet isn't there to protect			them anymore.					NECHAYEV			Believe me, Captain, if I were			living that close to the			Cardassians I'd keep a phaser			under my pillow, too.	This is a rare moment of candor from her -- another	sign of improvement in their relationship.					NECHAYEV				(continuing)			But in the last few weeks we've			seen signs that the Maquis are			moving beyond self-defense. Their			ranks are growing... they've			acquired ships, weapons... they			seem to be preparing for a more			aggressive military posture.	Nechayev takes a breath... shakes her head at the sorry	situation.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE  13.17   CONTINUED: (3)					NECHAYEV				(continuing)			We have to put a stop to them...			before the entire Demilitarized			Zone ignites.				(beat)			But before we can stop them -- we			have to find them. They seem to			be scattered in small cells around			the Zone. And we don't have			reliable intelligence about any of			them.					PICARD			Perhaps you need an undercover			operative.					NECHAYEV			Our thinking exactly. We intend			to infiltrate their organization.				(beat)			And the person we want to do it is			aboard your ship right now.	Off Picard's questioning look...									CUT TO:18   INT. RO'S QUARTERS	where Picard has just told her Nechayev's plan.					RO			Starfleet wants me to infiltrate			the Maquis?					PICARD			Because of your recent training...			because you're Bajoran... and			because of your past troubles with			Starfleet -- you'll have a certain			credibility.	Ironically, Picard interrupted Ro while she was	unpacking her belongings. These are the smaller,	windowless quarters.					RO			Well, that's certainly true.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE  14.18   CONTINUED:	She continues unpacking, perturbed, not thrilled by	this idea. Picard watches her carefully, understanding	her conflicting emotions.					RO				(continuing)			And just when would this mission			begin?					PICARD			Immediately.	Ro shoots him a glance.					RO			I see.	She pulls things out of her bag, smoothing and	refolding, using the activity to quiet her mind.					RO				(continuing)			I've spent the better part of my			life fighting the Cardassians...			I never thought I'd be helping			them out.					PICARD			This is a rare case where our			interests coincide with theirs --			we both want peace in the			Demilitarized Zone.	Ro stares down at the articles of clothing in her hand.	Solemnly --					RO			I've heard a lot about the Maquis.				(beat)			One of my instructors in Tactical			Training... a Lieutenant Commander			in Starfleet -- a man I admired			and respectded... was sympathetic			to them. He resigned and left to			join them.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE  15.18   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant.			Our civilian population in the			Demilitarized Zone is in a			difficult situation.				(beat)			But sympathy ends at a certain			point. The peace treaty isn't			just a piece of paper. If the			Maquis force us into a war with			Cardassia, it could mean hundreds			of thousands of lives.	Ro nods an acknowledgement; she understands what's at	stake.					PICARD			Laren, two years ago, Starfleet			would never have tapped you for			this mission. They must have a			lot of confidence in you now.	She turns to him, the man who's done so much for her,	always believed in her.					RO			The way I see it... there's at			least one good reason to take this			mission, sir.				(beat)			That's to validate your faith in			me.	Picard and she share a smile as they think of	everything they've been through together...

ALIEN BAR (OPTICAL)	A seedy joint on some planet in the Demilitarized Zone.	Its patrons are a motley mix -- humans, Bajorans, and	a few Aliens.	The door OPENS and Ro ENTERS -- she's dressed in wornlooking	civilian clothes. She casts a nervous look	around, then moves toward the back of the bar -- we	immediately get the feeling she's in trouble, trying to	hide from someone.	Several patrons take note of Ro's entrance -- including	a HUMAN MALE at the bar, SANTOS. This is the kind of	place where no one asks questions, so Ro is left alone.	She sits on a bench against the back wall of the bar,	near a HUMANOID who casts a baleful glance at her and	then returns to his drink. Nearby, a male alien is	being entertained by an alien prostitute -- they're	kissing and laughing quietly to themselves.	Suddenly the door bursts OPEN and Worf and Data ENTER	with an urgent step -- they're looking for someone.	Ro immediately slides over to the HUMANOID and sits on	his lap, her back to Worf and Data -- his eyes go wide	but before he can say anything she starts kissing him,	pretending to be a prostitute. He doesn't resist.	All eyes are on Worf and Data, who quickly reconnoiter	the area -- nothing here, just some alien schlubs and	a couple of hookers in the back corner.					WORF			We are looking for a Bajoran			woman, dark hair.	They are met with blank stares -- no one wants to get	involved.					DATA			She is responsible for the death			of a Cardassian soldier.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO  17.20   CONTINUED:	Again, no one volunteers anything. The human at the	bar, Santos, glances back at Ro -- he's definitely	putting it together. Worf glares at the bartender.					WORF			If we learn that she has been			here, this establishment will be			closed down.	Santos steps forward.					SANTOS			You say she had dark hair?					WORF			Yes.	There's beat in which we think he's going to give her	up.					SANTOS			She was here... you just missed			her.					DATA			Do you know where she went?					SANTOS			No.	Worf and Data exchange a glance, and then move toward	the door. Worf casts a last scowl at the patrons, then	they EXIT. Ro immediately extricates herself from the	humanoid --					RO			Nice meeting you --	He's disappointed to lose her, but Ro is already up and	away before he can protest. She turns to Santos.					RO				(continuing)			Thanks.	With that, she crosses to the bar and orders.

She knows he took	a risk lying for her, but she can't be sure why he did	it.					RO			Starfleet thinks I did. That's			reason enough to hide.				(beat)			Why did you tell them I'd left?	Now it's his turn to study her face. The bartender	slides a drink in front of Ro.					SANTOS			There are worse things a person			could do than kill a Cardassian			soldier.	They hold each other's gaze for a long moment.					RO			You don't often meet someone			willing to say that out loud.					SANTOS			In the Zone, there are a lot of us			who feel that way.	She raises her glass slightly.					RO			I'd like to meet people like that.	Santos studies her face for a long beat. Ro takes a	sip of her drink, when she turns to look at him again	she sees that he's carrying a small PHASER. She	reacts, but it's too late -- he FIRES, stunning her and	causing her to crumple in her seat. Off this moment...21   INT. MEETING ROOM	where Ro is unconscious, laid out on a bench.	Santos is with two others, a woman named KALITA, and an	older human male named MACIAS. Macias has a scar on	his face; his eyes shine with intelligence and	kindness. Kalita has a phaser.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO  19.21   CONTINUED:	All three of them are Maquis. Ro has been brought to	a town in the DMZ where many of the settlers are Maquis	or sympathizers. The room has a rough-hewn quality;	this settlement is on the "frontier."	Ro's eyes flutter open.					MACIAS			Don't be afraid. You're not in			danger here.	Ro sits up, touches her head to steady herself.					SANTOS			What's your name?	Ro doesn't answer, partly because she doesn't know who	these people are, partly because she's a little groggy.					KALITA			Did you kill that Cardassian			soldier?					RO			Who are you?					SANTOS			The people who saved you from			Starfleet.	Ro looks around at them. She suspects these people are	Maquis, but she must move cautiously.					RO			Thanks.				(beat)			But I'll be leaving now.					KALITA			Do you even know what planet			you're on?					RO			Ronara Prime.					SANTOS			Not anymore.	Ro reacts --  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO  20.21   CONTINUED: (2)					RO			Where am I then?					KALITA			We're not going to tell you that			until we know more about you.	Kalita's tone is colder than the others; she's more	suspicious of Ro.					RO			Like what?					SANTOS			Did you kill that Cardassian?					RO			Yes.					KALITA			That's a risky thing to do in the			Demilitarized Zone. You can end			up being hunted by Starfleet and			the Cardassians.					RO				(re: Santos)			Then... why did he risk bringing			me here?	Kalita makes one thing clear.					KALITA			We're asking the questions. Who			are you?					RO			My name is Ro Laren. I grew up in			the Bajoran camps...	Macias smiles his quiet smile.					MACIAS			That would explain why you have no			love for Cardassians.					RO			I know what they're capable of.			They tortured my father to			death... and forced me to watch.	Macias shakes his head in sympathy, but Santos and	Kalita press on.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO  21.21   CONTINUED: (3)					SANTOS			Where do you live now?					RO			Nowhere...				(beat)			I was a Starfleet officer.

I'm			not exactly what you'd call			Starfleet material.					SANTOS			When were you on Jaros?	Ro acts like she's losing patience.					RO			What difference does it make?	Kalita snaps her back hard.					KALITA			We want to check your story. When			were you there?					RO			Starfleet let me out about three			years ago because I agreed to do			some work for them... mostly			having to do with Bajor. But I			got tired of watching them placate			the Cardassians and left.					KALITA			You resigned?					RO			Not officially.				(wry)			That's part of the reason they're			looking for me.					SANTOS			What were you doing on Ronara?  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO  22.21   CONTINUED: (4)					RO			Look, I've answered enough of your			questions -- I'd like to know who			you people are.	Macias decides to give her an answer.					MACIAS			Let's just say... we sympathize			with those who oppose Cardassia.	Ro stares at the group for a long moment. Then --					RO			Are you Maquis?	A small silence. No one gives away a thing.					MACIAS			What if we were... ?	Ro faces him squarely.					RO			If you were... then I would ask if			I could join you and help you			fight.	Macias glances over at Santos with a questioning look,	and Santos nods a yes. Macias turns back to Ro.					MACIAS			We will check your story.	Kalita hesitates, but Macias fixes a firm gaze on her.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO  23.21   CONTINUED: (5)					MACIAS			Go ahead.

MAQUIS SETTLEMENT - NIGHT	as Ro and Macias walk through the central square.	Again, this is a "frontier town" -- it has a rough-hewn	quality, although there is evidence of Federation	technology.	Various N.D. SETTLERS go about their business as Ro	and Macias walk and talk.					RO			Aren't you taking a chance by			letting me see all this? What if			my story doesn't check out -- what			if I'm not who I say I am?					MACIAS			Then we'll have a problem, won't			we?	It is a definite threat, but Macias' manner makes the	statement less ominous.					RO			You are Maquis, aren't you?					MACIAS			Many people here are.					RO			Starfleet considers you outlaws.			They're afraid you'll destroy the			peace treaty.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO  24.22   CONTINUED:					MACIAS			They don't understand the			situation here in the Zone.	Ro hears the anger in his voice.					MACIAS				(continuing)			I lived on Juhraya... the colony			suddenly found itself in			Cardassian territory when the			treaty was signed. Some of us			chose to stay and take our			chances.				(beat)			One night I was dragged from my			bed and beaten.

And no one seems to see			that except the Maquis.	There is a silence as they walk. Then--					MACIAS				(continuing)			How old were you when your father			was killed?	Ro goes into a shutdown mode. This is something she	still doesn't talk about easily.					RO			I'd rather not talk about it.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO  25.22   CONTINUED: (2)	Macias gives her a look, recognizes the denial, backs	off.

A trader coming from			Pendi Two said he could verify			that the Cardassians are going to			start supplying their colonists			with bio-genic weapons.	This gets Macias' attention.					RO			I thought every shipment coming			into the Zone was searched...					KALITA				(scoffing at her				 naivete)			The Cardassians always seem to			find a way to get around problems			like that.  STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO  30.26   CONTINUED:					SANTOS			We have to make a preemptive			strike. Send a message to			Cardassia that we won't sit still			and let them kill us with toxins.					MACIAS			Agreed. But we can't mount a			strike without medical supplies --			and our stockpile is dangerously			low.					KALITA				(concerned)			If we put in a request for more,			it'll draw suspicion.	A moment as they ponder this grim situation. Ro	hesitates, then --					RO			I can get medical supplies.	They all turn to stare at her.					RO				(continuing)			I served on the Enterprise. They			keep extra med-kits on hand for			relief missions.	Santos almost finds this amusing.					SANTOS			You're wanted by Starfleet.			They're not going to give you medkits			just because you ask.					RO			I have no intention of asking.

It's a difficult			instrument... but I enjoy the			challenge.	There is a small pause.					RO			My father... played the klavion.	Macias glances sidelong at her. This is the first	spontaneous offering Ro has made about her father. He	is silent. There is another pause, and then Ro	continues.      STAR TREK: "Preemptive Strike" - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT FOUR      49.47   CONTINUED: (2)					RO			When I was very young... and			afraid of monsters under my bed...			my father would play for me.

They pull	weapons from their robes and start FIRING.	People are scattering and trying to take cover. The	Cardassians had the advantage of surprise, and have	taken up strategic positions that provide them shelter	and allow them to dominate the fight.	Some of the Maquis are shooting back, but most weren't	armed when the attack broke out.
