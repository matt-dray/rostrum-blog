RISIAN PLEASURE HAVEN - THE LOBBY	Imagine a twenty-fourth century Hawaiian resort. The	indoor/outdoor open-sided lobby (one end leads off to	a sun drenched lanai) has a simple grace and beauty	that is immediately apparent.	In the center of the lobby is a stone shrine. Residing	on the alter is a large rotund idol (also made of	stone) called a Horga'hn. Smaller, wooden Horga'hns	circle the main figure.	As for the guests, they all appear rested and happy.	Clothing is loose, casual and extremely revealing.	Couples predominate, with the spectrum of sexual	preferences being evident.2    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Two sleek and well dressed aliens (Vorgons -- one male,	BORATUS, the other female, AJUR) MATERIALIZE by one	of the entranceways.	The Vorgons glance curiously around the lobby then make	their way over to a nearby wall grid.	Ajur places her palm on an adjoining sensor panel which	glows at her touch.					COMPUTER (V.O.)			Welcome to Risa. All that is ours			is yours.					AJUR			We are looking for the lodging			chamber of Captain Jean-Luc			Picard.	A beat as the computer accesses the data.   STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/29/90 - TEASER   2.2    CONTINUED:					COMPUTER (V.O.)			A file scan reveals no record of			a Captain Picard currently			visiting Risa.	The Vorgons exchange a look of concern.					AJUR			When is he expected to arrive?					COMPUTER (V.O.)			Where is no arrival date on file			for any such individual.	Ajur removes her hand from the panel. It goes dark.					BORATUS			Could we have been mistaken?	And when Ajur speaks, it is without the slightest hint	of doubt.					AJUR			He will come.	HOLD ON the Vorgons. They look confident and slightly	ominous.3    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Slowly circling a cloud shrouded planet.					RIKER (V.O.)			First officer's log, Stardate			43745.2. We are in orbit of			Gemaris Five where, for the past			two weeks, Captain Picard has been			serving as mediator in a trade			dispute between the Gemarians and			their nearest neighbor, the			Dachlyds.4    INT. BRIDGE	DATA at Ops, ENSIGN BENNETT at Conn, WORF at Tactical.	RIKER standing by Command.   STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/24/90 - TEASER   3.4    CONTINUED:	He greets TROI who has just entered from the aft	turbolift.					RIKER			Welcome back, Counselor.					TROI			It's good to be back. It's been			a grueling two weeks.					RIKER			I take it the captain was able			to negotiate an agreement mutually			beneficial to both parties.					TROI			He did. Though I don't know how			he managed it. Both the Gemarians			and the Dachlyds are incredibly			stubborn people.					RIKER			The more difficult the task, the			sweeter the victory.	The turbolift doors re-open and out steps PICARD.	Though he moves with his usual determination, there is	a slight edge of weariness to his gestures. He	definitely does not act like a man who has just won a	"sweet" victory.					PICARD			Break us out of orbit, Mister			Bennett. Set a course for			Starbase twelve.	Picard approaches the Command area.					PICARD				(continuing)			Report, Number One.   STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/24/90 - TEASER   4.4    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			Everything status quo, sir.					PICARD			Very well...	He glances around the bridge. Then abruptly:					PICARD				(continuing)			If anyone needs me, I'll be in			my Ready Room.					RIKER			Sir...	Picard turns back in the doorway.					RIKER				(continuing)			Congratulations.					PICARD			About what?					PIKER			About the trade agreement.	A beat, then Picard gives a brief nod of	acknowledgement before disappearing into his office.	A puzzled Riker stares after him.					RIKER				(continuing)			Counselor, is it my imagination			or is something bothering the			captain?					TROI			He has been under a great deal			of strain lately. While on			Gemaris he ate sparingly... and			slept even less.					RIKER			Is there anything we can do?					TROI			I have a solution in mind, but			I doubt he'll agree to it.   STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/24/90 - TEASER   5.4    CONTINUED: (3)					RIKER			And what would that be?					TROI				(simply)			Our captain needs a vacation.	An amused Riker smiles sympathetically. Troi is	absolutely right. The captain will never agree to it.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                             STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE   6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:5    INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)	Picard at his desk studying a stack of reports. He	leans forward to stretch out a stiff back.	The DOOR CHIME SOUNDS. Picard is too distracted to	respond. The CHIME SOUNDS again.					PICARD			Come.	BEVERLY ENTERS. A woman with a mission.					BEVERLY			Sir, it's come to my attention			one of the crew has been			neglecting his health again.	A warning light goes off in Picard's head. He sits up	a little straighter in his chair.					PICARD			How so?					BEVERLY			He suffers from a classic case			of stress related ailments brought			about by overwork. Exhaustion,			irritability... muscle spasms.			Yet he insists on ignoring them.	Picard, who was just about to rub his aching back,	halts in mid-gesture. He's now certain he's the object	of Beverly's report.					PICARD			It doesn't sound all that serious.					BEVERLY			And I plan to keep it that way.					PICARD			Recommended treatment.					BEVERLY			A week's shore leave.	Picard shakes his head, dismissing the notion entirely.   STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE   7.5    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Impossible.	But Beverly comes right back at him.					BEVERLY			Jean-Luc... I could make it an			order.					PICARD			But you won't... Beverly you know			I loathe vacations.					BEVERLY			You loathe going on vacation.			Once you're there you have a			marvelous time. You told me you			loved the four days you spent on			Zytchin Three.					PICARD			I lied.				(an idea)			The Enterprise is scheduled to			spend a week undergoing a			maintenance overhaul at Starbase			twelve. While there, I promise			to make full use of all available			recreation activities.					BEVERLY			Watching some technician fill			deuterium tanks is not my idea			of fun.	It doesn't sound like much fun to Picard either.					PICARD			I suppose I could find a few hours			to spend on the Holodeck.					BEVERLY			Forget about the Holodeck. There			must be someplace you'd like to			go.					PICARD			The Astrophysics Center on Icor			Nine is holding a symposium on rogue			star clusters. I had given serious			thought to attending.  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE  7A.5    CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY			Serious thought is the last thing			you need. Why not go some place			beautiful? Where you can relax			and be pampered. You deserve it.   STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE   8.5    CONTINUED: (3)	But Picard isn't ready to commit.					PICARD			I'll give it serious thought.					BEVERLY				(insistent)			Captain...					PICARD			Beverly... enough.	Beverly sighs and backs off. Picard returns to his	reports, confident that he's dodged that particular	bullet.5A   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship cruising at warp speed.5B   INT. CORRIDOR	Picard and Riker are headed towards a turbolift.					RIKER			So have you decided where you're			going yet?	The turbolift doors open. Picard and Riker ENTER.6    INT. TURBOLIFT	Continuous.					PICARD			Yes Number One, I have.				(to computer)			The bridge.					RIKER			I meant for your shore leave.	Picard glares at his first officer.  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE  8A.6    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Not you too.					RIKER				(to computer)			Halt.	The turbolift stops. A smiling Riker launches into	his sales pitch.   STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE   9.6    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER				(continuing)			I know this perfect little			vacation spot... In fact, its			co-ordinates lie within this			sector.					PICARD			How convenient. Except I have			absolutely no intention of taking			a holiday. Do I make myself			clear?					RIKER			Very clear...					PICARD			Good. I'm glad we've got that			straightened out.				(to computer)			Resume.	The turbolift continues on its way. Riker, realizing	he doesn't have much time left, presses on.					RIKER			It's called Risa. And believe			me Captain, it's paradise. Warm			tropical breezes... exotic food...			and nothing to do but sit back			and enjoy the quiet.				(a beat)			And then there's --	Picard anticipates Riker's next thought.					PICARD & RIKER				(together)			... the women...					PICARD			... of course.					RIKER			I'm sure you'd find their			sybaritic outlook on life very			appealing.  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE  10.6    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			I'm sure I would.	Riker thinks he has the captain sold. The turbolift	doors open.					RIKER			I'm glad to hear you say so, sir.7thru	OMITTED99A   INT. BRIDGE	As Picard and Riker EXIT the aft turbolift.					PICARD			Unfortunately, this vessel is			about to undergo extensive			repairs requiring my personal			supervision.					RIKER			But what about Risa?					PICARD			Some other time, Number One.	Troi is on her way over to the turbolift. Perhaps a	brief conspiratorial look passes between her and Riker	before she speaks.					TROI			Will, I've just received some			delightful news.					RIKER			Really?	And we get the feeling that what follows is said more	for Picard's benefit than for Riker's.					TROI			There's an excellent chance my			mother may be meeting us at			Starbase twelve.	To Picard this sounds anything but "delightful."					PICARD			Your mother?  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT ONE  11.9A   CONTINUED:					TROI			Yes, she's returning home from			a conference on Achrady Seven.			She's going to try to rearrange			her schedule so she can spend some			time visiting with us.					RIKER			That's wonderful, Deanna.					TROI			She mentioned how much she's			looking forward to seeing you			again, Captain.					PICARD			Did she?	Troi ENTERS the turbolift.	The turbolift doors close. Picard is only too well	aware of how "fond" Lwaxana can be.					PICARD			Commander, I'd like a word with			you. In private.	Picard ENTERS the Ready Room. Riker follows.9B   INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)	Continuous.					RIKER			Is something wrong, Captain?					PICARD			Tell me, Number One, is the entire			crew aware of this little scheme			to send me off on holiday?  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE  12.9B   CONTINUED:					RIKER				(fighting back a smile)			I believe there are two ensigns			stationed on deck thirty-nine who			know nothing about it.					PICARD			I suppose this means I can look			forward to a week of continual			harassment on the subject.	Riker's look says he wouldn't be at all surprised. A	beat as Picard decides it's not really worth the fight.					PICARD			I admit I have been feeling a bit			fatigued.	Hold on Picard having made his decision.   STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE13-13A.      9BA	EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	coming out of warp and approaching Risa.9C   INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS	The ship is out of warp. Picard, dressed in casual	clothing, is packing up some books to take with him on	his trip. Riker and Troi are there to see him off.					RIKER			I'll see to it that these bags are			beamed directly to your room.  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT ONE  14.9C   CONTINUED:	Troi leans over and unbuttons the top button of the	Captain's shirt. That feels better.					TROI			You look very handsome, Captain...			If you don't mind my saying so.	Riker looks over at the stack of books lying atop a	travel bag.					RIKER			You're not really bringing all			these books with you?  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE  15.9C   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			I thought I'd take along some			light reading... in case I got			bored.	Riker checks out some of the titles.					RIKER			Ulysses by James Joyce? Ethics,			Sophistry and the Alternate			Universe by Ving Kuda -- You call			this light reading?					PICARD			To each his own, Number One.	Picard closes up the bag. As he starts out of the	room:					RIKER			Did I ever mention how imaginative			Risian women are?					TROI			Too often, Commander.	Riker looks over at Troi. Could there have been a	slight trace of jealousy in the counselor's remark?9D   INT. CORRIDOR LEADING TO TRANSPORTER ROOM	Picard, Troi and Riker.					RIKER			Captain, I do have one request.					PICARD			You want me to bring you back a			souvenir?	How did he know?					RIKER			It's called a Horga'hn. You won't			have any trouble finding one.					PICARD			Consider it done.  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE  15A.9E   NEW ANGLE	WORF and a security guard are waiting outside the	Transporter Room.					WORF			Sir, I would feel better if you			would allow me to assign a			security officer to accompany you.			We will be out of communication			range as soon as we leave orbit.					PICARD			I don't think that will be			necessary, Lieutenant. Risa has			a reputation of being a most			peaceful planet.					WORF			Aye, sir.  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE  16.9E   CONTINUED:	Picard realizes there's no use in putting it off any	longer.					PICARD			The ship is yours, Number One.					TROI			Enjoy your trip, Captain.					PICARD			I'll try, Counselor.	Picard ENTERS the Transporter Room. As the doors	close, Riker turns to Troi.					RIKER			He's going to have a great time.10   OMITTED11   INT. RISIAN PLEASURE HAVEN - THE LOBBY (OPTICAL)	Picard MATERIALIZES. A glance at the blissful faces of	the other guests only serves to convince him that it's	going to be a long week.12   NEW ANGLE	A woman, VASH, mid-thirties, striking good looks, moves	away from the pond, where she has stood admiring the	shrine of the Horga'hn. She casts a backward glance	at the idols.  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE  17.12   CONTINUED:	She and Picard are on a collision course, and sure	enough, they come together with a jolt.					PICARD			Pardon me.	Vash is about to answer back when something catches her	eye in the entranceway behind Picard. What happens	next is quite fast.13   VASH'S P.O.V.	SOVAK, a Ferengi has just arrived at the Haven. His	eyes search the room.14   BACK TO SCENE	Vash moves slightly to the side so that Picard's body	will block her from Sovak's sightline. Her eyes light	up as she suddenly "recognizes" Picard.					VASH			It's so good to see you again.	Before Picard can react, she throws her arms around his	neck and gives him an enthusiastic kiss.	Her eyes remain open and she sees that Sovak has	spotted her anyway. At first the Ferengi looks as if	he's going to approach her, but he thinks better of	it and with an ugly grin, moves away.	A relieved Vash then gazes over at Picard whose eyes	have stayed open as well. For a beat, they stare at	one another, lips pressed together. Then Picard breaks	the embrace.					PICARD			I think you've mistaken me for			someone else.	Vash studies Picard's face closely and then reacts.					VASH			You know, I believe you're right.	She shrugs, and then flashes a very provocative smile.  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE  18.14   CONTINUED:					VASH				(continuing)			Welcome to Risa.	She strolls away.					PICARD				(to himself)			A simple handshake would have			sufficed.	He walks off.

LANAI (OPTICAL)	Another perfect day at the Pleasure Haven. The	temperature is the equivalent of a balmy eighty-three	degrees Fahrenheit; a warm breeze prevents the heat	from becoming oppressive, and the water (you'll have to	take my word for it because we never get to see the	ocean) is as clear and calm as a lake.	The CAMERA OPENS on a happy couple, lying asleep on the	veranda. CAMERA PANS over to a second couple, kissing	passionately. CAMERA PANS again to REVEAL:17   PICARD	Sitting in a lounge chair, trying to concentrate on the	thick tome he's reading. It's not as simple as it	would appear. First of all, it's not easy to relax	with a couple locked in the throes of lust only a few	feet away. For a private man like Jean-Luc Picard,	such public behavior is distasteful at best. Then	another couple comes running up from the unseen beach.	The water from their still dripping bodies sprays over	him. Annoyed, he carefully wipes dry his book.18   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As he settles back down, a hoverball glides over to	him and stops dead in the air only inches from his	face. Picard tries to ignore it but the sphere emits	an aggravating low level HUM. He casually tries to	swat it away but it avoids his hand and darts away.	Picard reopens his book... just as the hoverball makes	an abrupt reappearance above his head. As he looks	up:					JOVAL (V.O.)			Return.	The hoverball zips away.  STAR TREK: "Captain's Holiday" - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT TWO  20.19   NEW ANGLE	to include Joval, a delicate beauty wearing an eye	catching bathing outfit. She grabs hold of the	hoverball.					JOVAL			My apologies. I fear I have yet			to master the art of hoverball.					PICARD			So it would seem.	Joval sits beside him.					JOVAL			My name is Joval. I am employed			here. Is there anything you			require to make your stay a more			pleasant one?	A small smile from Picard.

There is no way to	verify the Vorgon's story -- and his instincts are	whispering caution.
