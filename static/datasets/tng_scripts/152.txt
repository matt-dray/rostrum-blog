Right			-- a "duck blind."					PICARD				(nods)			The anthropologists are studying			an extended family of Mintakans			at close range... from a			camouflaged observation post.					TROI			According to Doctor Barron's			preliminary reports, the Mintakans			are proto-Vulcan humanoids at the			Bronze Age level. Quite peaceful			and highly rational.					PICARD				(nods)			Not surprising, considering how			closely their evolution has			paralleled Vulcan.					WORF			Captain, incoming transmission			from Mintaka Three.					PICARD			On screen.	On the MAIN VIEWER appears the fuzzy image of BARRON,	intermittently broken up by LINES AND SWIRLS of STATIC	INTERFERENCE. Barron is a middle-aged human; he's in	a small cave-like room -- the "DUCK BLIND" -- which	is both scientific laboratory and living quarters for	the three members of the field team. One wall contains	ports looking out onto the planet.	Behind Barron, two more scientists -- PALMER (a young	human male) and WARREN (an older human female) --	work on the malfunctioning reactor. Barron's mood	is calm, unhurried -- the situation is not desperate.					BARRON			Barron to Enterprise. Our			temporary repairs have failed.			The reactor is now inoperative.     STAR TREK: "Who Watches...

A console	a few feet from the reactor SHORTS OUT. STATIC and	INTERFERENCE obscure the image.	Barron and Warren are STRUCK by the BOLTS and knocked	unconscious. Palmer, also ZAPPED, covers his eyes,	temporarily blinded, and gropes randomly.3    EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)	A hillside with sheer rock walls and outcroppings.	About three meters up a nearly sheer rockface is a	narrow path. A large section of the rockface above the	path SHIMMERS and FADES AWAY -- revealing the exterior	ported wall of the "duck blind" (the interior of which	is built inside the rockface). BLUE SPARKS dance	about the metal structure of the duck blind.3A   INT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)	Palmer stumbles to a port, falls through it to the	outside --3B   EXT.

DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)	Riker, Data, Geordi, BEVERLY, and A MEDIC MATERIALIZE	inside the duck blind. SPARKS and CORONA EFFECTS are	coursing through all metal parts of the structure.	Riker and Geordi start working on the damaged reactor	while Data begins repairs on the shorted-out console.	Beverly and the medic tend to the injured Barron and	Warren.8    EXT. MINTAKA THREE - PATH - DAY	Two Mintakans -- middle-aged LIKO and his teenaged	daughter OJI -- are walking. Mintakans look very	similar to Vulcans -- they have the same pointed ears	and arched eyebrows. Note: Though Mintakans are a	cool-headed, rational people, they are not as stoic and	emotionless as Vulcans.					LIKO			Why did we have to come so early?					OJI			When the sun reaches its zenith,			I have to be ready to take the			measurements.					LIKO				(amused)			You'll be ready. You've read			the sundial hundreds of times.     STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/14/89 - ACT ONE     6.8    CONTINUED:					OJI			Yes, father -- but never as the			appointed recordkeeper.					LIKO				(smiles)			You're taking your duties quite			seriously. Your mother would have			been proud of you.8A   EXT. MINTAKA THREE - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY	Liko and Oji ENTER the area, which is presently	unoccupied. Outside the "assembly hall" is a large	bronze sundial/astrolabe. Oji steps up to the	astrolabe, takes a preliminary sighting. In doing so,	she notices something o.s.:9    REVERSE ANGLE (OPTICAL)	On a distant hillside, the exterior of the duck blind	is visible. Oji points it out to Liko:					OJI			What is that?					LIKO			I don't know...	Curious, they quickly head off toward the hillside.10   INT.

MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)	Liko and Oji ENTER the area around the duck blind and	stop in amazement. Liko gestures for Oji to stay	hidden as he cautiously approaches the path leading to	the duck blind.10B  WIDER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	The medic working on Warren nods to Beverly -- ready.	Beverly taps her communicator:					BEVERLY			Enterprise -- beam Martinez and			his patient directly to Sickbay.	Warren and the medic attending her DEMATERIALIZE. Data	looks up:					DATA			Doctor --	Beverly also looks up --11   ANGLE ON THE PORT (OPTICAL)	Peeking in one of the ports is Liko -- stunned at the	sight of these strangers magically disappearing.	Curious, Liko pokes his head further into the port, and	places a hand on the metal frame.     STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/11/89 - ACT ONE     7.11   CONTINUED:	A furious ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE ZAPS Liko; dazed and	disoriented, he stumbles back.12   EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)	Liko has fallen away from the duck blind. He slips	off the narrow path, falls three meters, and lands hard	on a section of jagged rock, severely gashing his head.	He GROANS.13   ANGLE ON OJI	Oji is at the bottom of the path. She's about to come	to her father's aid, but holds back as she sees:14   ON BEVERLY (OPTICAL)	Beverly has already emerged from the duck blind and is	heading down the path to Liko's side.15   ANGLE ON LIKO (OPTICAL)	in intense pain. Beverly approaches, administers a	hypo. A moment later, Liko is out cold. Beverly	examines him, then touches her communicator:					BEVERLY			Crusher to Enterprise. Medical			emergency. Two to beam directly			to Sickbay.	Beverly and Liko DEMATERIALIZE.15A  ANGLE ON OJI	emerging from her hiding place and moving toward the	spot where her father disappeared.16   INT. DUCK BLIND - DAY	Riker and Geordi at the reactor. Geordi finishes up:					GEORDI			That should do it.     STAR TREK: "Who Watches...

MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)	As the camouflage unit kicks in, the duck blind	DISAPPEARS; the rockface is now, to all appearances,	solid rock.18   ANGLE ON OJI	gazing bewildered at the wall of rock. She's	overwhelmed by the inexplicable wonders she has	witnessed.									CUT TO:19   INT. SICKBAY	Busy. MEDICAL PERSONNEL are performing surgery on Liko	and applying various forms of burn and anti-radiation	treatment to Warren and Barron.	Beverly moves from one station to another, giving	orders. She crosses to Liko's biobed. The medic	is finishing up with Liko.20   NEW ANGLE	as Picard ENTERS, crosses to Liko's biobed, and reacts	to the sight of a Mintakan aboard the Enterprise.	Picard glowers at Beverly, but before he can speak:     STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE     9.20   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Before you start quoting the Prime			Directive -- he'd already seen			us; the damage was done. It was			bring him aboard or let him die.					PICARD			Then why didn't you let him die?					BEVERLY			Because we were responsible for			his injuries!					PICARD			I don't know if I concur with			that reasoning, Doctor. But now			that he's here, you must remove			all memory of his encounter with			the away team.					BEVERLY			By erasing short-term recall?					PICARD			It's been accomplished before.					BEVERLY			Yes, I'm familiar with Doctor			Pulaski's technique.				(studies Liko)			Though I can't guarantee it will			be effective on Mintakan brain			chemistry --	Beverly is interrupted by a COMMOTION O.S. --21   ANGLE ON BARRON	Barron has regained consciousness, but he's half-delirious	and agitated. He struggles wildly with a	medic who's trying to restrain him:					BARRON			No! We must evacuate --	Picard, Beverly, and other medics run to Barron's	biobed and hold him back. Beverly zaps Barron with	a hypospray; Barron's struggles weaken.    STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE    9A.21   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY				(forceful)			Doctor Barron! You're on the			Enterprise. You're safe now.	Barron gazes at her; reason slowly returns.    STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE    10.22   ANGLE ON LIKO	CLOSE on Liko's face -- after a beat, Liko's eyes open.					BARRON (O.S.)			The others?					PICARD (O.S.)			Doctor Warren is here. We're			doing all we can.	Liko, not daring to move a muscle, looks to the source	of the voices:23   ANGLE - WHAT LIKO SEES	Medical personnel, Beverly, and Picard are gathered	around Barron's biobed. Picard is the only one in a	red uniform; he stands out dramatically.					BARRON			And Palmer? Where is Palmer?					PICARD			Still on Mintaka Three.					BARRON			Picard -- you have to find him.					PICARD			We will.					BARRON			He may be hurt --					PICARD			Rest assured -- we will not leave			until we locate Palmer.	Picard's strength and conviction mollify Barron.    STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE    11.23   CONTINUED:					BARRON			Thank you, Picard.	Beverly helps Barron lie back and relax. Picard moves	away from the biobed, taps his communicator:					PICARD			Picard to bridge. Report.					WORF'S COM VOICE			Scans of the planet detect no			humans, Captain.					PICARD			Very well. Take us into a close			orbit.					WORF'S COM VOICE			Sir, a close orbit will			increase sensor efficiency by			only four percent.					PICARD			I want that four percent,			Lieutenant.					WORF'S COM VOICE			Aye, sir.					PICARD			Picard out.24   NEW ANGLE	as Picard turns, finds himself looking at Liko -- who's	looking right back at him. Picard's speechless. After	a beat:					LIKO				(tentative)			Picard?	Liko's voice catches everyone's attention. Beverly	moves instantly to Liko's side, knocks Liko out with a	hypospray.    STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE    12.24   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Damn --					PICARD			Doctor, your next task is clear.	Beverly nods as she looks at her troublesome patient:									CUT TO:25   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around Mintaka Three.26   EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY	Oji is atop a bluff, finishing her reconnaissance. No	luck. She returns to the duck blind rockface, touches	it once more. Nothing happens. The hologram	generator's doing its job; the rockface looks and feels	authentic.27   EXT. MINTAKA THREE - SECLUDED AREA - DAY (OPTICAL)	In a location not visible from the duck blind area, the	sleeping body of Liko MATERIALIZES. Slowly, Liko	awakens.28   EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY	as Oji starts to walk back down the path.					LIKO (O.S.)				(weak)			Oji?     STAR TREK: "Who Watches...

MINTAKA THREE - SECLUDED AREA - DAY	as Liko sits up, examines himself.					LIKO			Here...	After a beat, Oji ENTERS, rushes to her father's side	-- and is amazed to see that her father's wounds have	disappeared.					OJI			I thought I'd never see you again.			When you and the woman vanished,			I was sure you were dead.					LIKO			I think I was... but I was brought			back to life. I awoke in an			incredible place -- and my wounds			were gone. I had been healed.					OJI			How is that possible?	Liko ponders this gravely.					LIKO			Long ago, our people believed in			beings with great powers. These			beings made the rains come, told			the sun when to rise, and caused			all life to be born, to grow,			to die.					OJI			But those are just tales -- old			superstitions.    STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/14/89 - ACT ONE    14.29   CONTINUED:					LIKO			Perhaps the beliefs of our			ancestors are true.

Beverly is	in mid-report.					BEVERLY			... Barron is stable, but Warren			is still critical.					RIKER			Palmer is missing, and scans of			the planet pick up Mintakan life			forms only -- no humans.			However...	Riker looks to Data.					DATA			The area around the duck blind			exhibits Karst topography --			sinkholes, underground rivers,			and caverns. And the rock strata			contain a high concentration of			thallium compounds, which may be			obstructing our sensor beams.					PICARD			So if Palmer, in his delirium,			fled into a cave, we might be			unable to detect his life signs.					DATA			Correct.					BEVERLY			Captain, if he is still alive,			he probably needs medical			attention. We must send an away			team to locate him.					TROI			But our presence mustn't interfere			with the cultural development of			the Mintakans.					PICARD			Agreed. Further contamination			must be prevented.     STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/9/89 - ACT TWO     16.30   CONTINUED:					RIKER			Sir, I have a suggestion.									CUT TO:31   EXT.

MINTAKA THREE - SECLUDED AREA - DAY (OPTICAL)	The same spot where Liko was beamed down. Riker and	Troi MATERIALIZE, along with two bundles of woven	cloth.	Riker and Troi have been made up as Mintakans,	complete with angled eyebrows and pointed ears.	They're wearing typical Mintakan garb: austere,	mannerly outfits of woven cloth.					RIKER (V.O.)			Doctor Crusher has temporarily			altered our features and skin			color. She's also implanted			subcutaneous communicators so that			any transmissions we receive will			be inaudible to the Mintakans.	Riker and Troi look around. No one's in sight.					RIKER			Riker to Enterprise -- do you			read?	Riker hears Data's com voice via direct bone	conduction, so it sounds unusually thin and faint:					DATA'S COM VOICE				(filtered)			Perfectly, Commander.

" REV. 8/14/89 - ACT TWO    17.32   CONTINUED:	Riker and Troi pick up their bundles of woven cloth.					TROI			Mintakan emotions are quite			interesting. Like the Vulcans,			they have highly ordered minds...			A very sensible people.	They start to walk. Riker automatically takes the	lead. Troi stops him, moves in front of him. MOVE	with them as they walk.					TROI (cont'd)				(enjoying this)			For example, Mintakan women			precede their mates. It's a			signal to other women.					RIKER			"This man's taken; get your own?"					TROI			Not precisely... More like, "if			you want his services, I'm the			one to negotiate with."					RIKER			What kinds of "services?"					TROI			All kinds.					RIKER				(amused)			Ah. They are a sensible race.	Riker and Troi come around a rock formation and find	themselves on a path leading to the assembly hall area.32A  EXT. MINTAKA THREE - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY	A few MINTAKANS are entering the area. Riker and Troi	ENTER and follow the Mintakans toward the assembly	hall.    STAR TREK: "Who Watches... " REV. 8/9/89 - ACT TWO    17A.33   INT. MINTAKA THREE - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY	Assorted MINTAKANS are gathered around Liko and Oji.	This is the "town hall" where Mintakans meet daily --	both to barter and to talk, philosophize, exchange	information, and debate ideas.	Among the listeners is NURIA, an attractive, middle-aged	Mintakan woman who's the leader of this community;	the Mintakans respect her calm, clear-headed	intelligence and give extra weight to her opinions.    STAR TREK: "Who Watches...
