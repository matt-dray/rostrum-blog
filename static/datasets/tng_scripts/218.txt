Data SHUFFLES the cards with android	speed and dexterity.					RIKER				(with humor)			Sometimes I wonder if he's			stacking the deck.					DATA			I assure you, Commander, the cards			have been sufficiently randomized.					WORF			I hope so.	A look between Worf and Data. Data proceeds to deal	one card face-down to each person... then one card	face-up in the order of Riker, Worf, Beverly, and	himself. Data calls the cards like a true dealer,	mimicking the terms he has heard in his years of	poker...	(NOTE: Because the cards will play an important role	in ensuing Acts, they are specified here.)					DATA			An eight. An Ace. A Queen. The			dealer receives a four.	Everyone studies their cards.    STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - REV. 1/9/92 - ACT ONE    4.7    CONTINUED:					WORF			No bet.	Data deals the next round of cards face-up. Beverly is	dealt another Queen.					DATA			A ten. A seven -- no help there.			A pair of "ladies" for the Doctor.			The dealer receives a nine.				(to Beverly)			Doctor, may I remind you that			since you show the highest hand,			you control the next bet.	Beverly throws in a chip.					BEVERLY			I'll bet ten.	Everyone sees the bet. Data deals...					DATA			Jack. Four. Deuce. Six.					BEVERLY				(bets)			Twenty.	Data matches the bet.					RIKER			And I'll raise you fifty.	Reactions. Worf is uncomfortable with the large bet.					WORF			Fifty.					BEVERLY			I'm in.					DATA			I will also see the bet.	Worf grumbles, matches the bet.					DATA				(dealing)			Seven... and a possible straight			for Commander Riker. Jack --			still no help for the Klingon.	Worf bristles at the remark, unhappy with his cards.   STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT ONE   4A.7    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA				(continuing)			Eight. Nine for the dealer.	Beverly glances at Riker's cards... hesitant... tosses	in a few more chips.					BEVERLY			Twenty.    STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - REV. 1/9/92 - ACT ONE    5.7    CONTINUED: (3)					DATA				(folds)			"Too rich for my blood."					RIKER			I'll see your twenty -- and raise			you a hundred.	Riker throws in chips. Worf reacts to the bet,	disgruntled.					WORF			Fold.	Beverly studies Riker -- has a feeling here and goes	for broke... matches his bet...					BEVERLY			And two hundred more.	Riker matches.					RIKER			Two. And another three hundred.	A beat. Worf studies Riker.					WORF			He does not have the straight.	Beverly and Riker match poker faces.					BEVERLY			We'll find out, won't we?	She matches his bet.					BEVERLY			Let's see what you've got.	The moment of truth. Riker turns over his cards,	defeated.					RIKER			Take it.	Reactions as Beverly collects her winnings. Riker's	ego has been bruised. He kicks off a playful	exchange...					RIKER				(to Beverly)			How'd you know I was bluffing?					BEVERLY			I just had a feeling.    STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT ONE    6.7    CONTINUED: (4)					RIKER			I guess it's better to be lucky			than good.					BEVERLY			Or maybe it's the way your left			eyebrow raises slightly when you			bluff.	Riker blanches -- is she kidding? Beverly smiles.					BEVERLY			Just teasing, Commander.					NURSE OGAWA'S COM VOICE			Ogawa to Doctor Crusher.					BEVERLY			Go ahead.					NURSE OGAWA'S COM VOICE			Commander La Forge needs you in			sickbay.					BEVERLY			On my way.	Beverly stands to go...8    INT. SICKBAY	Geordi is sitting on an examination table, while	Beverly scans him with a medical tricorder. She	centers around his ears and head...					GEORDI			At first I thought the catwalk			was spinning. Turns out it was			me.				(beat)			I'm lucky Ensign Fletcher was			there to grab me -- it's a long			way down to the bottom of the warp			core.	Geordi reacts to a sudden pain -- headache. Beverly	completes her exam.					BEVERLY			You have all the symptoms of an			inner-ear infection. That			would explain your dizziness...			and the headache.    STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT ONE    7.8    CONTINUED:	She reaches for a nearby hypospray.					BEVERLY			But I don't see any physical			evidence.				(beat)			My guess is... you've been working			too hard.	Geordi nods, admitting the fact.					GEORDI			I have been putting in extra hours			on the Typhon Expanse survey.	Beverly prepares the hypospray...					BEVERLY			I'll give you twenty cc's of			vertazine -- it'll clear up your			dizziness. But finding time to			relax is up to you...	Beverly stops in mid-sentence, caught by a sudden	awareness -- the feeling that she's done this before...	the examination... the conversation...					GEORDI				(off her look)			What is it?					BEVERLY			Geordi... have you ever had these			symptoms before?					GEORDI				(thinks)			Never.					BEVERLY			You're sure?					GEORDI			Positive. Why?					BEVERLY			It's funny... I get the feeling			that we've discussed these			complaints.				(beat)			I remember giving you a hypospray			for dizziness.      STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE      8.8    CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			I've never had these symptoms			before today. You must be			remembering some other patient.					BEVERLY			No. I'm sure it was you.	Beverly shrugs off the feeling. She administers the	hypospray.					BEVERLY			Try to get some rest. And stay			away from high places for a few			days, just in case.	Geordi stands, appreciative.					GEORDI			Thanks, Doc.					BEVERLY			Goodnight.	Geordi EXITS. Off Beverly's face, as she returns to	her work...9    INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS	Later. Beverly is dressed in her nightclothes, ready	for bed. She passes by a table topped with several	exotic PLANTS, picks up a cutting tool and starts to	snip away the dead leaves. As she does so, she quietly	sings a little song, letting herself unwind. After a	peaceful beat, she puts down the tool, and heads for	bed...10   ANGLE ON BED	Beverly sits down, reaches for a GLASS of water off the	night stand and takes a sip. She turns off the lamp	and the room darkens. She crawls under the covers,	lays her head on the pillow. A quiet moment passes	as Beverly drifts off to sleep...	Then, slowly in the darkness, a barely perceptible	VOICE can be heard. A distant and echoey whisper.	Beverly opens her eyes. Listens. Gradually, a dozen	VOICES fade in -- disembodied murmurs. Creepy. She	sits up, glances around the dark and empty room...   STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - REV. 1/14/92 - ACT ONE   9.10   CONTINUED:	More voices, louder now, all meshing together. Beverly	tries to make out what they are saying -- but they are	unclear.	Alarmed, Beverly turns on the light, accidentally	knocking over the glass -- the glass BREAKS on the	table, startling her.	The voices stop. Beverly catches her breath, shaken...11   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	at impulse.12   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi, Troi, and Beverly. Geordi	is standing next to a WALL MONITOR, which displays a	MAP of the TYPHON EXPANSE. They are wrapping up a	discussion about their mission.					GEORDI			The Typhon Expanse is huge. If			we want to chart the most remote			star system, we'll have to launch			a probe within the next few hours.					RIKER			Fine.				(consults PADD)			What about the luminosity studies?					GEORDI			They may pose a problem...					PICARD			How so?					GEORDI			The flux spectrometers are still			down for realignment.					RIKER			I thought they were supposed to			be back on-line yesterday.					GEORDI			They were, until the stellar			dynamics lab decided they needed			to install new modules.   STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - REV. 1/9/92 - ACT ONE   9A.12   CONTINUED:					DATA			I recommend we use the gravitron			polarimeter instead. It will			perform a similar function.   STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - REV. 1/9/92 - ACT ONE   10.12   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Make it so.	Beverly cuts in, awkward...					BEVERLY			Captain... There's something I'd			like to report.					PICARD			Yes, Doctor?					BEVERLY			I heard... voices in my room last			night. I was alone... so at first			I thought I was imagining things.			But this morning, ten other people			reported hearing them at the same			time I did.					TROI			What were the voices saying?					BEVERLY			I couldn't make them out...	Reactions to the curious news.					RIKER			Data, did the sensors pick up			anything unusual last night?					DATA			No anomalous readings were			reported.					RIKER			When we're through here,			double-check the sensor logs.					DATA			Aye sir.					PICARD			Counselor?					TROI			I sensed nothing out of the			ordinary last night.   STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - REV. 1/14/92 - ACT ONE   11.12   CONTINUED: (3)					GEORDI			Maybe it's a problem with the com			system.					WORF'S COM VOICE			Bridge to Captain Picard.					PICARD			Go ahead.					WORF'S COM VOICE			We are getting unusual readings			-- twenty thousand kilometers off			the port bow.	A concerned glance, then they rise and head for the	door...13   INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS	Picard and the others ENTER the bridge, take stations.	Riker stands near Data, at ops.					PICARD			Report.					RO			Sensors didn't detect the			phenomenon until we were almost			on top of it, sir.					WORF				(off console)			It is a highly localized			distortion in the space-time			continuum.	Reactions -- they don't like the sound of it.					RIKER			On screen.14   INTERCUT: VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	The area of space just ahead is MURKY and DISTORTED.	Reactions to the sight.					PICARD			Back us off, Ensign. Nice and			slow.   STAR TREK: "Cause and Effect" - REV. 1/14/92 - ACT ONE   12.14   CONTINUED:					RO			Aye sir.				(beat)			Captain -- maneuvering thrusters			are not responding.	On the screen, the distortion RIPPLES slightly.					DATA				(off console)			The distortion field is			fluctuating.	Suddenly, the bridge lights FLICKER and GO OUT. The	EMERGENCY LIGHTS come on -- and some of the consoles	LOSE POWER.					GEORDI			All main systems just went down.			Power levels dropping rapidly...					RIKER			Red Alert.	The ship goes to RED ALERT.					DATA			There is an energy build-up in			the distortion field.				(beat)			Something is emerging...	Suddenly, Troi is overwhelmed by a distinct and	horrible feeling.					TROI				(certain)			Captain -- we have to get out of			here now.	Picard looks at her, and then --15   ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	A STARSHIP EMERGES from the murk -- HEADED DIRECTLY	FOR US.
