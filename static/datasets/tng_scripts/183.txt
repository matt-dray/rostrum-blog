Everyone on the	Bridge looks stern and a little disgruntled with him.					PICARD			Ensign, I summoned you almost ten			minutes ago!					WESLEY			Yes, sir, I know, but I was in			the middle of an experiment using			some volatile compounds and I			couldn't just leave them lying			out --					PICARD			Excuses, Mister Crusher?					WESLEY			No, sir, not at all, it was more			of an explanation --     STAR TREK: "Final Mission" - REV. 9/28/90 - TEASER     2.2    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Because I assure you that will			not go over well at Starfleet			Academy.					WESLEY			I know, sir, but --	Then it sinks in. He stares at Picard.					WESLEY			The Academy?					PICARD			I just got the message from			Admiral Nsomeka. She expects			you to report in two weeks.	There are smiles all around as Wesley, nonplussed,	realizes what Picard is saying.					PICARD			A position has opened up in this			year's class. You'll have to work			overtime to catch up, but I have			assured the Commander that you			will be capable of that. Please			don't make a liar of me.					WESLEY			Oh, yes sir! I mean -- no, sir.					PICARD			And as your final mission aboard			the Enterprise... I'd like you			to accompany me to Pentarus while			I try to sort things out with the			miners.	Wesley is amazed -- first the Academy, and now an	expedition with the Captain.					WESLEY			Yes, sir...					PICARD			Mister Riker tells me you've been			studying the effects of outpost			judiciary decisions on Federation			Law.

Chairman Songi, we			will proceed immediately to your			planet.					SONGI			Thank you, Captain Picard...	The screen blinks out. Picard considers logistics.					PICARD			Mister Riker, take the Enterprise			and investigate the problem.			Ensign Crusher and I will proceed			to Pentarus Five.				(to Wes)			The miners have sent a shuttle.			We'll depart in ten minutes.	Wes acknowledges, heads for the Turbolift.4    INT. SHUTTLEBAY TWO	GEORDI emerges from the miners' shuttle -- a small,	ragged vessel that looks like the space equivalent of	"The African Queen". Its pilot, DIRGO, is a	tough-looking humanoid who is weathered and worn enough	to suggest middle-age. Though his appearance is feral,	he will emerge as an intelligent, if inflexible, being.	Ultimately, he is self-serving; Dirgo looks out for	Dirgo, because he's always had to.					GEORDI			Your maneuvering thrusters are			rigged in a configuration I			haven't seen before.	Dirgo gives him a smug look.					DIRGO			My own modification. It's more			efficient. You can study it if			you want...     STAR TREK: "Final Mission" - REV. 9/28/90 - TEASER     5.4    CONTINUED:	At this point, Picard and Wesley enter.					GEORDI				(to Picard)			I've run operational and safety			inspections, Captain. It checks			out. I won't make any claims for			comfort.	Dirgo approaches Picard, sizing him up as he does.					DIRGO			Captain Picard... Captain Dirgo,			of the shuttlecraft "Nenebek".					PICARD			Ah -- Captain. Good to meet you.					WESLEY				(sotto to Geordi)			"Captain?" Of a mining shuttle?	But Dirgo hears him, turns instantly to him.					DIRGO			Yes, Ensign -- Captain. My ship			isn't pretty, and she isn't big			-- but we've logged almost ten			thousand hours together.					PICARD			It seems a very -- sturdy --			craft.					DIRGO			We should go. Will you take Ops,			Captain?					PICARD			I'll let Ensign Crusher perform			that task. I need to study up			on Regalian law.	Dirgo studies Wesley with obvious disdain as they	enter.4A   INT.

Picard is laying broken strips of	the metal hull on the sand.					PICARD			Mister Crusher, any luck with that			tricorder?					WESLEY			I think so, sir. The scanning			range may be limited, but it's			better than nothing.					DIRGO			These were on board, Captain.			They're working.	He produces four phasers, similar to early Enterprise	types. Picard and Wes each take one. Dirgo holsters	the other two.					PICARD			Excellent. Now --				(scanning the distance)			Our communicators may not be able			to get a signal through this			strong a magnetic field... so I've			fashioned an arrow.

He looks like he	could go on for hours.21   WESLEY AND DIRGO	Wesley smiles, then turns and starts off again. Dirgo	watches him, then surreptitiously removes a bottle from	his pocket. It contains a clear liquid; he tips the	bottle and draws deeply on it. Then he covertly	replaces it.22   ON WESLEY	looking at the tricorder. He slows, swings the	instrument from one side to the other, frowning as he	reads the response.
