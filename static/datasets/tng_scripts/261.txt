SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	at impulse.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log, Stardate 47310.2.			We are investigating the			disappearance of the Medical			Transport Fleming somewhere in the			Hekaras Corridor. Our search is			complicated by the unique			properties of this particular			region of space.4    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	PICARD, RIKER, Data, TROI, BEVERLY, WORF, and Geordi	are seated at the conference table. The mood is upbeat --	even though the mission is serious, it's still fairly	routine.					RIKER			The Fleming's last contact with			Starfleet was four days ago. They			didn't report anything out of the			ordinary when they entered the			Corridor...	Riker nods to Data who rises and moves to the large	monitor which is displaying an OKUDAGRAM of a subspace	map of the Hekaras Corridor. The graphic indicates a	long, path-like trail threading its way through several	star systems.					DATA			The unusually intense tetryon			fields in this sector pose a			severe navigational hazard to warpdriven			vessels...	Data indicates the path-like structure on the graphic.      STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - 09/17/93 - ACT ONE      6.4    CONTINUED:					DATA				(continuing)			The Hekaras Corridor is the only			route through the area which is			free of tetryon fields. Ships			travelling at warp must use the			Corridor to ensure safe passage			through the region.					PICARD			How long will it take to complete			a level-one search?					DATA			At least two days, sir. The			Corridor is over twelve lightyears			long, and the surrounding			tetryon interference will limit			our sensor range.	Picard nods and Data takes his seat.					WORF			Could we send out reconnaissance			probes to supplement the sensors?					GEORDI			They won't be very effective. The			interference will make it			difficult to maintain contact with			the probes; the best we can do is			to try increasing the sensor			efficiency.				(beat; to Picard)			We're installing multi-phase			buffers on all the sensor modules.			It should help a little.	Troi, meanwhile, has been studying the graphic.					TROI			Hekaras Two is inhabited, isn't			it? Maybe they've had contact			with the Fleming.	Riker shakes his head.					RIKER			They haven't. I've already spoken			with the Hekaran government.					(MORE)   STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - REV. 09/24/93 - ACT ONE   7.4    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER (Cont'd)			According to them, only one ship			has passed through their system in			the last week... and that was a			Ferengi trader.	Beverly reacts.					BEVERLY			The Fleming was carrying a supply			of bio-mimetic gel... it's rare			and quite valuable. Do you think			it's possible the Ferengi could			have hijacked it?					RIKER				(considers)			I wouldn't put it past them.				(beat; to Picard)			We should be prepared for that			contingency.					PICARD			Agreed.	Picard makes his decisions.					PICARD				(continuing)			All right then. Mister Worf,			initiate your search pattern.			Let's head in.	The meeting breaks up.                                             CUT TO:4A   INT. ENGINEERING	Geordi is at the warp core. The DILITHIUM CHAMBER is	open and he is working intently on the innards with a	TECH TOOL. Several N.D.s are working in the b.g.	Data ENTERS and moves to Geordi.					DATA			Geordi, we have experienced a			slight drop in sensor efficiency.			Commander Riker would like us to			examine the phase buffers.	Geordi does not look up from his work immediately.   STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - REV. 09/24/93 - ACT ONE   7A.4A   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			No problem, Data... I'll be with			you in a minute...	Geordi works another beat and then turns to an N.D.					GEORDI				(continuing)			All right, Hansen, transfer EPS			conduit thirteen through the			stabilizer matrix.					VOICE (O.C.)			Aye, sir.	Geordi closes the chamber, moves to another console and	continues working. Data follows him, curious.					DATA			Geordi, is there a problem with			the engines?					GEORDI			No, not really...					DATA			Then why are you stabilizing the			EPS conduit?	A beat. Geordi looks up from the console.					GEORDI			I'm just trying to get a slightly			higher power conversion level...					DATA				(considering it)			That would not affect the engines			in any way.					GEORDI			I know. That's not the point.	Data seems puzzled.   STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - REV. 09/24/93 - ACT ONE   7B.4A   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			Then... what is "the point?"					GEORDI				(a bit evasive)			I just... want the best conversion			level I can get.					DATA			Why?	There is a beat. Somewhat reluctantly...					GEORDI			It's the Intrepid.				(off Data's reaction)			Their Chief Engineer is Commander			Donald Kaplan. We went through			the Academy together. And... I			kind of like to make sure our			power conversion level is... a			little higher than theirs.					DATA			I understand. You are in			competition with Mister Kaplan.	Geordi doesn't want to admit to that.					GEORDI			No, it's not really a			competition...				(beat)			This is the flagship. It just			seems to me -- we should be better			than the rest.					DATA			That does sound like a competitive			position.					GEORDI			It's more a matter of personal			pride. I mean... these are my			engines.					DATA			But you are trying to outperform			the Intrepid.   STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - REV. 09/24/93 - ACT ONE   7C.4A   CONTINUED: (3)					GEORDI			Well... yeah.	Geordi works the console for a beat.					GEORDI			Computer. How much have the			conversion levels increased?					COMPUTER VOICE			Levels are unchanged.	Geordi's frustration is evident as Data waits	patiently.					GEORDI			All right, we'll deal with of this			later...	Geordi grabs a TECH TOOL and moves toward the Jefferies	tube.					GEORDI				(continuing)			Let's take a look at those			sensors.	Data and Geordi EXIT into the Jefferies tube.5    INT. JEFFERIES TUBE	Geordi and Data are moving through a section of the	VERTICAL JEFFERIES TUBE. They stop at a junction, and	Geordi opens a MEESPANEL. He begins to work on it with	a TECH TOOL as Data monitors his progress with a	TRICORDER.					GEORDI			Okay -- how's that?					DATA			The phase buffer is functioning			within normal parameters. Sensor			efficiency has increased six-point-seven			percent.   STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - REV. 09/23/93 - ACT ONE   8.5    CONTINUED:	Geordi closes the panel, still not quite satisfied.					GEORDI			Only six-point-seven? One of the			stages must still be out of			alignment...				(beat)			Let's check out junction A-nine.	Data acknowledges and they begin to climb down the	tube.					DATA			Geordi, I have taken your			suggestion regarding Spot.					GEORDI			What suggestion?					DATA			I have begun to train her. I am			currently testing several			techniques.	Geordi isn't really interested to hear about Data's	cat.					GEORDI			Really...	Data continues talking as they move into a horizontal	section...6    ANOTHER JEFFERIES TUBE - HORIZONTAL SECTION	Moving along the tube...					DATA			I began with simple conditioned			response exercises and followed			with various environmental			enhancements. Next I intend to			explore bio-conditioning devices.					GEORDI			Devices?					DATA			Such as sensor nets for behavior			modification... or bio-feedback			motivators...				(beat)			Unfortunately, I have been largely			unsuccessful...   STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - REV. 09/23/93 - ACT ONE   9.6    CONTINUED:	Geordi stops at a MEESPANEL and opens it up. He takes	out his (TECH) tool and begins working.					GEORDI				(kidding)			How about a phaser? A low stun			setting at the right moment might			do the trick...	Data reacts -- he's taking the suggestion seriously.					DATA			Geordi. I will not stun my cat.					GEORDI			I was just kidding...	Geordi works for another moment, then closes the panel.					GEORDI			This isn't it, either.					DATA			There is clearly a misalignment			somewhere in this system.					GEORDI			That's for sure...				(thinks)			There's one more possibility...			let's take a look at junction C-twelve...	They move off down the tube...6A   JEFFERIES TUBE - ANOTHER SECTION	moving along the tube...					DATA			I am somewhat concerned that my			training efforts will ultimately			fail...					GEORDI			Well, maybe you're just going			about it the wrong way.   STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - REV. 09/23/93 - ACT ONE   9A.6A   CONTINUED:					DATA			I have consulted numerous animal			behavior manuals; several of them			claim that cats are inherently			untrainable.					GEORDI			I don't believe that. My sister			didn't know a thing about animals			and she was able to train her cat.			How complicated could it be?					DATA				(curious)			What did she train her cat to do?					GEORDI				(thinks about it)			Well... her cat would jump into			her arms on command.	Data is intrigued by the notion.					DATA			That is interesting. Perhaps I			could modify your sister's			technique to keep Spot off my			console. Do you know how she was			able to train her cat?					GEORDI				(amused)			Well, as I recall, she had to walk			around for about two months with			a piece of tuna in her blouse...	Data reacts.	In the meantime, they have reached another MEESPANEL.	Geordi opens it and checks it out...					GEORDI			I was right... this buffer is out			of alignment...				(beat, works)			All right... how's that?	Data scans the panel with his tricorder.					DATA			The phase alignment is			stabilizing...					(MORE)   STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - REV. 09/23/93 - ACT ONE   9B.6A   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA (Cont'd)				(beat)			However, sensor efficiency has			only increased an additional one-point-three			percent.					GEORDI			Well, that's not much, but every			little bit helps.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Riker to Data.					DATA				(taps combadge)			Data here.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			We're picking up a ship ahead on			long range sensors. If you and			Geordi are through down there,			we'd like to have you on the			Bridge.   STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - REV. 09/23/93 - ACT ONE   10.6A   CONTINUED: (3)	Data looks at Geordi who closes the panel.					GEORDI			We've squeezed as much out of			these systems as we're going to			get.					DATA				(to com)			Acknowledged, sir. We are on our			way.	Data moves off down the tube. Geordi takes one last,	satisfied look at his repair and then follows Data down	the tube.                                             CUT TO:7    INT.

Their			warp drive must be completely			inactive.					DATA				(off console)			That is correct, sir. Their			impulse systems appear to be down			as well... power generation is at			extremely low levels.					PICARD			What about life signs?					DATA				(off console)			Life support is also functioning,			at low levels.

What are we going			to do about this one?					GEORDI			Unfortunately, right now there's			not much we can do.					RABAL			My planet is not in immediate			danger, but the gravitational			shifts are already beginning to			affect its orbit. Our climate is			changing.					PICARD			Starfleet is setting up a weather			control network for Hekaras Two.			It's only a temporary solution,			but it should suffice for now.					RIKER			We were lucky the rift formed as			far away from the planet as it			did. At least we have a little			time to consider our options.	A beat as the scale of the problem sinks in.					PICARD			If there are no further questions,			you're dismissed.	As the group files out of the room, Picard rises and	moves to the window and looks out into space. Geordi	notices this and lingers behind. He moves to Picard.					GEORDI			We should have the thermal			stabilizers ready for the Hekarans			in another day, sir.					PICARD			Very well.	There's a long beat before Picard continues.       STAR TREK: "Force of Nature" - REV. 09/20/93 - ACT FIVE      56.67   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD (Cont'd)				(beat)			But now I can't help but wonder if			all the while I was really helping			to destroy the very thing I hold			dear.	Geordi's reply is firm and confident.					GEORDI			It's not going to turn out that			way, sir. We still have time to			make it better.	There's a silent moment between them. Off their	reactions.68   EXT.
