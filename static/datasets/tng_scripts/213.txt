I am Aaron Conor...					PICARD			Mister Conor, we were unaware of			any Human colony in this system.					CONOR			Captain, I don't want to be rude			but we don't wish to interact with			outsiders. I have only responded			because of your warning.					PICARD			The fragment will begin to have			serious effects on your planet			in six days.					CONOR			Yes, I know. We have been			tracking it. But our biosphere			has been constructed to withstand			quakes of eight-point-seven on			the Richter Scale.					RIKER			Mister Data... ?					DATA				(to viewscreen)			The fragment has a density of one			hundred billion kilograms per cubic			centimeter. As a result, when it			passes Moab Four, it will cause			tectonic shifts well beyond			eight-point-seven on the Richter			Scale.					PICARD			I'm afraid we're going to have			to evacuate your people.					CONOR			Evacuate? That's not possible.			There must be an alternative...					RIKER			The alternative, sir, is dying...     STAR TREK: "Masterpiece Society" - 11/5/91 - TEASER     5.3    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Mister Conor, if you wish, we will			find you another isolated planet			that is safe.					CONOR			No, we must remain here.					RIKER			Maybe we haven't made ourselves			clear...					CONOR			Of course, you have, Commander...			and I hope I've made myself clear			that we must seek an alternative			solution...					PICARD				(with diplomacy)			We will gladly explore the			possibility with you, Mister			Conor... would you care to come			aboard to discuss it?					CONOR			Our environment is sealed. No			one can get in or out.					PICARD			We are capable of matter/energy			transport...					CONOR			Matter/energy?					PICARD			We can take you directly through			the structure.					CONOR				(reacts)			Really. That's quite remarkable.					PICARD				(genial, inviting)			May we arrange for your transport?					CONOR			No. I must stay here.    STAR TREK: "Masterpiece...

That's			becoming more clear by the moment.				(beat)			What is your status with him			presently?					TROI			I did not intend to see him again.					PICARD			Would you prefer not to return			to the surface?					TROI			I think I should come with you.			But I wanted you to know before			we went down.					PICARD			I appreciate that.	He looks at her for a beat, gives her room for more...	she feels awful about this... she's almost on the verge	of tears...					TROI			I wanted so much to help him, to			be there for him... but the more			I was...	Troi shakes her head.

You see,			Captain, I know what Hannah Bates			is feeling. For I have been			feeling it as well. I found...			your people to be... intriguing			and stimulating... as she did.			I was every bit as curious about			you as the next man.				(beat)			But I am not the next man.

They are the ones who			inherit the social chaos that			would follow for generations.				(beat)			Your arrival created this problem.			Your departure solves it.					PICARD			That is simplistic.					CONOR			Refuse them passage.					PICARD			I cannot ignore the requests of			people, Humans who ask for			transport away from here...					CONOR			Nor can you ignore the fact that			thousands will suffer if you agree			to take them.
