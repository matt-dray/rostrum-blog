We died at			Khitomer.	Worf looks at them for an explanation.					GI'RAL			We were captured.

After a beat:					WORF			I understand your desire to			preserve your families' honor.			But what of your own? There is no			honor in remaining prisoners.					L'KOR			We lost our honor when we were			captured. It does not matter what			happens to us.					GI'RAL			All that matters is that our			families are not dishonored.	One of the Elders has been going through Worf's	backpack and steps forward to give L'Kor something he	found -- it is Worf's COMBADGE.  STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

The world			outside these walls no longer			exists for us. We do not speak of			it.					GI'RAL			You should try to forget that			world as well.	L'Kor regards Worf sadly.					L'KOR			Why did you come here, Worf? If			you had found your father... you			would have found only dishonor.					WORF			If he had been captured as you			were, if I had found him here...			I would be glad to see him. There			would be no room in my heart for			shame.	L'Kor takes this in, his expression unreadable.					L'KOR			Much has changed since Khitomer.			I can only hope that if my son			came here... he would be Klingon			enough to kill me.     STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

COMPOUND (DAY)3    OMITTED4    ANGLE - WORF	He is sitting alone on a BENCH to one side of the	compound, surveying it. He looks around at the	activity in the compound -- a young man is gardening;	a group of young people run and play a game; three men	play a game with dice.	People go about their business, occasionally casting	surreptitious glances at the stranger in their midst.	Every time Worf's eye meets someone else's, they seem	to turn away and return to what they were doing.	This place is more a village than a prison -- flowers	are planted near the well tended barracks; the wall	that once served to pen prisoners is still there, but	the gate is left open and people come and go at will.	While there are several generations of Klingons in the	camp, the only Romulans are the middle-aged guards who	have been at this post for the last twenty years. Worf	is the first person they've had to guard in a long time	and they have to remind themselves to keep an eye on	him and not be distracted by the goings on in the camp.  STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt. II" - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT ONE  6.4    CONTINUED:	Worf stands and begins to walk the perimeter of the	compound wall, eyeing possible avenues of escape. The	Guards keep a watchful eye.	Worf's path takes him past a young man tending a	vegetable patch at one end of the compound. The young	man, TOQ, looks up from his hoeing, but when he sees	it's Worf he resumes his work as if he has no interest	in the stranger.	Worf is about to continue his reconnoitering when he	notices what Toq is using to hoe the ground: an	elaborately carved Klingon BATTLE SPEAR.	Without hesitation, Worf marches toward him and	snatches it from his hand.					WORF			This is a Gin'tak spear.					TOQ				(reaching for it)			What of it?	Worf is outraged.					WORF			Have your parents taught you			nothing? This is used for battle --			not for tilling soil.  STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt. II" - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT ONE  7.4    CONTINUED: (2)					TOQ			We have no need for weapons here.			The war is far away.					WORF			What war?					TOQ				(it's obvious)			The war our parents came here to			escape.	Worf realizes that the young people have not been told	everything.					WORF			That war... has been over for			years.	Toq looks at him skeptically, and snatches the spear	back from him -- Worf doesn't resist.					TOQ			I'm not interested in what you			have to say, Klingon. I have work			to do.	He turns away and resumes his hoeing. Worf watches him	for a moment, then walks away, dismayed by the young	man's total ignorance of his culture.	He looks over at the Romulan Guards and sees that they	have been watching the whole thing. They seem a bit on	edge, as if uncertain how to react to the stranger's	behavior. Worf decides to play it cool so as not to	provoke them. He returns to where he was sitting	before.	After a moment, Worf looks up and sees that BA'EL, the	young woman he saw in the woods, is looking at him.	She is the first person in the camp to hold his gaze,	and Worf returns it without realizing it... suddenly	they both become embarrassed and look away.	After a beat, she approaches him.					BA'EL			Hello again, Worf.  STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt. II" - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT ONE  8.4    CONTINUED: (3)	Worf acknowledges with a curt nod.					BA'EL			They say you're going to stay here			with us.	Worf realizes she too hasn't been told everything.					WORF			Not by choice.					BA'EL			Aren't you happy to escape the			war?	Worf looks at her, beginning to realize the extent of	the lie they've been told.					WORF			The war...					BA'EL			Yes... we've heard the stories all			our lives. How people are			slaughtered in terrible battles...			forced to fight, whether they want			to or not. That's why our parents			came here -- to make a safe			home... a place where they could			raise their children in peace.				(beat)			I should think you'd be relieved			to get away from the fighting.			You're safe here.					WORF			A place can be safe -- and still			be a prison. Where I come from,			people are free to come and go as			they choose.	Ba'el thinks he's misread the situation. Ingenuously --					BA'EL			So are we.	Worf regards the young woman.					WORF			Tell your Father you would like to			leave. Tell him you want to visit			the Klingon home world. See what			he says.    STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt. II" - 12/22/92 - ACT ONE    9.4    CONTINUED: (4)	Ba'el looks at him, considers. There is something	almost defensive in her voice when she replies.					BA'EL			Why would I want to go there?			It's dangerous.					WORF			Not any longer.	Suddenly Gi'ral calls out to her daughter from across	the compound.					GI'RAL				(off-camera)			Ba'el! Come here!	Ba'el and Worf look up and see Gi'ral heading toward	them.					BA'EL			Yes, mother.				(to Worf)			You are not allowed to leave the			compound?	Worf shakes his head no. She stands.					BA'EL				(flirting)			Then I suppose I won't be seeing			you at the pond again.	Worf looks away uncomfortably and she smiles and moves	toward her mother.					GI'RAL				(a harsh whisper)			I told you not to speak with him.					BA'EL			I'm sorry, mother.    STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt. II" - 12/22/92 - ACT ONE    10.4    CONTINUED: (5)	With a last glance back at Worf, Ba'el crosses away	with her Mother.	After a moment, TWO FAINT BEEPS are heard. Worf	touches the TRANSPONDER hidden in his hem, then stands	and crosses toward his quarters.5    INT. WORF'S QUARTERS	Worf ENTERS and takes out the TRANSPONDER Shrek gave	him. It is FLASHING, indicating that Shrek's shuttle	has returned.	Worf hides the TRANSPONDER again and considers his	options. He crosses to the light control panel and	inspects it. He pries it off the wall with his fingers	in order to get at the circuity inside. He removes a	piece of circuitry and begins to reconfigure it.	The sound of approaching footsteps prompts him to close	the panel and move to his bunk.	There is a knock at the door.					WORF			Enter.	The door swings open to reveal a middle-aged Romulan	standing there. It is TOKATH, the officer mentioned by	Gi'ral and L'Kor.					TOKATH			I am Tokath.	Worf reacts to the name, but says nothing.					TOKATH			I can return later if I am			disturbing you... ?	Worf fixes him with a look.					WORF			It is a strange thing when a			jailer concerns himself with his			prisoner's comfort.					TOKATH				(smiles)			Mine is a strange prison. STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt. II" - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT ONE 11.5    CONTINUED:					WORF			You robbed the Klingons of who			they were. You dishonored them.					TOKATH				(challenging)			By not slitting their throats when			we found them unconscious?					WORF			I don't expect you to understand.			You are a Romulan.					TOKATH			You're just like L'Kor was twenty			years ago. Proud and angry. He			hated me; all the Klingons did.			And I had no love for them -- I			won't deny it.				(beat)			When I informed the High Command			that the Klingons wanted to remain			here... I was told that unless I			stayed to oversee them myself,			they would be killed.				(beat)			My decision ended my military			career.					WORF			Why did you do it?	Tokath regards him for a beat.					TOKATH			I don't expect you to understand.			You're a Klingon.	Worf stares at him, perplexed by this complicated man.					TOKATH			But I do expect you to understand			this: we've put aside the old			hatreds. Here, Romulans and			Klingons live in peace. I won't			allow you to destroy what we have.					WORF			Do not deceive yourself. These			people are not happy here. I see			sadness in their eyes.					TOKATH			That's not what I see when I look			in my wife's eyes. STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt. II" - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT ONE 12.5    CONTINUED: (2)	Worf looks up sharply. Tokath regards him solemnly.					TOKATH			I married a Klingon.	Worf reacts.					TOKATH			So you see, when I warn you not to			disrupt our lives here, I'm not			speaking just as a jailer... but			as a man protecting his family.	He fixes Worf with a look.					TOKATH			Do not test my tolerance.	He turns on his heel and EXITS, leaving Worf still	reeling from his revelation.6    EXT. COMPOUND (DAY)	A Klingon woman puts an empty container in a storage	barrel set against the compound wall.	Worf sees her, then looks over to see if the guards are	looking at him. He ambles his way toward the barrel as	if heading in no particular direction.	When he's near it, he checks to make sure he isn't	being watched and tosses the circuitry he took from the	light panel into the barrel.	He crosses over to where Ba'el is sitting with a woman	who is rocking her CHILD to sleep in her arms. Ba'el	is softly signing a lullaby in Klingon.	Worf recognizes the words as being the same as the aria	L'Kor sang the first night. As before, there is	something about the way it is being sung that makes him	frown slightly.					BA'EL			Bagh Da tuHmoh. ChojaH Duh rHo.			ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo			van'aj javDIch Qong DIr Sa'VIch			ghIH yot quelI'Pa qevas HoH Qa	She looks up when he approaches and smiles as she	finishes the gentle melody -- the child is asleep. STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt. II" - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT ONE 13.6    CONTINUED:					WORF			Do you know what that song means?					BA'EL			No. I just like the melody.	Worf is disturbed to hear this. Suddenly there is an	EXPLOSION in the barrel. Everyone rushes toward it to	see what is happening except Worf. He backs away until	he's near the wall, then turns and begins to climb it.	Ba'el looks back to see where Worf is, and catches a	glimpse of him as he skips over the wall. Her heart	leaps to her throat but she says nothing... he is gone.	Suddenly one of the Romulans spies Worf and trips a	warning KLAXON.7    EXT.

Some go around, some	through.13   WORF	as he hides in some fronds. Two booted figures pass	within feet of him as they search for him. When	they're gone, he steals away in another direction.14   HIS PURSUERS	as they catch sight of him through a break in the	foliage and resume their chase.15   WORF	as he comes to a clearing and sees a figure standing on	the other side -- it is SHREK, the alien who brought	him to the planet. Through the foliage, we catch a	glimmer of his shuttle's hull.16   SHREK	as he waves Worf to come toward him. Suddenly a look	of concern crosses his features.17   WORF	as he reacts to the change of expression on Shrek's	face -- too late. Suddenly he's tackled to the ground	by a figure that lunges into the frame.    STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

Toq and a Romulan	guard stand off to the side, weapons in hand.					TOKATH			I have alerted the Romulan border			patrols to be on the lookout for			a Yridian ship.					L'KOR			If it escapes... others will learn			that we're here.					TOKATH			I've ordered surveillance stepped			up. If there are more intruders,			we'll stop them.	Tokath signals the guards. Toq and the Romulan step	forward. The Romulan aims his weapon at Worf's head so	that he won't resist, and Toq grabs Worf's arm and	pulls his sleeve up.	Tokath pulls a HYPO type device from his pocket.					TOKATH			We haven't had to use one of these			in a long time.	He holds the device to Worf's skin and administers an	injection.					TOKATH			It implants a small boridium			pellet under the skin... we can			use its energy signature to track			you.	Worf looks down at his arm with a grim expression.	L'Kor regards him, his face almost sympathetic.					L'KOR			In time, you will grow accustomed			to life here.	Worf looks at him with undisguised distaste. STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

Realizing he has to get hold of himself,	he takes a deep breath and straightens his spine. He	holds two fingers together and passes them down along	the length of his torso -- this is the first movement	of the Mok'bara, the Klingon martial art we saw him	doing in Part One.	He begins to do the forms of the ritual exercise --	deliberate and controlled, centering himself.26   INTERCUT WITH BYSTANDERS	as they begin to notice what the stranger is doing.	Several teenaged Klingons watch Worf in fascination.	Ba'el comes to see what they are looking at, as does	Toq -- though everybody keeps their distance.	Ba'el decides to approach Worf.					BA'EL			What are you doing?	Worf leans into a forward thrust and holds the	position.					WORF			The Mok'bara... STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

He does another movement, slowly -- a	second time for her benefit. She mimics it, and Worf	notices TWO YOUNG MEN at a distance, trying the forms	themselves. After a hesitant glance at each other,	they cross over to him.	Behind them, Toq looks on... concerned.					WORF				(to the gathered young				 people)			This is the Mok'bara... a great			warrior called Kahless invented			the forms when he went to the			underworld in search of his			father.

COMPOUND (NIGHT)	Worf is recounting a Klingon myth around the campfire.	His listeners are mostly young people, including Ba'el,	their faces in rapt attention as he tells the story.	An old Klingon woman sits nearby, listening and	nodding. Toq sits further away, smirking to himself at	the parts of the story he finds less than credible.					WORF			... Kahless held his father's			lifeless body in his arms. He			could not believe what his brother			had done. Then his brother threw			their father's sword into the sea,			saying that if he could not			possess it, neither would Kahless.			That was the last time the			brothers would speak.31   REVEAL L'KOR	standing in the shadows, listening with some concern.32   SCENE					BA'EL			What happened to the sword?					WORF			Kahless looked into the ocean and			wept, for the sword was all he had			left of his father... and the sea			filled with his tears and flooded			beyond the shore.	Toq scoffs to himself.   STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

Not for			Kahless. He was a great warrior.					TOQ			You're making it up.					WORF			These are our stories. They tell			us who we are.	The old woman nods to herself. Suddenly L'Kor's voice	rings out.					L'KOR			It is late. It is time to sleep.	The young people grumble a little but stand to go.	Ba'el gives Worf a long look as she leaves. L'Kor	stands there until the young people are all gone... his	eyes locked on Worf's. They face off, as if a silent	battle is engaged. At last, L'Kor turns and disappears	into the shadows.33   EXT.

He's amazed at this seemingly new	ability.					TOQ			Yes... I can smell it.	Worf nods approvingly.					WORF			Remember the scent. More than			anything else, it will guide you.					TOQ			It's strong.

Warriors.	Toq looks at Worf, grateful for what he has shared.					TOQ			I was never taught that...					WORF			There is much you were never			taught.	There is a sudden rustling in the brush, and Worf's	senses quicken. He gestures for silence, then moves	forward. Toq stares after him for a beat, struck by	what Worf has said. STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt. II" - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT FOUR 41.48   INT. MEETING HALL (NIGHT)	Where the Klingons and Romulans have gathered to eat.	Tokath sits with the Klingon Elders at the head of the	table, Gi'ral and Ba'el sit nearby. Over the years,	the Klingons have learned to eat with less	boisterousness than is typical.	Tokath is eating with relish, but L'Kor is picking at	his food; he is concerned about Worf and Toq's	continued absence. Tokath realizes this.					TOKATH			Aren't you hungry, L'Kor?				(beat)			Or are you upset because your			prisoner hasn't returned?					L'KOR			I should not have sent the boy			with him. If he's been hurt --					TOKATH			Don't worry, my friend. They'll			be back... after all, a warrior			keeps his word. Isn't that so?	The sarcasm is so mild as to go unnoticed, but L'Kor	notices. He stirs his food some more. Ba'el regards	the two men... decides to ask a risky question.					BA'EL			Father... if I wanted to visit			Romulus, or the Klingon Home world --			would I be allowed to go?	A silence falls over the table. Tokath and Gi'ral	exchange a look.	Suddenly, Worf and Toq burst into the room. Toq has	the skinned CARCASS of a dead animal slung over his	shoulder. He smiles broadly at the stunned diners.					TOQ			Ka'la!	He swings the carcass off his shoulder and slaps it	onto the center of the table.					TOQ			Tonight we eat well.	Tokath stands, his voice icy. STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt. II" - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT FOUR 42.48   CONTINUED:					TOKATH			Get that off my table.	All eyes turn to see how Toq will react. He looks at	Tokath, his face unreadable.					TOQ			You do not kill an animal unless			you intend to eat it.					TOKATH				(firm)			Get rid of it.	Toq and Tokath face off.					TOQ			I intend to, Tokath.	He looks around the room.					TOQ			But not until it's cooked.	He breaks into a broad smile. Several of the older	Klingons recognize this very Klingon brand of humor and	break into a hearty, table pounding laugh.					TOQ			Today I learned the ritual hunt.			But that is not all I learned. I			discovered that warrior's blood			runs in my veins.	He looks over the assembled group, who watch him,	riveted.					TOQ			I do not know how or why, but we			have forgotten ourselves. Our			stories are not told, our songs			are not sung.				(gesturing to Worf)			Tonight as we came home, we sang			a song of victory -- a song known			to me only as a lullaby.

Tokath	and L'Kor share a look of concern. The Romulan looks	over at his daughter and sees that she too has joined	in.					TOKATH			Ba'el!	But she doesn't hear.					THE GROUP			teblaw'nghu mughato'Du ylja'Qo			ylja'Qo! ylja'Qo!!	They begin to repeat it a second time. Tokath looks	over to L'Kor and is disturbed to see that he is	absently mouthing along, without even realizing it.	He looks to Gi'Ral for support, and though she is not	singing, he sees that her eyes are shining, that she is	moved by the words.	Worf and Toq stand at the end of the table, leading the	song. Tokath's eyes catch Worf's and their gazes lock.	Tokath's look carries a warning: stop this or face the	consequences. But Worf continues to lead the song.	We go out on the rousing chords of the song, and Worf's	defiant look as he leads this Klingon rebellion.                                             FADE OUT.                         END ACT FOUR                            STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

The room has been cleared; only Worf and Tokath	remain, facing off. Tokath regards Worf solemnly for	a beat, then paces away from him, musing, troubled.					TOKATH			Well, Worf... you've had quite an			effect on the young people.	Worf's eyes bore into Tokath. He senses this is the	ultimate confrontation between the two.					WORF			I have done nothing more than show			them what they are.					TOKATH			No. You have shown them what you			want them to be.	Tokath moves close to Worf.					TOKATH			Tell me this: do you know of any			place, any time in history that			Klingons and Romulans have lived			together in peace?	Worf is silent; he has no answer.					TOKATH			We have despised each other...			fought each other... for			centuries.	He pauses, eyeing Worf.					TOKATH			Except here. On this remote			planet... Romulans and Klingons			live together in harmony.				(beat)			No government, no leader, has ever			done what I have done here.     STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

They have			lost their heritage.					TOKATH			In what way? A few stories not			told... a few songs not sung...			not a great loss, when compared to			our living in peace.	Tokath's argument is logical, intellectual. But Worf's	perspective is something deeply, passionately felt.					WORF			Those are our rituals... they			define us. They tell us what we			came from... what our children			will grow to be. Without			traditions, we have no identity --			we have no pride.	Tokath makes a scoffing sound.					TOKATH			Klingon pride. Is it really so			valuable? Or is it just a tired			habit...	Worf moves toward Tokath, eyes burning.					WORF			Today Toq went with me on the			ritual hunt... I saw what happened			to him when he caught the scent of			his prey on the wind... for the			first time in his life, he felt			powerful... that's what he has			been denied by living here...			that's what you have tried to take			away from him.					(MORE)        STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

What more is there than			what they have here? Would you			really suggest they go into a			universe where some would hate			them -- simply because of who they			are? Those traditions and rituals			you cherish so much would not			allow them to remain friends with			Romulans.	Tokath moves closer, eyes locked on Worf.					TOKATH			Enough of this. We could talk all			night and not convince the other.				(beat)			I offer you a choice.

Then, she withdraws the HYPO device	they used to implant the tracking pellet.					BA'EL			I will remove the tracking device.			You can go over the wall and hide			in the jungle.	She moves toward him, but he catches her wrist and	stops her.					WORF			Why are you doing this?	She hesitates, not meeting his eye. Then --					BA'EL			My father is wrong.				(beat)			No matter how I might feel about			you, you don't deserve to die.	He holds her wrist until she looks up at him.					WORF			I am not going to run away, Ba'el.	She stares at him in disbelief.					BA'EL			They will kill you.     STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

COMPOUND (DAY)	Everyone in the camp is gathered in the central square.	They wait, talking quietly among themselves.	Worf is brought from his quarters by two Romulans.	When he emerges, the crowd falls silent. This is not	a bloodthirsty mob, but a group of people doing what	they believe is best for the community, whatever their	personal feelings might be for the condemned man.	As he is led toward the compound wall, Worf is brought	past Tokath and the Elders. The Romulan's face is	steely, but L'Kor can't meet Worf's eyes.     STAR TREK: "Birthright, Pt.

Tokath	steps forward and speaks in a voice loud enough for all	to hear, trying to head off the possibility that Worf	be seen as a martyr.					TOKATH			I know there are those among you			who may question what I'm about to			do. And you would not be wrong to			do so.	He walks slowly among the crowd, addressing them as	friends.					TOKATH			I have questioned myself...
