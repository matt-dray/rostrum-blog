SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	orbiting a RED GIANT GASEOUS PLANET.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log, Stardate 46271.5.			The Enterprise has entered orbit			of Deinonychus Seven. But our			scheduled rendezvous with the			supply ship Biko has been delayed			for another forty-eight hours.2    OMITTED3    INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS	PICARD is sitting in a chair, playing a quiet MELODY	on his FLUTE (as seen in "The Inner Light"). Over the	com system, two other instruments can be heard -- a	CLARINET and a CELLO. Picard is playing along with	the music form a pleasant harmony.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			In the meantime, many members of			the crew are taking advantage of			the delay to pursue their own			projects... myself included.	After a few measures, Picard stops playing -- something	doesn't sound quite right.					PICARD				(to computer)			Computer -- stop playback.	The music STOPS.					PICARD				(continuing)			Change the clarinet to an oboe.			Continue recording.  STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - REV. 9/18/92 - TEASER  1A.3    CONTINUED:	Picard listens as the music PLAYS BACK -- the same	melody, but now the CLARINET is an OBOE. He begins to	play the flute along with the music...	The door CHIMES.     STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - TEASER     2.3    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD				(to computer)			Pause program.	The music STOPS. Picard sets his flute aside.					PICARD			Come.	GEORDI and DATA ENTER. Geordi is enthusiastic about	something.					GEORDI			Captain -- we'd like permission			to take the Engineering computer			off-line for a couple of hours.				(beat)			We've been working on a new			interface that'll allow Data to			act as an emergency back-up in			case of a ship-wide systems			failure.					DATA			In theory, my neural network			should be able to sustain key			systems until primary control is			restored.	Picard considers -- it sounds like an interesting	notion, but he's not really in the mood for talking	tech.					PICARD			It sounds like an intriguing			experiment. I'll be very			interested to see the results.				(beat)			Permission granted.	Excited by the prospects, Geordi continues...   STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - REV. 9/18/92 - TEASER   3.3    CONTINUED: (3)					GEORDI			It's possible we may even be able			to run secondary systems through			Data. Weapons control... sensor			arrays...	Picard nods, growing slightly impatient.					PICARD			Yes. I get the idea, Mister La			Forge. Thank you. Please			proceed.	Geordi nods and EXITS with Data. Picard takes a moment	to clear his thoughts... then picks up his flute.					PICARD				(to computer)			Computer -- record again from the			first measure.	The other two MUSIC tracks start to play. He takes a	breath... then begins to PLAY the tranquil flute melody	again... a few measures go by...	The door CHIMES. Picard stops playing, slightly	annoyed.					PICARD			Computer -- pause program.	The music STOPS.					PICARD			Come.	BEVERLY ENTERS. She looks determined about something.					BEVERLY			Jean-Luc, I need to talk with you			about "Something for Breakfast."	Picard looks her, at a loss.					BEVERLY				(prompting)			The play.	Picard nods, remembering -- tries to ease out of the	subject.					PICARD			Ah... yes... a very intriguing			drama. But I really don't have			the time it would take to learn			a part. And anyway, I'm not much			of an actor...     STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - TEASER     4.3    CONTINUED: (4)					BEVERLY			That's no problem. You wouldn't			be playing one of the leads.	Picard is surprised -- and just a little hurt.					PICARD			Oh.					BEVERLY			It's a very small part. Only two			lines in the whole play.					PICARD			Really.					BEVERLY			You play the butler.	A long beat.					PICARD			Let me read the play again...			and I'll let you know.					BEVERLY			You'll be wonderful, Jean-Luc.			Rehearsal's at one thirty this			afternoon.	Picard nods. Beverly turns and EXITS. Picard takes	a breath to recenter himself... then brings the flute	to his mouth...					PICARD			Computer -- continue recording.	The MUSIC plays. He begins to play the flute again...	the soft melody...	The door CHIMES. Picard reacts, annoyed.					PICARD			Enter.	WORF ENTERS, stops at the desk.					WORF			Captain, I am sorry to interrupt,			but I wanted to consult you			regarding the duty roster.					PICARD			Proceed.   STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - REV. 9/18/92 - TEASER   5.3    CONTINUED: (5)					WORF			I was hoping we could take			advantage of the Biko's delay by			staging shipwide security drills.			I have planned a tentative			schedule...	Worf hands Picard a PADD. Picard looks it over.					PICARD			Very impressive, Mister Worf.			But we'll be taking on new			personnel at Starbase One-Eighteen			in a few weeks. Surely the drills			can wait until then.	A beat. Worf seems intent on having something to do.					WORF			In that case, I will use the time			to perform maintenance checks on			the forward phaser array.	Picard looks at Worf a moment.					PICARD			Mister Worf... is there some			reason you're trying to give			yourself more work?	Worf hesitates, awkward.					WORF			No sir. I simply wished to use			the extra time to...					PICARD				(cutting in)			... Enjoy yourself. You have some			free time. Use it.	Worf nods.     STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - TEASER     6.3    CONTINUED: (6)					WORF			Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.	Worf turns and EXITS. Picard breathes a sigh of	relief.					PICARD				(to computer)			Computer, once more from the top.	As the MUSIC starts to play...4    INT. WORF'S QUARTERS	Worf ENTERS the room, where ALEXANDER is waiting for	him. Alexander rushes up to him, excited about	something.					ALEXANDER			What did he say?					WORF			The Captain saw fit to release			me from my duties.					ALEXANDER			You mean, you can go?	Worf settles into a nearby chair... resigned... but	he is not happy about what he's about to do...					WORF			I can go.	Alexander reaches offscreen and grabs a nearby COWBOY	HAT. As he places the hat on Worf's head...					ALEXANDER			Saddle up, Father!	OFF Worf's look of resignation...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE     7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            5    EXT. HOLODECK - WESTERN STREET - DAY	A street right out of the OLD WEST. DIRT ROAD, WOODEN	BUILDINGS, TOWNSFOLK, HORSES. There's a SALOON with a	sign out front that reads "The Gold Strike Saloon"...	and there's a SHERIFF'S OFFICE. The street is quiet on	this day... not a lot of activity... just a few	townsfolk mingling about... the wind curling up dust...	CUT TO VARIOUS ANGLES ON THE STREET:6    AN OLD MAN	sitting in a rocking chair on a porch, rocking slowly	back and forth, making a continuous CREAKING sound.	The man puffs on his pipe, hat pulled down over his	eyes to block the sun...7    A HORSE	attached to a hitching post.8thru	OMITTED910   THE OLD MAN	rocking in his chair... creaking... Suddenly he STOPS	rocking. Silence. The man tilts his head upward	slightly to look at the road. Gradually, the SOUND of	FOOTSTEPS can be heard... coming closer...     STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE     8.11   A PAIR OF BOOTS	A large pair of boots on large feet, taking large	steps, spurs jangling, stirring up dust...12   THE HORSE	stomps and whinnies nervously, as if in response...13   THE BOOTS	come to a stop. A second later, more FOOTSTEPS are	heard and a second PAIR OF BOOTS comes into view -- a	very small pair by comparison. Big boot, little boots.14   THE OLD MAN	squinting into the sun to see who is there...15   WIDE ANGLE - WORF AND ALEXANDER	wearing the boots, standing side by side -- lone	figures on the Western street. They are both dressed	in WESTERN ATTIRE, holsters and GUNS at their sides.	They each wear an old-style BADGE on their chest. They	are lawmen.	After a beat, they continue walking... surveying the	town. Alexander is excited to be here. Worf is wary	of the whole venture.					WORF				(to Alexander)			Where are we?					ALEXANDER			Deadwood, South Dakota...			nineteenth century Earth.				(beat)			The Ancient West.	Worf gazes at the surroundings.					WORF			What is our function here?					ALEXANDER			You're the Sheriff... and I'm your			deputy.     STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE     9.15   CONTINUED:					WORF			We are in charge of law			enforcement?					ALEXANDER			Right.	A WOMAN in bawdy apparel walks past -- clearly a "lady	of the night" -- and she throws Worf and Alexander a	come-hither look. Worf reacts -- quickly moves	Alexander away from the woman.					WORF			You wrote this Holodeck program			yourself?					ALEXANDER			Well... Mister Barclay helped a			little.					WORF				(to himself)			I must talk with Mister Barclay...	Suddenly, a GUNSHOT is heard somewhere offscreen. Worf	and Alexander react, then head in the direction of the	shot...16   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around the red giant planet.17   INT. ENGINEERING	Data, Geordi and VARIOUS N.D.s. Data is sitting by an	opened console. A panel on his head is OPEN, revealing	various circuitry within. Fiber-optic cables connect	Data's circuits to the console circuits.	Geordi is making a connection on Data's head. Data	looks at Geordi's face for a second.					DATA			Geordi... I have noticed that you			have not shaved in several days.			Are you attempting to grow another			beard?	Geordi rubs a hand over his face.  STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - REV. 9/17/92 - ACT ONE  9A.17   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			As a matter of fact, I am...				(re: beard)			What do you think?	Data eyes him.					DATA			As is the case with many natural			growth processes, it is difficult			to envision the end product based			on an intermediate stage.	Geordi smiles.					GEORDI			You're right -- give it a few more			days.	Geordi completes the connection on Data's head.					GEORDI			Okay... I'll need to access your			auxiliary inputs...					DATA			One moment.	Data reaches for his head, and REMOVES another panel in	his head, revealing the circuitry underneath.    STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE    10.17   CONTINUED: (2)	Geordi eyes him a moment, then begins to connect a	cable to the circuitry...					GEORDI			I have to admit, Data... I never			get used to seeing you like			this...					DATA			I do not understand. You are			constantly working on similar			electronic systems, yet their			appearances do not disturb you.					GEORDI			Yeah, well... you're not just			another electronic system.	Data thinks this over.					DATA			Thank you, Geordi. Nor are you			just another biological organism.	Geordi smiles, appreciating the sentiment. He	completes the adjustments to Data.					GEORDI			That should do it. Are you ready?					DATA			Yes.				(beat)			I am establishing computer			link-up...	The circuits on Data's head begin to BLINK faster.					DATA			Interface complete.					GEORDI			Alright... let's see what you can			do...	As Geordi works...    STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE    11.18   OMITTED19   INT. GOLD STRIKE SALOON20   CLOSE ANGLE - A WANTED POSTER	attached to a wall in the room. The poster shows a	drawing of a man's face and the words "WANTED: DEAD OR	ALIVE." There is a fresh bullet hole in the forehead	of the man. Two more GUNSHOTS ring out, and we see	two more BULLET HOLES RIP through the drawing of the	man's face...21   REVEAL - ELI HOLLANDER	holding a smoking pistol, having just fired the shot.	Clearly, this is the same man as in the poster. He is	a young, cocky, dangerous gunslinger.					ELI				(re: poster)			If I ever find the varmint who			drew this... he'll be sorry he			ever put pen to paper.				(beat)			I'm ten times uglier than that,			ain't I?	We hear someone LAUGH from offscreen --22   INCLUDE - THE ROOM (OPTICAL)	A smoky barroom occupied by several PEOPLE. A PIANO	PLAYER sits at the piano, picking out a jaunty tune.	The barkeep, a pretty woman named ANNIE MEYERS, stands	behind the bar, glaring at Eli.	Eli's henchman -- a MEXICAN BANDITO, complete with	sombrerro, etc. -- is sitting nearby, laughing.					ELI				(to Bandito)			Shut up.	The Bandito falls silent.					ELI			You laugh so much, it's a wonder			flies don't live in your mouth...	The Bandito laughs at the remark, missing the point.    STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE    12.22   CONTINUED:					BANDITO				(Mexican accent)			You are a very funny man, Senor			Eli...	The bandito stops laughing as he notices Worf and	Alexander ENTER the saloon. Eli follows his gaze, sees	Worf, and his eyes narrow. Everyone in the room turns	and looks. The room falls silent.	Alexander points to Eli, relishing every moment of the	program.					ALEXANDER				(quietly, to Worf)			That's the bad guy. His name's			Eli Hollander -- they call him			"The Butcher of Bozeman." He's			killed twenty-three men.				(beat)			He's the meanest, toughest			gunslinger in the West. You have			to watch him... He's fast...	Worf eyes Eli.					WORF			So I am here to apprehend him?					ALEXANDER			If you can.	Worf nods, now understanding his job -- confident.    STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE    13.22   CONTINUED: (2)	Worf walks across the saloon. Eli walks toward him	too. The jangle of spurs is heard in the silent room.	The onlookers watch nervously. Worf and Eli stop a	couple of feet away from each other... steely-eyed...					WORF				(to Eli)			You are under arrest.	Eli sneers.					ELI			Is that so --	Before Eli can finish, Worf quickly PUNCHES him,	knocking the man cold with one shot. Eli drops to the	floor. The bandito reacts, too shocked to make a move.	Worf bends down and grabs Eli by the collar, lifts him	up.					WORF			You will come with me.	Worf begins to drag Eli out of the saloon. Alexander	looks upset -- this isn't what he had in mind.					ALEXANDER			No, no, no...				(to computer)			Computer -- freeze program.	Everything in the saloon FREEZES.					WORF			What is wrong?					ALEXANDER			That was too easy. It's gotta			be harder to beat the bad guys.			Otherwise, it's no fun.					WORF			Oh.					ALEXANDER				(to computer)			Computer -- increase program			difficulty to Level Four.

Everyone in	the room turns and looks. The room falls silent. The	patrons of the bar suddenly realize they are in the	line of fire -- and they scatter, many of them leaving	the saloon. An open space is left between the two men.	Worf watches the commotion in confusion.					WORF				(to Alexander)			Where are they going?					ALEXANDER				(quietly, to Worf)			They don't want to get hit by the			bullets.	Worf reacts... braces himself, then takes a step toward	Eli.					WORF				(to Eli)			You are under arrest --	Instantly, Eli's hand moves to the butt of his pistol.	Alexander stops Worf.					ALEXANDER				(whispers, urgent)			He's getting ready to draw.	Worf puts his hand to the butt of his own gun. A tense	moment as the two men stare at each other across the	room.	Eli breaks the moment by adopting a wide smile. His	hand hangs down by his gun at all times.					ELI				(to his henchmen)			Well... looks like Sheriff Worf			is here to arrest me. Don't sound			like a very bright idea... does			it?	The bandito shakes his head, stands and opens his coat	to reveal a SHOTGUN.					WORF				(to Eli)			You have been accused of			committing a homicide.    STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE    15A.24   CONTINUED: (2)					ELI			If you mean murder, then I guess			I'm guilty.	Eli slowly walks up to Worf, giving him a hard stare.					ELI				(continuing)			I've killed twenty-three men,			Sheriff... one more ain't gonna			make that much of a difference.    STAR TREK: "A Fistful of Datas" - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE    16.24   CONTINUED: (3)	Worf doesn't flinch. Eli continues to goad Worf.					ELI				(continuing)			'Course... shootin someone as ugly			as you... could hardly be			considered a crime.	The bandito laughs. Worf bristles, angry -- it's all	he can do to hold himself back.					ELI			Were you just born that way...			or did your momma marry an			armadillo?	More laughter. For the briefest instant, Eli's gaze	darts to one side, just behind Worf. Worf sees it,	realizes, and whirls around just in time to get a chair	BROKEN across his back by a SECOND HENCHMAN. (NOTE:	This being a Holodeck act of violence, Worf is	unfazed.) Worf SLUGS the henchman, who goes flying	backward onto the floor.	The bandito moves to grab Worf, but Worf blocks his	arms and lands a punch into his stomach -- then a hard	hook across his face. The bandito goes CRASHING	through a nearby table.	Eli grabs a nearby BOTTLE and breaks it against the	bar -- comes at Worf with the broken shards. Worf	overcomes Eli with a series of well-timed PUNCHES.	Eli falls to the floor, dazed.	Worf looks at Alexander -- he's starting to enjoy	himself.					WORF			I am beginning to see the appeal			of this program...	Alexander grins -- then sees something.					ALEXANDER			Sheriff, look out!	Eli is drawing his pistol.
