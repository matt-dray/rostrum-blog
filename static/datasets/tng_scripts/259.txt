This			telepathic species has no concept			of spoken language, and is being			instructed in its use by... an			old friend.2    INT. TEN FORWARD	The SENIOR STAFF is holding a reception for the Cairn.	They are tallish humanoids, intelligent looking -- with	small protrusions on the sides of their heads that	suggest increased cranial capacity.	PICK UP PICARD and LWAXANA TROI in mid-conversation.	Lwaxana is wearing an outfit that is unusually subdued	for her.					LWAXANA			I don't know what they'd have done			without me. First, I had to learn			how they communicate. It was an			absolutely exhausting process...					PICARD			It must have been.					LWAXANA			Quite different from Betazoid			telepathy. We transmit words...			with the Cairn...				(shakes her head at the				 enormity of it)			... it's images. A flood of them,			all at the same time. It's			overwhelming...         STAR TREK: "Dark Page" - 08/26/93 - TEASER         2.2    CONTINUED:					PICARD			I can imagine...					LWAXANA			It's actually a very efficient way			of communicating. If two Cairn			were having this conversation it			would have been over minutes ago.	This gets Picard's attention.					PICARD			Really?					LWAXANA			But of course they realize they'll			want to communicate verbally if			they join the Federation.				(beat)			Do me a favor... introduce			yourself to one of them and engage			him in conversation -- they need			the practice.					PICARD			I'd be happy to.	He moves off and Lwaxana looks around, spots --2A   GEORDI AND DATA	who are talking with a light-haired Cairn girl of about	eight, HEDRIL.					GEORDI			... it's called a VISOR. It lets			me see things.	When Hedril speaks, her voice has a slight ELECTRONIC	EDGE to it -- as do all the Cairn's voices.       STAR TREK: "Dark Page" - REV. 08/27/93 - TEASER       3.2A   CONTINUED:					HEDRIL			Like my vocal enhancer.				(touches her throat)			It lets me make sounds.	At this point Mrs. Troi swoops down on them.					LWAXANA			I see you've met my star pupil.				(puts her arm around				 Hedril)			Hedril has picked up spoken			language much faster than the			others.					DATA			It is often the case that children			learn languages more easily than			adults.					LWAXANA			Deanna was quite good at languages			when she was little.				(beat)			Where is Deanna?					GEORDI				(looking around)			Should be here someplace...	Mrs. Troi bends down to Hedril.					LWAXANA			Hedril, darling...	She stops, staring at Hedril with a curious expression.	Hedril waits patiently, then --					HEDRIL			What?	Mrs. Troi comes out of her reverie.					LWAXANA			Go find your father, dear. I want			to talk to him.	Hedril darts off and Mrs. Troi puts her face in her	hand for a moment. Data and Geordi are concerned.					DATA			Mrs. Troi, are you all right?         STAR TREK: "Dark Page" - 08/26/93 - TEASER         3A.2A   CONTINUED: (2)	She looks up at them, a little vague.					LWAXANA			Yes... yes... just a little tired.			This constant telepathy with the			Cairn...				(summoning a smile)			I'm fine, really.	She gives them a reassuring smile and moves off toward	Riker and Worf, who are standing alone, chatting.					LWAXANA			Aren't you going to mingle, Mister			Woof?	Worf has given up on correcting her.					WORF			I do not care for telepaths. They			make me... uneasy.					LWAXANA			Don't worry -- The Cairn couldn't			read your thoughts even if they			wanted to. Your brain isn't			sophisticated enough.	Worf reacts and Riker can't help but smile.					LWAXANA				(continuing, to Riker)			Neither is yours, dear. They can			only communicate with other			telepaths.				(beat)			Has either of you seen Deanna?					RIKER				(looking around)			She was working, but she said			she'd be here -- ah -- speak of			the devil.	Troi walks up to them.        STAR TREK: "Dark Page" - 08/26/93 - TEASER        4-5.2A   CONTINUED: (3)					TROI			Sorry I'm late. I lost track of			the time.					LWAXANA			Deanna, dear, come with me. I			want you to meet the senior			diplomat of the Cairn delegation.	She sees Hedril leading a Cairn man, MAQUES, toward	them.					LWAXANA			Maques...				(re Troi)			This is the beautiful daughter			I've been telling you about --			Deanna.         STAR TREK: "Dark Page" - 08/26/93 - TEASER         6.2A   CONTINUED: (4)	Maques smiles... a nice smile, sincere.					MAQUES			Pleased to...	He stops, can't remember the rest of the greeting.	With a self-deprecating smile he decides to try	another, simpler one.					MAQUES			Hello.					TROI			Hello.	Troi helps him out by finishing for him.					TROI				(continuing)			Pleased to meet you.	He smiles.					MAQUES			Yes, that is it. Pleased to meet			you, Deanna.	They share a smile. Lwaxana seems pleased.					LWAXANA			Well, I'll just let you young			people chat...	She moves away with Hedril, Deanna giving her a brief	look. Then, making the most of it...					TROI			Well, Maques... what do you think			of the Enterprise?	There is a brief hesitation as Maques struggles for	words -- still a very difficult concept for him.					MAQUES			It is... --				(he thinks)			-- beautiful... comfortable, also.					TROI			I'm glad you think so.         STAR TREK: "Dark Page" - 08/26/93 - TEASER         7.2A   CONTINUED: (7)					MAQUES			There is another word... a word			that describes it... but... I			cannot remember.	He gives a small shrug, and Troi smiles encouragingly.					TROI			You've learned a great deal in a			very short time. I'm sure it			won't be long before your words			will do justice to your thoughts.	Maques acknowledges, then --					MAQUES			Your Mother has... told me... of			your need.					TROI			Need?	He can't remember the word, holds up a finger to ask	for a moment.					MAQUES			A moment...				(remembers)			Husband. You need a husband.	Troi's face blanches.					MAQUES				(continuing)			I need a wife.	He smiles matter-of-factly.

CORRIDOR	Troi, now in uniform, is heading for her office.					LWAXANA (O.C.)			Deanna!	Troi turns and sees her Mother, waits for her to catch	up.					LWAXANA			Good morning...				(beat)			So what did you think of Maques?					TROI			Why did you do that, Mother? You			embarrassed both of us.					LWAXANA				(dismissing this)			He's really very sweet. And			lonely. Poor man, a widower,			raising a child alone.					TROI			Please, Mother... don't start.	They reach a Turbolift door.					LWAXANA			I just think it's time for you to			settle down. If your Father were			still alive I'm sure he'd say the			same thing.	The door OPENS and they join an N.D Crewperson inside.4    INT. TURBOLIFT	They fall silent in front of the crewperson. After a	moment, Lwaxana continues TELEPATHICALLY.      STAR TREK: "Dark Page" - REV. 08/27/93 - ACT ONE      9.4    CONTINUED:					LWAXANA (V.O.)			But you'll do exactly what you			want...	Troi shoots her a look.					LWAXANA (V.O.)				(continuing)			Just like always...					TROI			Stop it, mother.	The Crewperson reacts to Troi's seemingly out-of-the-blue	statement. Troi realizes and falls silent. After	an awkward moment, the lift stops and the DOOR opens.	Troi EXITS but her mother just stays where she is,	looking despondent.					TROI				(continuing)			Are you coming?	But Lwaxana covers her face with her hands as if to	hide tears. Troi's face registers concern; she takes	her mother by the arm and leads her out of the	turbolift.5    INT. CORRIDOR	The Turbolift door closes and Troi puts a comforting	hand to her mother's shoulder.					TROI			What's wrong... ?	Lwaxana looks at her, her eyes intent with feeling.	Suddenly she clutches Troi to her, hugs her tight.					LWAXANA			You're so precious to me. You're			all I've got. If something			happened to you I don't know what			I'd do...	Troi doesn't know what to make of her mother's abrupt	mood swing, but she does know that right now what she	needs is to be comforted.					TROI			Nothing's going to happen to me...        STAR TREK: "Dark Page" - 08/26/93 - ACT ONE        10.5    CONTINUED:	Troi's comforting words help Lwaxana pull herself	together.					LWAXANA			You'd better go...					TROI			My first appointment isn't for a			few minutes... why don't we talk			for a while?					LWAXANA			I'm fine... I'm just tired from			working with the Cairn and it's			making me emotional.					TROI			Are you sure?					LWAXANA			Go on... I'll see you later...	Troi hesitates. Lwaxana manages a smile.					LWAXANA				(continuing, shooing her				 away)			Go on.	She moves off down the corridor. Troi watches for a	beat, then heads for her office.6    INT.
