Geordi discreetly	indicates a young woman sitting with a friend (it is	CHRISTY, whom we last saw in "Booby Trap" telling	Geordi that she wasn't interested in him "that way").					GEORDI			That's her.	Worf takes a look.					GEORDI			Don't stare.					WORF			Why not?					GEORDI			Because she'll see.					WORF			Good.

He quickly turns toward Worf	and tries to blend into the woodwork, but she ends up	standing right behind him as she waits for her refills.	She recognizes him:					CHRISTY			Hi, Geordi.					GEORDI				(turning around)			Hi, Christy.	A long silence. Christy waits for Geordi to continue,	but Geordi doesn't know what to say. She knows he has	a crush on her and tries to draw him out.					CHRISTY			So... how have you been?					GEORDI			Good.	Another long silence. Christy tries again.					CHRISTY			How are things down in			Engineering?					GEORDI			Fine... uh really... fine.	Another long silence. Christy finally gives up.					CHRISTY			Well, see you around.	Geordi nods and she EXITS.

CORRIDOR	RIKER, BEVERLY, and DATA are moving rapidly down the	corridor towards the Transporter Room. A Turbolift	OPENS and Geordi ENTERS. He quickly falls in step with	the others.					GEORDI			What's this all about, Commander?					RIKER				(to Geordi)			Sensors have discovered a small			one-man ship crashed on the			planet.					BEVERLY			We're picked up life-signs...			humanoid, very faint and fading.	They EXIT into the Transporter Room.4    EXT.

He is	unconscious, in a state of shock. Half his body is	trapped under a mass of bent steel; he has a nasty head	wound. His right arm is severed. Beverly moves	quickly to him and uses her medical tricorder.					GEORDI			We can beam him out from under			there, get him up to Sickbay.					BEVERLY			He's not stable enough for			transport. There's damage to his			brain stem, his autonomic			functions are failing.    STAR TREK: "Transfigurations" - REV. 3/27/90 - TEASER    4.4    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			His heart needs active neural			feedback, it can't regulate			itself. I need a volunteer.					GEORDI			I'm here.					BEVERLY			I'm going to hook your nervous			systems together through my			tricorder -- your brain will			regulate both systems. That			should stabilize him long enough			to get him up to the ship.	The following takes a matter of seconds... she affixes	a neural pad to the base of each of her patient's	skulls. Thin fiber optic cables lead out from these	pads and connect to her tricorder. She flips a switch	and the tricorder starts beeping in synch with Geordi's	heartbeat.					BEVERLY			Take deep, regular breaths. If			anything goes wrong I'll break			the connection.	Geordi nods. She activates the device. Two heartbeats	can now be heard. Suddenly, a strange COLOR WASH moves	along the fiber from the humanoid to Geordi.					BEVERLY				(ready to break				 connection)			Geordi!					GEORDI			I'm fine... no problem.					BEVERLY				(nods and hits combadge)			Transporter Room, three to beam			directly to Sickbay.	As they DEMATERIALIZE, we...									FADE OUT.					END OF TEASER   STAR TREK: "Transfigurations" - REV. 3/30/90 - ACT ONE   5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:5    INT.

BRIDGE	PICARD, Riker, Data, and Worf are on the Bridge.					RIKER			From the size and shape of the			wreckage, it appeared to be some			kind of escape pod. The control			system had been heavily damaged,			that's probably what caused the			crash.					PICARD				(thoughtfully)			An escape pod... then it couldn't			have travelled very far. Mister			Data, any signs of other ships			in this area?					DATA				(works console)			I am picking up a scattering of			debris in extended orbit around			the planet. It reads as refined			metals and other synthetic			compounds.					PICARD			The remains of a larger vessel.			He must have left in the pod			before the ship was destroyed.					WORF				(works console)			Sensors show trace elements in			the debris that would indicate			phaser fire was recently			exchanged.					PICARD			Were you able to salvage anything			from the escape pod?	Data holds up a small gel-filled capsule.					DATA			This is all that is left of the			pod's computer system.					PICARD			Can you access it?    STAR TREK: "Transfigurations" - REV. 4/3/90 - ACT ONE    7.6    CONTINUED:					DATA			It will take time.

There was major trauma to			the head and chest cavity, massive			plasma loss, and severe damage			to most of his organs.					PICARD			What are his chances?					BEVERLY			I believe he'll live... but I'm			afraid I can't take the credit			for it. His body is showing			amazing recuperative powers. The			damaged tissue is repairing itself			at a phenomenal rate.				(beat)			There's only one thing that			troubles me.					PICARD			Go on.					BEVERLY			Take a look at this.	Beverly goes to a wall monitor and taps it. A graphic	display of cells undergoing rapid transformation comes	up.					PICARD			Cell regeneration?					BEVERLY			Yes... the thing is that it has			nothing to do with his injuries.			These are undamaged cells, but			they seem to be mutating.					PICARD			Any theory as to what's causing			it?   STAR TREK: "Transfigurations" - REV. 3/30/90 - ACT ONE   9.8    CONTINUED: (3)					BEVERLY				(shaking head)			No. I've never seen anything like			it.

TEN FORWARD (FORMERLY SCENES 17-20)	Geordi, Worf, and Data are seated at one of the tables.	Geordi and Data are deep in conversation, while Worf	looks a little bored. Geordi is holding the storage	capsule.					GEORDI			I'm telling you Data, there's got			to be some way to decode the			information in this thing.					DATA			I agree Geordi. But the data			matrix within the capsule does			not correspond to any standard			format. All we have been able			to determine is that the device			uses a chemically based system			for molecular energy encoding.					GEORDI			Yeah, and the computer still			can't analyze the specific			chemical elements involved. It's			got to be part of the data			processing system...				(a beat as he thinks)			What if it's a feedback loop			controller?	Data is very interested in this new line of pursuit.					DATA			The compact shape does suggest			a rapid chemical processing and			storage capacity.   STAR TREK: "Transfigurations" - REV. 3/30/90 - ACT ONE   9A.9A   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			We found it close to the escape			pod instrumentation assemblage...			this capsule might process the			ship's dynamic motions and augment			the manual control inputs.				(getting a little				 excited)			We could send it a few test			signals... make it think the			entire assemblage was awake and			operating.					DATA			An intriguing experiment. The			capsule might provide us with			information without the need to			decode the storage medium itself.			Perhaps we could examine your			theory immediately.					WORF				(with usual Klingon				 intensity)			Less talk, more synthehol.				(beat)			We came here to relax.					GEORDI			I am relaxed.

She sees him and gives him a	friendly wave.9B   ON GEORDI	His attitude and demeanor are in marked contrast to	the first scene with Christy in the Teaser. A smile	breaks out on his face and he confidently gets up from	the table and starts to head for the bar.					GEORDI			But you know, Worf you do have			a point.				(to Data)			I think the storage capsule can			wait awhile.	They watch in surprise as he heads for the bar.9C   NEW ANGLE	on Christy and Geordi. Christy has just said good-bye	to her friend and is on her way out when Geordi	smoothly intercepts her.

Meanwhile, Doctor			Crusher reports that the recovery			of the patient she has named John			Doe continues at a remarkable			pace.14   INT. JOHN'S SICKBAY ROOM (OPTICAL)	The room has several devices designed for physical	rehabilitation scattered around it. The circular disc	that hangs over the operating table in Sickbay now	hangs here and dominates the room. There are a few	subtle changes in the disc to suggest small devices and	sensors. John is reclining in a chair beneath the	disc. Small BEAMS OF LIGHT lance down from the disc	and move along John's limbs. Beverly is standing at	a nearby console monitoring the therapy. John's	attitude is bright, positive. He is vibrant and full	of confidence as he goes through his rehabilitation.					BEVERLY			Are you experiencing any			discomfort?					JOHN			None.

I feel strong enough			to fly.	John slowly gets up. He smiles, glad to be on his	feet. He takes a few confident steps and then loses	his balance and collapses on the floor. Beverly moves	over to him quickly. John smiles ruefully.					JOHN			But perhaps I should concentrate			on walking first.	Beverly returns his smile and helps him to his feet.					BEVERLY			Let's try again. But this time...			a little more slowly.					JOHN				(grins)			Much more slowly.	John hesitantly begins to walk, stiff-limbed. Beverly	close at his side. He totters a moment and has to lean	on her for support. John starts to walk again without	her help. As he walks, we can see his strength	starting to return. John begins to flex his arms and	hands... his face shows sheer joy as life returns to	his limbs. Beverly is sharing in his infectious joy.16   NEW ANGLE	As Picard ENTERS. Picard, who has met John before,	realizes that he is witnessing a key moment in John's	recuperation and watches without interrupting. John	begins to walk a little too fast once more and loses	his balance near Picard, who quickly catches him before	he falls. Picard helps John to regain his balance and	then lets him go.					JOHN			I envy your reflexes, Captain.					PICARD			And I envy your strength of will.			Doctor Crusher has kept me			informed of your progress.

I hope			that I'm worthy of her efforts.	Beverly beams as she and John share a moment of pride	over what they've accomplished together. John girds	himself and starts walking again. Beverly monitors him	closely as he slowly moves around the room.					PICARD			Tell me John, are you still unable			to recall anything at all about			your past?	At the mention of his past, John's expression clouds.	His bright and vibrant personality seems dimmed.					JOHN			No... my memories begin the moment			I woke up in Sickbay.				(beat)			Doctor Crusher told me... you			think I was in some kind of			battle.					PICARD			We're quite certain of that.
