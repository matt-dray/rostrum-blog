Although we are due...2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Everyone at his regular station with the exception of	Data whose station is manned by WESLEY.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			... at our next assignment, I have			decided to increase velocity to			warp eight to visit Data's home			planet for a few hours in the			hopes of unraveling some of the			mystery of his beginnings.	GEORDI turns to RIKER.					GEORDI			Sir, we are now twenty minutes			from Omicron Theta...				(checks reading)			... mark!	Riker gets a nod from PICARD, replies to Geordi.					RIKER			Stand by for subwarp; head for			standard orbit of Data's planet.				(to Picard)			Wonder why Data hasn't come up			here.          STAR TREK: "Datalore" - 10/26/87 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:					PICARD			He said he wanted to be alone.			Perhaps it's a bigger moment for			him than we thought.				(turns to Wesley)			If he needs a formal invitation,			Ensign, you do the honors.					WESLEY				(to his feet)			Yes sir!	Wesley heads quickly toward the turbolift.					PICARD			Walk!	Wesley slows to a walk.3    INT. DATA'S QUARTERS	Totally bare except for a quite sophisticated wall	computer and a mirror on a tripod which DATA now stands	in front of watching himself. He SNEEZES. It is not	a good sneeze, comes off rather artificial. Data tries	again, harder... but not much better. Then a CHIME	and Wesley ENTERS.					WESLEY				(excitedly)			Data... !	Data SNEEZES a third time. Wesley stops, puzzled.					WESLEY				(continuing)			What are you doing?					DATA			Sneezing.					WESLEY			Have you got a... a "cold?"					DATA			A cold what?					WESLEY			It's a disease my mother says			people used to get.          STAR TREK: "Datalore" - 10/26/87 - TEASER          3.3    CONTINUED:					DATA				(nods)			Ah. But humans still sneeze for			other reasons and I cannot seem			to do it right.	Another artificial sounding SNEEZE.					WESLEY			How can you be practicing sneezing			when you're arriving for the first			time at your home planet? Aren't			you interested in that?	Without changing tone of voice or expression, Data	heads with Wesley for the door of the cabin.					DATA			More than interested. Fascinated.			One might say agog. But I find			sneezing interesting also.4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	From the Main Viewer WE CAN SEE that the starship is	at subwarp now, and a rather BROWNISH LOOKING PLANET	IS COMING INTO VIEW in the distance.					TASHA				(checking readings)			Confirming Class M reading there.			But...				(checks readings)			... but the sensors aren't showing			any life readings. Not even			vegetation.					PICARD			Strange. The cruiser that found			Data reported farmland here.	Data and Wesley EMERGE from the turbolift, CROSS ONTO	the bridge. Riker turns to Data, indicates Helm.					RIKER			Want to take her into orbit, Data?					DATA			No thank you, sir.       STAR TREK: "Datalore" - REV. 10/27/87 - TEASER       4.4    CONTINUED:	Riker, surprised, indicates for Wesley to fill Data's	Helm position again. Data instead, walks forward and	examines the PLANET COMING CLOSER, more than filling	the Main Viewer screen. All eyes are on Data as he	examines his home planet on the viewer, then turns and	moves back to take a seat in the Command Area.					PICARD			Continue on into close parking			orbit.					GEORDI			Aye, sir.					DATA				(beat; to Picard)			I could say "home, sweet home,"			sir... if I understood how the			word sweet applies.					PICARD			It usually refers to the memories.					RIKER			But usually one's own memories,			Captain.				(to Data)			Do the memories you were given			include "farms?"					DATA			Affirmative, sir. Turning soil,			seeding, harvesting... but the			colony's principal interest was			science.					TASHA			Data, I can't understand how you			can hold the memories of four			hundred eleven people. If that			means every experience, every day			they lived...					DATA			It does not, unfortunately. It			means only the knowledge they had			accumulated. Actually, I am quite			deficient in some basic human			information.				(to Picard)			Sneezing, for example.       STAR TREK: "Datalore" - REV. 10/27/87 - TEASER       5.4    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			"Sneezing?"					GEORDI			Approaching close parking orbit,			sir.					PICARD				(to Riker)			Assemble your away party,			Commander.	Riker stands; Picard smiles at Data.					PICARD				(continuing)			This is an exciting moment for			you, Data. I'm tempted to lead			the away team down myself, except			for the fact the first officer			would object...					RIKER			How would Starfleet judge me if			I didn't, sir? An entire Earth			colony did disappear down there.	As Riker stands, replacements are ENTERING to take over	the bridge positions of Geordi, Worf and Tasha who will	move to the turbolift with him.					WORF				(to Data)			You have no memory at all of what			happened to them, Data?          STAR TREK: "Datalore" - 10/26/87 - TEASER          6.4    CONTINUED: (3)					DATA			My final memory is of great			danger, something sudden and not			understood... then a blank as if			the colonists were gone.					GEORDI			Now in close parking orbit, sir.					PICARD			Welcome home, Mister Data.	Data looks puzzled at this. Then he joins the away	team which EXITS the bridge.									FADE OUT:                         END OF TEASER                                 STAR TREK: "Datalore" - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE       7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:5    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)	The starship in close orbit of Data's home planet.6    EXT. DATA'S PLANET (OPTICAL)	The Away Team of Riker, Data, GEORDI, TASHA and WORF	MATERIALIZING on the planet surface. Far from it	looking like farmland, the place is barren. They	stand for a moment looking around -- Worf is alert to	any security problems -- Tasha scans with her tricorder	-- Riker is carefully looking over their surroundings	-- Geordi kneels, inspecting the ground.					TASHA				(to Riker)			Recording signal now locked onto			the Enterprise, sir.					RIKER				(to Geordi)			This looks like anything but			farmland.					GEORDI			Agreed, sir. The soil here's			completely lifeless.					RIKER			This is the exact position listed			in the Tripoli log.				(turning			Do you recognize anything, Data?					DATA			The land contours are familiar,			sir. Topographically, this is			the correct area.	Interrupted by Geordi who has begun crumbling soil	close to his nose, examining it as he lets the	fragments fall from his hand.       STAR TREK: "Datalore" - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE       8.6    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			This once was rich farmland. I'd			guess something like twenty to			thirty years ago...					DATA			I was discovered twenty-six years			ago...					GEORDI				(still sifting soil)			There is still plant cellulose			in the soil. No signs of decay.			Also no signs of bacteria either.				(looks up)			If you don't mind a wild guess,			sir, I'd say everything on this			planet could have been dead or			dying at the time Data was found.					RIKER			The Tripoli log stated that all			plant life appeared brown and			"dormant." They assumed it was			normal for that season.					GEORDI			... whereas actually everything			was dying...					DATA				(interrupting;				 indicating)			I was found twenty meters in that			direction, sir.	Data begins leading the way toward a narrow ledge	leading down into a depression.7    ANOTHER ANGLE	as all follow Data's lead.					TASHA				(moving alongside Data)			Data, any idea at all why you were			given the colonists' memories?					DATA			I have always felt that it was			done hurriedly, but I know little			more.         STAR TREK: "Datalore" - 10/26/87 - ACT ONE         9.7    CONTINUED:	Data stops where a small rectangular depression has	been carved in the rock.					DATA				(continuing)			Here, sir. This is where the			cruiser's landing party found			the signal device that had led			them here.				(indicates)			And they found me lying there,			sir.8    ANOTHER ANGLE	Data is leading them to a very undistinguished-looking	stone pallet. This and the barren location look to	be considerably less than the exciting mystery they	have expected.					TASHA			You were just lying out in the			open? No identity record, no			instructions... ?					DATA			Only a layer of dust.	Data bends, BLOWS, and a CLOUD OF DUST ARISES from the	pallet.					DATA				(continuing)			There's much more of it now, after			twenty-six years.	Only Geordi shows active interest in this place. He	has moved off to begin scanning the area from different	perspectives.					RIKER			What is the first thing you			remember, Data?					DATA			Opening my eyes and finding myself			looking into the eyes of the			Tripoli landing party, sir.					(MORE)      STAR TREK: "Datalore" - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE      10.8    CONTINUED:					DATA (Cont'd)				(indicating the path				 back)			They believed that the signal			device sensed their presence,			and activated me.					TASHA			Then this very spot was your			birthplace...					DATA			But not at all like a human birth.			Having the colonists' memories,			I knew immediately how to speak,			who I was, where I was...					TASHA			You were born and became fully			knowledgeable at the same instant!					DATA			I had no idea that was unusual,			of course.					TASHA			It's such a strange place to be			born.					RIKER			So was a manger.					WORF			A "manger," sir?					RIKER			I won't even try to explain that			one, Worf...					GEORDI				(calling)			I understand now, sir! I've got			this figured!	Geordi moves in, indicating aspects of the area.					GEORDI				(continuing)			It was really very cleverly done			to make this look like a natural			hollow in the terrain here.			Signs of it being constructed			hurriedly...      STAR TREK: "Datalore" - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE      11.9    SPECIAL EFFECTS ANGLE	Geordi moves to the rock face behind Data's "birth	pallet," examining it very closely.					GEORDI			... as if to hide something here.	Data nods, seeming to understand more of this now.					DATA			Yes, that was it, Geordi.				(to Riker)			This has awakened a memory			remnant of how the colonists			hoped to remain hidden...				(beat; concentrating)			... but their fear of being			discovered led to their storing			information in me.	Geordi has brought his VISOR device within inches of	a point on the rock facing.					GEORDI			Yes, I thought so.	Geordi brings a finger carefully to an almost invisble	crack on the rock facing... presses! A HUMMING SOUND	and a SPECIAL EFFECT opening in the rock facing	APPEARS.10   INT. UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - ANGLE INTO THE ENTRY	A curving tunnel. Geordi steps in closer, Riker and	Data pressing in next. Geordi reaches out, touching	something that suddenly ILLUMINATES the tunnel.	Tasha, duty always, steps forward and scans the tunnel.	Then to Riker:					TASHA			No life readings in here either,			sir.	Riker leads the way as the team cautiously heads into	the tunnel. Worf and Tasha flank him, weapons ready,	as they move into a rectangular corridor.11   ANOTHER ANGLE	as they continue to an intersecting corridor which	features a familiar-looking type of sliding metal door.	Geordi again makes a close examination of this, then	touches a sensor switch. The sliding door OPENS.      STAR TREK: "Datalore" - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE      12.12   INT. COLONY LABORATORY	Similar to some very sophisticated things we've seen	on the Enterprise, the lab is filled with equipment	and instruments of the most sophisticated twenty-fourth century	level. In addition to workbenches, etc. there is a	prominent covered worktable which will figure in scenes	here. The team ENTERS with Tasha at the lead, weapon	in hand -- and with Worf professionally guarding their	rear at the door to the corridor they entered from.	Riker scans the lab.					RIKER			The colony laboratory, I'd guess.			Extremely well equipped.				(to Data)			Does this place stir any memories,			Data?					DATA			Only vague impressions of some			of my functions being tested			here, sir...	Data indicates, moves toward a wall on which proud	scientist parents had posted their children's drawings.	Several of them PICTURE a crystal-like formation or	design, obviously huge judging from the very tiny	people who seem to be fleeing from it. Data pulls one	of these drawings free, hands it to Riker.					RIKER			Posted by a proud parent...					DATA				(continuing)			This pictures something that feels			familiar, sir. And dangerous,			although I have no idea what it			represents. And that is all...	Then Data indicates a desk/workbench combination which	includes highly sophisticated-looking devices.					DATA				(continuing)			... except for an impression that			this was a... "Doctor Soong's"			work area.					RIKER			Who? You can't mean Doctor			Noonien Soong?      STAR TREK: "Datalore" - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE      13.12   CONTINUED:					DATA				(nods)			He was called that here...			although, his memories indicate			he traveled here under a different			name.					GEORDI			Doctor Noonien Soong, my friend,			just happens to have been Earth's			foremost robotics scientist!					TASHA			Until he tried to make Asimov's			dream of a positronic brain come			true.					RIKER				(nodding)			The positronic brain. He promised			it would do so much. When it			failed completely, Doctor Soong			disappeared.				(eyes Data)			Now we know he went off somewhere			to try a second time.				(turns; indicating)			Geordi, Data, we'll take a close			look at this lab.				(to Tasha)			You and Lieutenant Worf			reconnoiter where the rest of			these corridors lead.	Tasha and Worf EXIT, AD LIBBING "Aye, sir." Geordi	and Data choose areas to inspect while Riker	concentrates on the Soong workbench.13   ANOTHER ANGLE	Riker moves to the large, thick laboratory table	mentioned earlier. Whatever they've found out about	it has lead Riker now to touch a control on it -- and	it now hinges apart HUMMING and presenting the torso	and head part of a human-shaped mold. Seeing what is	happening, Geordi and Data hurry over.					GEORDI				(beat)			Data... it's you.         STAR TREK: "Datalore" - 10/26/87 - ACT ONE         14.13   CONTINUED:	Data hesitates, then reaches in and extracts a one-half	head and shoulders portion of the mold, presses it	against himself. It fits perfectly!					RIKER			An epidermal mold, I'd guess.			Made to give your exterior the			desired finish.					TASHA'S COM VOICE			Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker.	Riker touches his insignia.					RIKER			Come in, Lieutenant.					TASHA'S COM VOICE			Sir... this installation is big			enough to hold hundreds of people.			But all that's here now is empty			beds.					RIKER			Thank you, Lieutenant. Complete			your record scans, then report			back here.					GEORDI			Sir...				(bends)			Seems to be a storage area here...	Geordi has indeed discovered a storage area which he	now opens. All three of them look, REACT.14   ANGLE INCLUDING STORAGE AREA	which REVEALS enough Data-like arms, torso and head	to startle us. It also startles our away team members.	The head looks surprisingly lifelike! (There are more	Data-like parts further back in the storage area,	apparontly enough to make up a whole Data if put	together.)15   ANGLE ON DATA, RIKER, AND GEORDI	stunned.      STAR TREK: "Datalore" - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT ONE      15.15   CONTINUED:					RIKER			How many more Datas are there?					GEORDI				(looking around)			Looks like just these two...				(quickly apologetic)			I mean that and the real Data.16   PANNING THE REAL DATA	and REVEALING the "DATA" HEAD as he bends to examine	"himself."17   INCLUDING RIKER AND GEORDI	as Data straightens up INTO THE SCENE with them.					DATA			Commander, can this be another			me? Or perhaps my brother?					RIKER			I honestly don't know, Data.					DATA			He needs assembling.					RIKER			"He?" Data, we don't know that			this could become "alive."					DATA			It is of great interest to me to			find out, sir. I never believed it			possible I might have a link with			some form like my own.					RIKER				(beat; nods)			Understood. We'll take it back			to the ship, of course.									FADE OUT:                        END OF ACT ONE                                   STAR TREK: "Datalore" - 10/26/87 - ACT TWO         16.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:18   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE	Picard, Riker, Geordi, Tasha, Worf and Wesley at their	regular positions. Tasha is receiving a subspace	message, turns now toward Picard.					TASHA			Captain, I have a subspace reply			to your request.				(turns to Picard)			Starfleet considers it vital we			begin our ship's computer upgrade			at Starbase Armus Nine on			schedule.					PICARD				(annoyed)			Damn. Can anyone see why they've			turned down a perfectly legitimate			request to finish this			investigation here?					WESLEY				(waits; then)			Sir... you asked for the kind of			computer upgrade that only the			Bynars can handle. And they're			available only at this time.	Picard is at first annoyed at Wesley, then turns to	Riker, snapping an order:					PICARD			Then, get us there on schedule,			Number One.				(to Wesley; controlling				 self)			Thank you, Wesley. I'd completely			forgotten that.	Wesley starts to say something more, but Riker quiets	Wesley with a friendly warning gesture.					RIKER			Take us out of orbit, Mister La			Forge.         STAR TREK: "Datalore" - 10/26/87 - ACT TWO         17.19   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	We hold on our starship long enough to see it LEAVING	orbit of Data's home planet.					PICARD (V. O.)				(continuing)			Captain's log, Stardate 41242.45.			Despite having only a few hours			in which to explore Data's home			planet...20   INT. SICKBAY	Where Doctor Crusher and CHIEF ENGINEER ARGYLE work	with Medical and Engineering Specialists at an advanced	type operating table containing the various parts of	the unassembled android which was discovered.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			... we have discovered something			which may explain Data's			beginnings... if we can properly			assemble and communicate with what			we've found.21   ANGLE EMPHASIZING DATA	An expression of hope and longing on his face as he	watches the medical and engineering people at work on	the unassembled android.	Doctor Beverly Crusher MOVES INTO SHOT with Data. She	understands what the unassembled android means to him	and her sympathy is obvious.					BEVERLY			Signal from the captain. They			need you at the debriefing.	Data nods as Chief Engineer Argyle MOVES INTO SHOT also,	his sympathy obvious too.					DATA			I've been anxious to hear the			chief engineer's opinion, Mister			Argyle. Do you believe he can			be made to function?         STAR TREK: "Datalore" - 10/26/87 - ACT TWO         18.21   CONTINUED:					ARGYLE			It appears to include all the			components in your body. Not that			we really understand your			construction either...					BEVERLY			We'll have our top medical and			engineering specialists working			on its assembly, Mister Data.	The Doctor and Engineer appear to hesitate over	something uncomfortable. Data nods at their previous	statement, moves as if to leave.					ARGYLE			Just... one thing. Without			disassembling you, of course, if			we should need...					BEVERLY			... If we should need to compare			this with the way... uh, with the			way you're put together... ?	Data nods his answer, turns and EXITS.22   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)	Outside, the passing stars reflect the fact our	starship is at warp speed to make up for the delay at	Data's planet. On the table, the child's drawing of a	strange crystalline shape.	Present are Picard, Riker, and Geordi. As before,	they will continue treating Data as a living person	but at times they may try a bit too hard to make that	feeling clear. For some, their first meeting with Data	was many years ago and they have long thought of him	simply as a fellow crewmember. Now, with the discovery	of the disassembled android form, they've been suddenly	reminded that their friend is also a machine. It	brings their emotions into play because they're	concerned for Data. How does he feel about this	remarkable happening? What should they say to him --	what words should they now use or not use? Meanwhile,	Picard is speaking to Riker:         STAR TREK: "Datalore" - 10/26/87 - ACT TWO         19.22   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Bringing it up here was the right			thing to do, of course, Number			One.	Picard trails his words as Data ENTERS and seats	himself. Despite themselves, everyone stiffens a bit.					PICARD				(continuing)			I was just saying, Data, that if			it functions, it might answer a			lot of questions for us.	Data feels the tension too.

We			know that you're as "alive" as			any of the rest of us.				(to the others)			If you find it awkward to be			reminded that Data is a			"machine"... you might remember			that the rest of you are merely			a different variety of			machine... in our case,			electro-chemical in nature.					(MORE)      STAR TREK: "Datalore" - REV. 10/27/87 - ACT TWO      20.22   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD (Cont'd)				(sits)			Let's begin handling this as we			would anything else.	A grin has come over Riker's face during this and he	TAPS his knuckles on the table approvingly.

Love that captain!					PICARD				(snaps)			My comments, Lieutenant, do not			require applause!					GEORDI			Yes, sir; sorry, sir.	But as the captain now turns toward the others, Riker	flashes Data a big wink. Data looks puzzled.					PICARD			Let's start with you, Data.					DATA			Well... a good starting point might			be, "Why was I given human form?"					GEORDI			To make it easy for humans to			relate to you.

Then another control which	causes it to BATHE THE FACIAL "TIC" AREA WITH	ELECTRONIC DISCHARGES WHICH APPEAR AS MINIATURE	"LIGHTNING BOLTS." He keeps at this "treatment" until	that part of his face BEGINS TO GLOW. Then he lowers	the device and as the GLOW FADES, then works his facial	muscles, testing them.54   EXT.
