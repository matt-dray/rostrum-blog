SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship is entering orbit around a planet.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 45376.3.			We are approaching the planet			Bilana Three, where a new method			of propulsion known as the Soliton			Wave is being developed. The			Enterprise has been asked to			participate in one of the first			tests of this new technology.2    INT. MAIN ENGINEERING	GEORDI is working at a monitor in his office. He	crosses to the pool table, where WORF and DATA are	working. Geordi is very up, very excited. Data and	Worf are their usual stoic selves.					GEORDI				(to Data)			We're going to witness a moment			in history, Data.					DATA				(puzzled)			Every nanosecond in this			continuum becomes a moment in			history once it has elapsed.					GEORDI			No, no. I mean we're going to			see something that people will			talk about for years.	Data nods in understanding and then returns to work.	Geordi turns to Worf, determined to impress upon him	the importance of what they're doing.         STAR TREK: "New Ground" - 10/4/91 - TEASER         2.2    CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(to Worf)			Think about it... no more bulky			warp engines or nacelles... a			ship just generates a Soliton			Wave... and then rides it through			space like a surfboard.	Worf makes a noncommittal grunt of acknowledgement.	Geordi makes one last attempt.					GEORDI			This is going to be like being			there to watch Chuck Yeager break			the sound barrier, or Zephram			Cochrane engage the first warp			drive!	Worf and Data look at Geordi for a beat.					DATA			It should be interesting.					WORF				(flat)			Very exciting.	Geordi looks at them helplessly. Nothing is going to	excite these two.					GEORDI			I'm talking to the wrong crowd.				(sees another crewman				 and walks away)			Donaldson! Hey, Donaldson, can			you believe that we're actually			going to be there when they...	As Geordi moves to talk with Donaldson...					VOICE			Lieutenant Worf, you have a			subspace communication from the			transport ship Milan.3    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As Worf moves to a monitor and touches a button.       STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - TEASER       3.3    CONTINUED:					WORF				(to com)			Transfer the signal to this			station.	The image of HELENA ROZHENKO fills the screen.					HELENA				(smiles warmly)			Hello, Worf.	Worf is surprised, but pleased to see his mother.					WORF			Mother?					HELENA			I hope you don't mind us dropping			in on you like this, but when I			heard the Enterprise was going			to be in this sector, we took the			first transport... and here we			are.					WORF			Is father with you?	A brief beat of discomfort crosses Helena's face, but	she covers it quickly and tries to sound happy and	normal.					HELENA			No. I brought Alexander with me.			I thought the two of you might			like a chance to... visit.	Worf knows there's something going on here... he is	quiet for a moment, but doesn't want to press his	mother just now.					WORF			Very well. I will make			arrangements for you to come			aboard.					HELENA				(pleased)			Good.									CUT TO:         STAR TREK: "New Ground" - 10/4/91 - TEASER         4.4    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	A TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN is behind the console. Worf	is waiting by the platform. Helena and ALEXANDER	MATERIALIZE on the platform. Helena gives Worf a big	hug.					HELENA			It's good to see you, Worf.				(beat)			You look wonderful. Is that			a touch of gray in your beard?	Worf instinctively puts a hand to his chin.					HELENA				(proudly)			Don't worry, the Rozhenko men have			always had beards of iron-gray.	Alexander has stayed behind on the transporter platform	and now Helena and Worf both turn their attention to	him. Alexander is simply staring at Worf... a little	scared and a little curious. Worf is happy to see his	son again.					WORF				(warm)			Hello, Alexander.					ALEXANDER			Hello.	Worf extends a hand and Alexander shakes it after a	beat.					WORF			It is good to see you both. How			long can you stay?	That's not a question Helena wanted to answer right	now, but Alexander speaks right up as if the answer	should be obvious.         STAR TREK: "New Ground" - 10/4/91 - TEASER         5.4    CONTINUED:					ALEXANDER			I'm not going back.	Worf looks to Helena, who looks guilty.

TEN FORWARD	Worf and Helena ENTER. They head for a private table	near one of the windows.					HELENA			Did you see Alexander's face when			he saw the play area? He's going			to love it here.	That brings up a subject Worf would like to talk about.	They sit.					WORF			Mother, why does Alexander believe			he is remaining... ?	Worf trails off as a WAITER comes over to the table to	take their order.					HELENA				(to waiter)			Lapsang suchong tea, please.	The waiter looks at Worf, but he shakes his head no.					HELENA			Have you been eating? You look			thin.					WORF			Mother...					HELENA			When your father was in Starfleet,			I always had to make sure that---					WORF				(gentle but firm)			Mother. We need to talk about			Alexander.	Helena knows he's right. She reluctantly nods her head	as the Waiter returns and gives her the tea. Helena	sips some of the tea and pauses for a moment. She has	some difficult things to say to Worf and it's not going	to be easy for her. Worf waits respectfully for his	mother to lead the conversation.        STAR TREK: "New Ground" - 10/4/91 - ACT ONE        6A.5    CONTINUED:					HELENA			Alexander's a fine boy, Worf.			Smart... high-spirited... a lot			like you at that age.				(smiles)			In fact, sometimes he comes			running through the house and			knocks over that big green lamp,			just like you used to do.					WORF			I don't recall you smiling when			I knocked over that lamp.      STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE      7.5    CONTINUED: (2)					HELENA			Well... maybe once when you			weren't looking.				(beat)			When we learned that Alexander			was coming to live with us, we			were very happy. The house had			been... empty since you left.			We thought, here is our chance			to fill it with the sounds of			children again.	Helena pauses. She looks at Worf and her tone becomes	more confidential...					HELENA			But... the truth is... your father			and I are getting old, Worf.					WORF				(protesting)			Mother, you both still have many			years---					HELENA				(smiles)			I don't mean we're ready for the			grave... not yet, anyway.				(beat)			But we are a little... less			active. It's hard for us to keep			up with Alexander. We're ready			to be... just grandparents.				(beat)			Alexander needs to be with his			father.	Worf's tone is regretful, but firm.					WORF			That is not possible. We will			have to find another option.	Helena considers Worf for a moment. She had hoped it	wouldn't be necessary to get into this, but Worf isn't	responding yet.      STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE      8.5    CONTINUED: (3)					HELENA			He needs his father, Worf.			Alexander's having...			difficulties.					WORF			Difficulties?	This is hard for Helena, they're talking about her	grandson, after all. But these things must be said.					HELENA			He is... disobedient.	Worf's natural instinct is to rise to his son's	defense.					WORF			Klingon children are often...			difficult to control...					HELENA				(wry)			I do know something about how			Klingon children behave.	Worf looks immediately abashed.					HELENA			But it's more than his willful			attitude. He... does not always			tell the truth.					WORF				(shocked)			My son is... a liar?					HELENA				(firm)			He is a boy. And boys can			sometimes take the wrong path.			They must have guidance.				(beat)			Alexander needs a father -- his			father to give him that guidance.	Worf is too shocked by this revelation about Alexander	to argue any further. Helena considers Worf for a few	moments then reluctantly ends the discussion.					HELENA			I have to go. The transport will			be returning to Earth shortly.         STAR TREK: "New Ground" - 10/4/91 - ACT ONE         9.5    CONTINUED: (4)	Helena puts her arm around Worf.					HELENA			Do what you believe is best for			him, Worf. That's all that any			parent can hope to do.	A moment between mother and son. Worf still isn't sure	what to do... but he accepts his mother's words. As	they rise and head for the exit...									CUT TO:6    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	In orbit around Bilana Three.6A   INT. CORRIDOR	As they walk down the corridor, Worf tries to talk to	Alexander in the easy, casual way he imagines other	fathers do with their sons. Alexander's responses are	not very engaging.					WORF			Did you enjoy going to school on			Earth?					ALEXANDER			Yes.	Beat.					WORF			Did you like your teachers?      STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/8/91 - ACT ONE      10.6A   CONTINUED:					ALEXANDER			Yes.	Beat.					WORF			Good.	Another beat of silence as Worf searches for another	topic.					WORF			I understand that you lived in			my old room.					ALEXANDER			Uh-huh.	Beat.					WORF			Good.	An awkward silence follows as Worf discovers that they	don't have much to say to one another. They continue	to walk for a few beats... Worf is grateful when they	finally come to the door of the teacher's office. He	presses the panel outside the door.6B   INT. TEACHER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS	A small, comfortable office decorated with children's	drawings, toys, and games. The door CHIMES and MS.	KYLE looks up from her desk. She is a caring and warm	woman, yet her voice carries a ring of authority that	unruly children would be unwise to challenge.					KYLE			Come in.	Worf and Alexander ENTER. Kyle stands and smiles.	She moves to them and tries to immediately make them	both comfortable.					KYLE			Lieutenant Worf, it's good to see			you again.					(MORE)      STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/8/91 - ACT ONE      11.6B   CONTINUED:					KYLE (cont'd)				(to Alexander)			And you must be Alexander. I hear			you'll be coming to school with			us for a while?	Alexander isn't responding to Kyle's friendly	attitude. He simply nods in response to her question	and his attention wanders around the room.					KYLE				(to Alexander)			Well, we're very excited to have			you with us... I know the other			boys and girls will be happy to			have a new classmate.	No response from Alexander. Kyle isn't fazed by his	attitude and she moves back to her desk as Worf and	Alexander sit in two nearby chairs. Kyle begins to	work the terminal on the desk.					KYLE			First, I need to get a little			information from you. Let's start			with...				(pretends to think)			... your name.				(works terminal)			Alexander Rozhenko... hmmmm...			that's a tough one... maybe you			can help me. Can you spell your			last name for me?	Alexander gives no indication that he's even heard the	question.					WORF				(prompting)			Alexander...	Alexander looks up.					WORF				(firmer)			The teacher asked you a question.	Kyle doesn't want to spark a confrontation and she	easily dismisses the issue.      STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE      12.6B   CONTINUED: (2)					KYLE			It doesn't matter. I think I can			figure it out.				(works terminal, then				 to Worf)			Date of birth?	Worf thinks for a beat... but he doesn't know the	answer. Alexander and the teacher both look at him...	there is a very awkward and embarassing moment as	everyone finally realizes that Worf doesn't even know	his own son's birthday. Alexander finally supplies	the information.					ALEXANDER				(hurt, to Worf)			The forty-third day of Maktag,			stardate 43205.					WORF			Yes... of course.					KYLE				(quickly moving on)			I'll get the rest of his personal			records from the school on Earth.			One last question... how long will			he be staying aboard ship?	Another uncomfortable question for Worf. This time	he's the only one who can supply the answer. Alexander	looks at his father in surprise... he thought he was	staying. After a long beat...					WORF			It has... not been decided.	Hold on the hurt look on Alexander's face and Worf's	reaction...6C   INT. READY ROOM	Picard is sitting at his desk looking over a PADD in	mild irritation. He sets it down... looks at the	door... nothing happens... he picks up the PADD again.	Finally the door CHIMES.					PICARD			Come.     STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE     12A.6C   CONTINUED:	A somewhat harried Worf ENTERS. Picard fixes him with	a withering look.					PICARD			I thought our meeting was at			eleven hundred hours, Mister Worf.					WORF			I apologize for being late,			Captain. I was detained in...			school.				(off Picard's look)			I was enrolling my... son in			class.					PICARD			I see.				(beat, then back to				 business)			Several officers will be			transferring aboard next week			and I'd like to discuss making			a few personnel changes---					KYLE'S COM VOICE			Kyle to Lieutenant Worf.	Worf is very uncomfortable. Picard's face is carefully	neutral.					WORF				(to Com)			Worf here.					KYLE'S COM VOICE			I'm sorry to bother you again,			Lieutenant, but I forgot to			mention that we need to arrange			for a series of placement			examinations for Alexander. If			you could tell me when---					WORF				(curt)			This is not a good time. I will			contact you shortly, Ms. Kyle.			Worf out.				(beat)			Sorry, Captain.	Picard gives no reaction and smoothly picks up where	he left off.     STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE     12B.6C   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Personnel changes. I'd like you			to consider transferring Ensign			Rocha to phaser control and			promoting Lieutenant---					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE			Sickbay to Worf.	Worf is really embarassed... Picard's silence speaks	volumes.					WORF				(to com)			Yes, Doctor?					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE			I need to schedule a physical			examination for Alexander. I			also need his complete medical			records from Earth and---					WORF			Doctor, I would rather discuss			this at a later time.					PICARD				(holds up a hand)			Mister Worf.				(gently, with a hint				 of humor)			You are not the first officer on			this ship to have a new family			member. Take care of your son.			The personnel changes can wait.	Worf is still a little embarassed, but he's grateful	for the reprieve.					WORF				(stands)			Thank you, sir.	Worf EXITS. Picard watches him leave and then smiles	to himself for a moment.6D   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship is still in orbit.     STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE     12C.7    OMITTED7A   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)	PICARD, RIKER, Geordi, Data, and Worf are listening	to DOCTOR JA'DAR. Dr. Ja'Dar is a middle-aged,	humanoid alien who appears totally consumed by his	work. Ja'Dar is pointing to the wall monitor upon	which is a diagram of a SPACECRAFT in orbit around a	PLANET.      STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE      13.7A   CONTINUED:					JA'DAR			Twenty-three field coils, working			in concert, will generate the			soliton wave from this point on			the planet surface.	Ja'Dar presses a button on the console.8    ON MONITOR (OPTICAL)	The SOLITON WAVE rises up from the planet and heads	for the spacecraft. (The wave is represented by three	small arcs tightly moving in a straight line.)					JA'DAR (o.c.)				(over above action)			We will have the test ship towed			to a position approximately two			million kilometers from Bilana			Three.	The waves HIT the ship and the ship starts MOVING along	with the waves.9    RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)					JA'DAR			If our theories are correct, the			wave will envelop the ship and			push it into warp.					PICARD				(impressed)			Warp without warp drive...					RIKER				(with humor)			They're going to put you out of			a job, Geordi.					GEORDI				(grins)			I hope so, sir.					DATA				(to Ja'Dar)			Doctor Ja'Dar, how closely will			the Enterprise need to follow the			test vehicle?      STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE      14.9    CONTINUED:					JA'DAR			The soliton emits a great deal			of subspace radio interference.			You'll need to be within twenty			kilometers in order to receive			telemetry.					PICARD			How will you end the experiment?					JA'DAR			The wave will be directed toward			Lemma Two, about three light years			distance. We have a sister			facility there which will			generate a scattering field to			dissipate the wave, and bring the			ship out of warp.	Ja'Dar turns OFF the monitor and turns back to them.					JA'DAR			I'll have more detailed			operational plans sent to you			within the hour.	Everyone seems comfortable with the mission.      STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE      15.9    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Very well, Doctor.

He feels uncomfortable	talking about this on the bridge. Troi moves up the	ramp to stand next to him.					WORF			Yes.					TROI			I'm sure he'll do well. She's			a wonderful teacher.					WORF			Good.					TROI			Did she tell you about the			father/son field trip this			afternoon?					WORF			Yes. We cannot attend.					TROI			Why not?					WORF			I have a personnel review			scheduled at thirteen hundred			hours.	Troi looks at him for a beat.

BOYS (roughly the same age as	Alexander) with their N.D. FATHERS are listening to	Ms. Kyle. She is holding a small MODEL of a	rhinoceros, and there are several TABLES with other	models of animals and plants in the b.g., including	replicas of a few Earth animals.					KYLE			... as the value of their horns			increased, the number of white			Rhinos in the wild kept falling			until they finally became extinct			about two centuries ago.	She puts the model of the animal back on the table and	begins to move to another part of the lab. The group	moves to follow her.12   NEW ANGLE	As the group moves with Kyle, we find Worf and	Alexander bringing up the rear of the group.					KYLE				(over following action)			Now I want to show you a pair of			animals we're trying to save from			extinction. They're from Corvan			Two, where their homes in the			rainforests are being threatened			by industrial pollutants.	Worf is listening intently to the teacher, as if he	were going to be tested on this stuff. Alexander's	attention keeps wandering... he's bored. They have	all arrived at the large cargo container which has a	large WINDOW dominating one side of the container.					KYLE				(continuing)			They're called Corvan Gilvos.	She touches a panel and a LIGHT COMES ON inside the	container.         STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE      18.13   ON CONTAINER	There is a medium-sized tree with thick limbs and	branches surrounded by rocks and a few short bushes	inside the container, but there doesn't appear to be	anything else. The children all gather at the	window... even Alexander appears a little curious...	but there still doesn't seem to be anything in the	container. Kyle smiles and taps the glass.					KYLE			They're a little shy.14   ON TREE	In response to the tapping on the glass, an EYE	suddenly opens on one of the "branches" of the tree.	The GILVO'S body looks like a long skinny piece of bark,	and until it starts to move along the tree, it is	virtually undetectable to the naked eye.15   RESUME SCENE	The children are delighted and they press closer to the	glass as ANOTHER GILVO starts to MOVE.	Alexander is enthralled by this creature, and he moves	right up to the glass and stares at it.					KYLE			The eating habits of Gilvos are			very similar to those of Earth's			Draco lizards, which died out			over three hundred years ago...16   KYLE	turns to the nearby table and reaches for something...	then frowns when it isn't there. She glances at	Alexander, then recovers smoothly, as if there were	nothing wrong.					KYLE			There are only fourteen Gilvos			left on Corvan Two. We're			transplanting these two to the			protected planet of Brentalia			where they should thrive.			We are hopeful that the population			can be returned home someday.					(MORE)      STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/9/91 - ACT ONE      19.16   CONTINUED:	(2)					KYLE (cont'd)				(beat)			All right everyone, why don't you			look around for a while on your			own, and if you have any			questions, feel free to ask.17   NEW ANGLE	The group breaks up into father and son pairings and	they move around the bay to explore the different	displays and models. Alexander stays at the Gilvo	container, fascinated by the gentle-looking creatures.	Worf stands next to him, happy that Alexander has	finally found something to attract his attention.18   ON KYLE	As she quietly walks over to Alexander. She is being	very discreet and nonthreatening in her attitude.					KYLE			Alexander?				(he looks up)			I forgot to tell everyone that			the models on the tables are			supposed to be for all of you			to play with.

She keeps her voice low, but her	tone is firm.					KYLE			Lieutenant... I saw Alexander			put the model inside his jacket.	Worf can't believe she still persists in this	ridiculous accusation.

WORF'S QUARTERS	Worf paces in the outer room, struggling to keep his	anger below the surface. Alexander is seated, looking	very small and vulnerable. Uncertain how to deal with	this situation, Worf is seeking refuge in the familiar	mantra of Klingon beliefs and values.					WORF			A Klingon's honor is more			important to him than his life.			A Klingon would gladly face the			most horrible punishment rather			than bring shame or disgrace to			his family name. His word is his			bond... without it, he is nothing.	Worf stops pacing and turns to Alexander.					WORF			Do you understand?	Alexander nods mutely.					WORF			Why did you lie to me?	Alexander thinks for a moment... has difficulty meeting	Worf's eyes.					ALEXANDER			I don't know.     STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/10/91 - ACT TWO     21A.23   CONTINUED:					WORF			Did you fear the punishment you			would receive?	Beat.					ALEXANDER				(small voice)			I don't know.	Worf's anger bubbles to the surface.      STAR TREK: "New Ground" - REV. 10/4/91 - ACT TWO      22.23   CONTINUED:					WORF				(voice rising)			You do not know why you lied, and			yet you did. You do not know why			you stole, and yet you did!	Alexander quails before the wrath of his father and	moves back on the couch in fear. Worf sees the boy's	reaction and immediately pulls himself back. He turns	away and moves into the adjoining room for a moment	to collect himself. Alexander relaxes slightly.24   NEW ANGLE	As Worf lets his anger subside. Finally, he turns and	speaks in a calm, assured manner.					WORF				(calm)			Alexander, come here.	Alexander hesitates for a beat, then goes to his	father.					WORF			When I was a child... younger than			you... I lost my parents, my			family... my people. Everything			I had was taken from me... except			my sense of honor. It was the			one thing I had which was truly			Klingon... and which no one could			take away.	Worf gestures to a small statue of two fighting	Klingons.					WORF				(re: statue)			Do you know who they are?	Alexander thinks for a very long beat.					ALEXANDER				(unsure)			Kahless... ?        STAR TREK: "New Ground" - 10/4/91 - ACT TWO        23.24   CONTINUED:					WORF			And his brother, Morath. They			fought for twelve days and twelve			nights... because Morath had			broken his word... and brought			shame to his family.				(quiet)			When you lie or steal, you			dishonor not only yourself, but			your family.				(beat)			You dishonor me.	The words are damning and hit Alexander almost with	physical force. His lip trembles and he is on the	verge of tears. He looks up at his father with remorse	written all over his face.					ALEXANDER			I'm sorry, father. I won't do			it again. I promise.	Worf hears the sincerity in Alexander's voice and reads	it in his face. Worf nods in approval.					WORF			I accept your word. We will not			speak of this matter again.	Worf puts his hand on Alexander's shoulder and gives	it a small squeeze.									CUT TO:25   EXT.

His eyes fall and	his voice gets quieter.					ALEXANDER			I promise I'll be good at the			Klingon school. I'll make you			proud of me.	Worf studies him for a moment.					WORF			Klingon schools are designed to			be difficult.					(MORE)            STAR TREK: "New Ground" - 10/4/91 - ACT FIVE            58.82   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF (cont'd)			The physical and mental hardships			faced by the students are meant			to build strength and character.				(beat)			However, if you wish to face a			greater challenge... you may stay			here with me.	Alexander's face lights up.					WORF			It will not be easy... for either			one of us... but, perhaps we can			face the challenge together.	Alexander straightens up slightly.					ALEXANDER				(seriously)			I accept your challenge, Father.			I will stay.	Worf nods in grave acceptance.					WORF			I believe your... mother would			be pleased.	After a beat, Alexander's face breaks out into a smile	and Worf returns it as well. Worf puts a hand on his	son's shoulder and we begin to see a real bond forming	between the two for the first time.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
