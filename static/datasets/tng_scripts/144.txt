Worf	is not feeling well, but trying to hide it. Klingons	don't get sick. But as Riker and Data continue their	casual desultory conversation, Worf's faintness	increases.					RIKER			How could a spaceship leave Earth			without some kind of a record?					DATA			Perhaps it was deliberate. They			may have wished to escape			detection.					RIKER			You're suggesting they were			fugitives?					DATA			During the Eugenics Wars a group			of genetically superior humans			ruled the world. After their			defeat some did escape.	Riker is becoming aware of Worf's silence. Riker	stands and looks back at the Klingon. (This is light,	just shoot the breeze conversation.)					RIKER			What do you think, Worf. Can we			handle supermen?	The Klingon lets out a long growling groan, and faints	dead away. Data and Riker rush up the ramp.					RIKER			Medical emergency!

SICKBAY	Worf is on a biobed. Pulaski is running a tricorder	over him, and comparing the hand held readouts to the	overhead display.					WORF			I am fine.					PULASKI			You are not fine, you fainted.					WORF			I did not faint. Klingons do not			faint.					PULASKI			Excuse me, I'll rephrase. This			Klingon suffered a dramatic drop			in blood pressure, his blood			glucose level dropped, there was			deficient blood flow resulting			from perpheral circulatory			failure, in other words he curled			up his toes and laid unconscious			on the floor.					WORF			Doctor, there is no need to insult			me.					PULASKI			Worf, I'm worried. Something's			wrong. Klingons don't faint --			forgive me, but I can't think of			another word which applies --			for no reason. You're sick.					WORF			Klingons don't get sick.					PULASKI				(tartly)			They sure do get stupid. Stay			there!

READY ROOM (OPTICAL)	Picard is seated at his desk thoughtfully knuckling	his chin as he studies the computer screen. This thing	has gotten under his skin, and all his scholarly	instincts are engaged. He is going to find the answer.					PULASKI'S COM VOICE			Captain Picard.					PICARD			Ah, Doctor, how is Worf?11A  INT. SICKBAY					PULASKI			He's in no danger. Worf was			observing a Klingon ritual			involving fasting, and he didn't			take into account that you need			to decrease physical activity as			you decrease caloric intake.			Pulaski out.     STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE     7.11B  INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM	Picard resumes his research. There is a CHIME.					PICARD			Come.	Data ENTERS, and crosses to Picard.					DATA			Sir, there is a discrepancy			between our requisition order			for display panels and the number			actually tendered by the			starbase.					PICARD			How can something so simple			become so complicated?					DATA			Such is the nature of a			bureaucracy?	Suddenly Picard reacts. He leans eagerly into the	computer, and touches a pad.					PICARD				(to himself and cutting				 off Data)			There's more than one way to skin			a bureaucratic cat.					DATA			Sir?					PICARD			There's no record of a launch to			the Ficus quadrant. Not unusual			if you consider the chaos of the			early twenty-second century, but someone			had to load that ship.					DATA			Ah, yes, the manifest.	A page appears on the screen.					PICARD			There it is. The Mariposa, launch			date November 27, 2123. Captain			Walter Granger, commanding.     STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE     8.11B  CONTINUED:					DATA			Mariposa is the Spanish word for			butterfly.					PICARD			Thank you, Data.					DATA			I thought it might be significant.					PICARD			It doesn't appear to be. Ah...			and here is the cargo list.				(in an aside to Data)			You can tell a lot about people			from their luggage. Let's see,			two hundred and twenty five			Yoshimitsu computers, five			monitor beacon satellites, seven			hundred cellular commlinks, fifty			spinning wheels --	Data is confused. (Data and Picard's dialogue should	proceed simultaneously.)					DATA			Spinning wheels? Accessing. A			device for spinning yarn or thread			that consists of a large foot or			hand driven wheel and one spindle.					PICARD			Cattle, chickens, pigs. . . . not			DNA, the actual livestock.				(to Data)			Incredible. Why would anyone			carry such an insane mix of cargo?					DATA			Spindle -- a thin rounded tapering			rod --					PICARD				(exasperated)			Data!	The android jerks himself back to the present, but very	coolly responds.     STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE     9.11B  CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			Perhaps they were planning for			the worst.				(Data goes into				 analysis mode)			In the early twenty-second century			Earth was recovering from World			War III.

But if this was			a ship full of utopians, why			carry the technological baggage?					DATA			Sir, I have insufficient			information from which to form			a cogent theory.					PICARD			I hate a mystery.					DATA				(confused)			But, sir what about Dixon Hill,			and your penchant for detective			fiction --					PICARD				(interrupting)			Allow me to correct myself. I			hate a mystery I cannot solve.	Off Data's thoughtful expression as we GO TO:12   EXT.

Suddenly Worf is in the doorway	carrying a tray set with two delicate, yet spartan	cups, a stone tea pot and a thorn-covered branch with	a single blossom midway up the branch. (The thorns	need to look like curving hooks.)					WORF			I wished to thank you for			protecting my --					PULASKI			Your secret is safe with me.	He sets down the tray, strips several of the thorns	from the branch and tosses them into the steaming pot.					PULASKI				(continuing)			Worf, I'm honored. No one has			ever made the Tea for me.	She plucks off the white blossom, and places it in one	of the cups so the tea pours through its petals. Worf	looks at her in surprise.					WORF			You know the ceremony?					PULASKI			I understand the externals. Not			the mysteries. I'm not a			Klingon.					WORF			You must not drink the tea. It			is deadly to humans.					PULASKI			And none too good for Klingons.					WORF			It is a test of bravery, of one's			ability to look at the face of			mortality. It is also a reminder			that death is an experience best			shared -- like the tea.					PULASKI			Worf, you're a romantic.    STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE    11.12A  CONTINUED:					WORF			It is among the Klingons that			love poetry achieves its fullest			flower.					PULASKI			Hold that thought.	Pulaski leaves the office. Quickly returns with a	hypospray. She pours out Worf's cup, hands it to him.	Gives herself an injection. Picks up her cup, and	drinks. Worf starts to react. She holds him off with	an upraised hand.					PULASKI			Antidote. If we're going to			share, let's share. Now, quote			me a little of that poetry.	Off his expression as we GO TO:13   EXT. SPACE - A SUN (OPTICAL)	Throwing out spectacular flares. We trace one of these	tongues of fire as it seems to almost touch a planet.13A  INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Present are Picard, TROI, Riker, Worf and Data.	Supernumerary at CONN.					DATA			Scans indicate human life form			readings thirty meters below the			planet's surface.					WORF			Hailing on all frequencies,			Captain. So far no response.					DATA			There is no evidence of an			advanced communication network.					PICARD			But the comlinks?					WORF			There is no artifical power			source on the planet.    STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE    12.13A  CONTINUED:					RIKER			But they've got a monitoring			satellite.					TROI			A good thing, too. Without it			we would never have known they			needed help.					DATA			Captain, the stellar flares are			increasing in intensity and			frequency. Computer projections			indicate they will envelope the			planet in three point six hours.					PICARD			Mister Worf, prepare for immediate			evacuation.					WORF			Evacuation will be difficult.			Our shields can be lowered for			transport only between the flares.					TROI			Captain, these people have been			isolated for three hundred			years. We cannot beam them to			the Enterprise without warning.					RIKER			And if they have slipped back			into barbarism the experience			would scare them to death.					PICARD			You'll have to go down there,			Number One.					RIKER			On my way.14   EXT.

In the background we hear the SOUNDS	of people, the bleat of goats, the cackle of chickens,	the squealing of pigs.					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE				(continuing)			Uh... Captain, you better get down			here.	Picard gives Troi an incredulous glance, and she	stifles a giggle. Off Picard's expression as we GO	TO:15A  INT.

CORRIDOR	Picard and Worf are hustling down the corridor. The	Transporter Room doors open, and a terrified chicken	comes clucking and weaving its way into the corridor.	(Worf presses himself against the corridor wall. It's	the elephant and the mouse.) The doors open again, and	out comes a SMALL GIRL who gathers up the hen, and	carries her back into the Transporter Room. Worf and	Picard exchange glances, and follow the child and the	livestock into the Transporter Room.18   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM	It is a scene of chaos. Straw, feathers and animal	droppings litter the platform, and spill out onto the	floor. An older man, DANILO ODELL, dressed in boots,	homespun pants and a handknit sweater, and holding a	flask, is directing traffic and bending O'Brien's ear.	People, all holding some kind of livestock (crates of	chickens, a lamb, a piglet), are milling around the	Transporter Room. (A second wave of Bringloidi, with	Riker among them, are climbing off the transporter	platform.) O'Brien stares in consternation at a goat	on a lead which is sniffing at his pants, and tries	to respond to Danilo.					DANILO			Ah, O'Brien, I should have known			that a good Irishman would be			running this ship, and not some			Frenchy.					O'BRIEN				(to the goat)			Shoo! Shoo, damn you!	Danilo reacts to this, because he's not sure who	O'Brien is addressing.					PICARD			What the devil is going on			here?!    STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT TWO    16.18   CONTINUED:	Danilo saunters toward Picard. Riker notices and	starts pushing through the crowd.					DANILO			Oh, Picard is it. The man who			makes decisions for me and mine			without so much as a by-your-			leave.	Worf doesn't like the man's tone to the captain. He	lets out a low throated rumble. Danilo stares at the	flask, at Worf, gives his head a shake, and carefully	pockets the flask.					DANILO				(re Worf)			Do you generally have him on a			leash?	Worf snarls, but he is a little taken aback by this	insouciance. Riker finally pushes through the crowd.					PICARD			My security chief, Lieutenant			Worf.					DANILO			Danilo Odell, at your service.	He extends his hand to Picard. Picard ignores it.					PICARD			I don't want your service, Mister			Odell. I want this damn			livestock off my ship.					RIKER				(sotto voce to Picard)			You said you didn't want to waste			time arguing.					DANILO			Captain, this damn livestock has			fed our children, been company			to the old and sick and playmates			to the young...					RIKER			And can this man ever argue.    STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT TWO    17.18   CONTINUED: (2)					DANILO			... I couldn't leave them to			die. Besides, how can we rebuild			without our animals?	This is beginning to appeal to Picard's sense of the	absurd.					PICARD			Alright.

Worf follows.18A  INT. CORRIDOR					PICARD			Er... fine, and then Mister Worf			can show you the ship.					DANILO			That would be grand.

TURBOLIFT					DANILO			You're sure?					PICARD			Yes!	Danilo holds up his hands placatingly, and backs out of	the turbolift. Off Picard's reactions as we GO TO:    STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT TWO    19.19   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Present are Picard, Riker, Worf and Pulaski.					PICARD				(to Pulaski)			What is the colonists' overall			condition?					PULASKI			They're a little hungry, a little			scared, but hiding it well. They			were suffering from an amazing			variety of preventable diseases -- but			the transporter handled			that. They're also tough,			determined and fun. Overall,			I'd say they're charming examples			of homo sapiens at their best.	Worf ENTERS.					PICARD				(to Worf)			What's the total?					WORF			Two hundred and twenty-three.					PULASKI			Count on four more in the next			few days.					PICARD			Next question, what to do with			them? Take them to a starbase?			They were anachronistic in 2123.			How will they cope?					RIKER			There's no question they could			learn and adapt, but it would be			dislocating, and the colony would			probably be splintered. Maybe			we should be looking for a new			home for them?	Suddenly there is a strident klaxon as an internal	alarm goes off. Worf taps his insignia.					WORF			Lieutenant Worf, report!    STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT TWO    20.19   CONTINUED:					COMPUTER VOICE			Fire in Cargo Hold Seven.					RIKER			The Bringloidi!	Everyone is heading for the door.					PICARD				(to Riker)			I wonder what they've done to my			ship now.	And despite his concern Riker has to grin.20   INT. CORRIDOR	Outside of the cargo hold. TWO SECURITY MEN are	already there as Worf, Picard and Riker arrive.					PICARD			Unseal the doors.	Worf punches in the override code into the computer and	the doors open. Danilo staggers out. He is drenched,	clutching his heart, really playing this to the hilt.					DANILO			My God, Picard, the place is a			bloody death trap! Lightning			bolts falling from the ceiling!	Picard, Riker and Worf follow Danilo back into the	cargo hold.20A  INT. CARGO HOLD	People are milling about, subdued, frightened chatter	fills the hold.					DANILO				(continuing)			What the hell was that thing?					WORF			Automated fire system. A force			field contains the flames until			the available oxygen within the			field has been consumed.    STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT TWO    21.20A  CONTINUED:					DANILO			What if I had been under that			thing?					WORF			You would have been standing in			the fire.	Danilo glares at the Klingon, not sure if he's being	made the butt of a joke, but that dark, impassive face	gives away nothing.					DANILO			Well, ignoring that for the			moment. What would have happened			to me?					WORF			You would have suffocated and			died.					DANILO			Sweet mercy.	Danilo has led the officers to a corner where a few	slightly charred sticks are surrounded by a wide pool	of spilled soup. A large iron cauldron is tipped on	its side, obviously the source of this mess. Standing	near this mess like an outraged goddess is Danilo's	daughter BRENNA. She is a stunningly beautiful young	woman, and her soaked gown is revealing every lovely	curve. Arms militantly akimbo she eyes Picard.					BRENNA			Your hospitality leaves a hell			of a lot to be desired! You don't			offer us a bite or a sup, and when			we build a fire to cook a little			something, the place goes mad!	She flings aside the ladel she is holding. Riker is	staring in wonder at Brenna.					PICARD			My apologies, ma'am, I was unaware			that you had not been instructed			in the use of the food dispensers.					BRENNA				(truculently to Riker)			And what are you staring at?

She	glances pointedly down at his hand, up at him.					BRENNA			You may have all the time in the			world, but I've dozens of			frightened and hungry women and			children to care for.					RIKER			What about the men?					BRENNA				(with asperity)			I'm sure they'll find their			comfort as they always do -- in			the bottom of a mug of home brew!	She disappears around some cargo containers and hung	blankets.					DANILO				(to Riker with an				 ingratiating smile)			Pay her no heed, she's a grand			girl. And not usually so...			er...				(he coughs)			... sharp tongued.					BRENNA (V.O.)				(like a Banshee)			Father!	Danilo darts away at Brenna's bellow.

Riker suddenly pauses and says a little too	casually.					RIKER			I think I'll go give her some			help, Captain.	Worf and Picard EXIT the shot, and Riker walks back to	Brenna.

Then	lifts the sodden hem of her skirt, and inspects her	feet.					BRENNA				(continuing, cooing				 like a dove)			Where does a girl go to wash her			feet on this ship?					RIKER			I think it's the responsibility			of the ship's first officer to			show that girl all the amenities.	Riker holds out a hand to her.

Pulaski runs a device over the OLD	MAN'S arm, and cures his crippling rheumatoid	arthritis. His claw-like hand relaxes and he	experimentally wiggles the fingers. Brenna is amazed.	This is magic. The old man is so pleased with this	new mobility that as Pulaski turns away to replace the	device he leans off the biobed, and pinches her on	the ass. Pulaski calmly swats his hand.					PULASKI			Behave yourself.					OLD MAN			You're a fine woman, and you've			made a young man of me.					PULASKI			No, I've cured your arthritis,			and if you try anything more			energetic you'll probably drop			dead.   STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT THREE   27.24   CONTINUED:					OLD MAN				(with a leer)			I'd die happy.					PULASKI			Out.	He hobbles past Brenna and Riker with a wink and	another leer. Pulaski crosses to the couple.					BRENNA			You know how to handle men.					PULASKI			Yes, first you have to get their			attention.	Riker chuckles. He doesn't mind being made the butt of	a joke. Brenna crosses to Pulaski.					BRENNA			How did you give Joey back his			hand?					PULASKI				(picking up the				 instrument)			Oh dear, that would be difficult			to explain.					BRENNA				(frustrated)			Like everything else aboard this			ship. I'm too ignorant to			understand. And this is the one			thing that looks useful.	The frustration is evident in her voice. Pulaski says	very gently --					PULASKI			You're interested in medicine?					BRENNA			I'm healer and midwife.

Dinner, Brenna?			I'll cook.	Brenna glances at Pulaski and raises her eyebrows.	Leans in close, keeping it private between the two of	them.					BRENNA			Is he real?	Both of the women are eyeing Riker thoughtfully.					PULASKI				(sotto voce to Brenna)			Oh, yes, very real.	The message is subtle -- when life offers you	something... take it.

Pulaski has her tricorder in her lap.					GRANGER			Captain, we need your help.			Three hundred years ago during			our landing on Mariposa, the skin			of the ship was breached. Only			five colonists survived. The			progenitors weren't willing to			just give up and die, and they			were scientists --					PICARD			So they used that expertise and			turned to cloning.					GRANGER			Yes. They had no other option.			Two women and three men were an			insufficient gene pool from which			to build a society.					PULASKI			How did you suppress the natural			sexual drive? Drugs? Punitive			laws?    STAR TREK: "Send In The Clones" - 3/17/89 - ACT FOUR    41.33   CONTINUED:					GRANGER			In the beginning we used a little			of both. Now three hundred years			later the entire concept of			sexual reproduction is a little			repugnant to us.					PICARD			A culture with no children.					GRANGER			It's economically more viable to			accelerate clone growth. Some			basic learning can be chemically			imprinted on the developing clone,			the rest we do after emergence.					PULASKI			How did you overcome the problem			of replicative fading?					GRANGER			We didn't.					PULASKI			You have got a problem.					RIKER			Wait.
