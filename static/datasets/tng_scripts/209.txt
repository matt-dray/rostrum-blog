But try and			imagine what a young Caesar might			have done differently if someone			had given him a hint of what lay			ahead. Or, if Lincoln had been			coerced into changing his theater			plans. I truly wish I could be			more specific on why you were			selected, but I'm afraid the			exchange of information will have			to flow in one direction only.	As Rasmussen talks, he walks to the door and paces out	the distance to the window.					RASMUSSEN			...four... five... six... seven			meters. HA! I was right!	Off Picard's look...9    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Picard, Riker, Worf, BEVERLY, TROI, Data and Geordi.	Rasmussen is sitting beside Picard.					WORF			Why now?					GEORDI			Right. If you came back to study			us, to study the captain, why did			you pick today? Why not a year			ago... or a year from now?					RASMUSSEN			Oh, I picked the right day			alright.

Why?					RASMUSSEN				(shakes his head and				 smiles)			It's not important.	Worf is starting to dislike this man.					RIKER			Tell me, Professor, at what point			does time travel become a tool			for historians?					RASMUSSEN			Now, now, Commander. You know			better than that. I've studied			a great deal about your century.			Including the fact that you're			all quite aware of the dangers			of anyone altering the past. And			that's exactly what I'd be doing			if I were to divulge information			like that.					BEVERLY			Telurian plague!					RASMUSSEN			I beg your pardon?					BEVERLY			Telurian plague... was it cured?			I mean, has it been cured by your			century? There can't be any harm			in asking that.	Rasmussen turns to Picard for help.					PICARD			I realize it will be difficult,			but we must all keep our questions			regarding the future to ourselves.			Professor...	Rasmussen stands.   STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/26/91 - ACT ONE   10.9    CONTINUED: (2)					RASMUSSEN			I'll be preparing questionnaires			for each of you.

TURBOLIFT	Rasmussen and Data. The lift is in motion. Rasmussen	is inspecting Data like a car enthusiast would a	vintage Ferrari.					RASMUSSEN			This is really a thrill, Data.			Like running across a Redstone			missile or a Guttenberg bible.			To think... the Model T of			androids.	The lift stops and the doors open.

CORRIDOR	as Rasmussen and Data head for Rasmussen's quarters.					DATA			If you're referring to the first			production model automobile of			the twentieth century, perhaps the			subsequent Model A might be a more			apt analogy since I am Noonian			Soong's revised prototype.	Rasmussen continues to check Data out as they reach his	quarters.					RASMUSSEN			I stand corrected.	The door opens and they go in...12   INT.

Rasmussen walks to the sink and	begins to wash his hands.					DATA				(almost shy)			Would I be correct, Professor,			in assuming that you know whether			or not I am still... alive in			the twenty-sixth century?	Rasmussen ignores Data. He finishes washing and holds	out his hand, treating Data like a men's room	attendant. After a beat, Data catches on and hands him	a towel.					DATA				(continuing his line				 of questioning)			Since you seemed to know so much			about Captain Picard and the			ship...

But you			must see that if I were to			influence you, everything in this			sector, in this quadrant of the			galaxy could change. History, my			history, would unfold in a way			other than it already has. Now			what possible incentive could			anyone offer me to allow that to			happen?					PICARD			I have two choices. Either way,			one version or another of history			will wend its way forward. The			history you know or another one.			Who's to say which is better?			All I know here, today, is that			one way, millions of lives could			be saved. Isn't that incentive			enough?					RASMUSSEN			Everyone dies, Captain. It's just			a question of when. All of those			people down there died years			before I was born. All of you			up here, as well. So you see,			I can't get quite as worked up			as you over the fate of some			colonists who, for me, have been			dead a long time.					PICARD			We have a Prime Directive,			Professor, which tells us we have			no right to interfere with the			natural evolution of alien worlds.					(MORE)  STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT FOUR  44.42   CONTINUED: (4)					PICARD (cont'd)			But even though I am sworn to			uphold it, I have disregarded that			directive on more than one			occasion... When I knew it was			the right thing to do. If you			are holding true to some			"temporal" equivalent of that			directive, isn't there a			possibility that this is an			occasion for you to make an			exception, to help me choose...			because it's the right thing to			do?					RASMUSSEN			Are we just talking about a			choice? It sounds to me like			you're trying to manipulate the			future.					PICARD			Every choice we make allows us			to manipulate the future. Do I			ask Marie or Suzanne to the spring			dance? Do I take my holiday on			Tahiti or on Risa? A man's life,			his future, hinges on each of a			thousand choices.
