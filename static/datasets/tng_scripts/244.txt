SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	docked at a GIANT ARRAY of some kind in orbit above a	planet. The ship is sandwiched between two banks of	reflector dishes.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 46682.4.			The Enterprise is docked at the			Remmler Array, where it will			undergo a routine procedure to			eliminate accumulated baryon			particles. In preparation for the			sweep, we are evacuating the ship.2    INT. CORRIDOR	We see the commotion of evacuation, N.D.s crisscrossing	in the corridor. PICARD, rounds the corner, a	purposefulness in his stride. He soon encounters TROI,	PADD in hand, waiting to speak with him. They talk on	the move.					TROI			Captain... we're still behind			schedule on decks seven and eight.			Shall I tell Arkaria Base there'll			be a delay?					PICARD			No. Open up the Transporters in			Cargo Bay Two and divert everyone			from deck seven there. That			should get us back on track.					TROI			Right.	Picard nods and moves on.    STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - REV. - 01/15/93 - TEASER    2.2    CONTINUED:	He now passes by BEVERLY, who falls into step with him	and we STAY with them, on the move.					BEVERLY			Captain... Arkaria Base does not			have the medical storage units I			requested. I have seven living			tissue samples that won't survive			the baryon sweep anymore than you			or I would. I've tried to reason			with them, but --					PICARD			Have Mister LaForge transport a			stasis unit from the astrophysics			lab. You should be able to			convert it to store tissue			samples.					BEVERLY			Thank you.	She smiles, turns, heads back to Sickbay. Picard	continues on.3    TURBOLIFT ENTRANCE	The doors whoosh open and RIKER steps off... just in	time to intercept the approaching Picard. Behind	Riker, the Turbolift doors close.					RIKER			Captain... I was just heading for			deck seven. I've put the auto-shutdown			sequence on hold until we			get back on schedule.					PICARD			I think we can resume the			sequence. Counselor Troi is			taking care of the situation on			deck seven.					RIKER			Aye, sir.	The two head in opposite directions. The Turbolift	doors again whisk open as Picard approaches.       STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - 01/14/93 - TEASER       3.4    INT. TURBOLIFT	We see DATA inside.					DATA			Captain.					PICARD			Mister Data.				(as he faces front)			Bridge.	The doors close and the Turbolift's in motion. A	silent beat.					DATA			It has been quite a day, has it			not?	Picard's one-tracked, no time for chit-chat... but at	the same time he's a bit surprised at Data's	uncharacteristic approach.					PICARD			Yes it has.	Beat.					DATA			However, a change of routine is			often invigorating and can be a			welcome diversion after a long			assignment.					PICARD				(more of the same)			Exactly.	Beat.					DATA			I understand that Arkaria has some			very interesting weather patterns.	Picard gives Data a look...					PICARD			Data -- are you alright?					DATA			Yes, sir. I was attempting to			fill a silent moment with non-relevant			conversation.       STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - 01/14/93 - TEASER       4.4    CONTINUED:					PICARD				(thinks)			Small talk?					DATA			Yes, sir. I have found that			humans often make "small talk"			during awkward moments.			Therefore, I have written a new			subroutine designed for that			purpose. How did I do?					PICARD			Perhaps it was a little too... non-relevant.			However, if you're			interested in small talk keep your			eye on Commander Hutchinson during			the reception this afternoon...				(not looking forward to				 it)			... he's a master.	The Turbolift STOPS and they both EXIT onto the Bridge.					DATA			Thank you sir, I will.5    INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS	Picard and Data ENTER to find the last leg of a	frenetic race: Bridge regulars and a handful of N.D.s	shutting down consoles. Picard is set upon	simultaneously by Geordi and Worf.                GEORDI                             WORF          I just finished...           Request permission...					GEORDI				(to Worf)			After you...					WORF				(to Geordi)			No sir. I believe you spoke			first.					PICARD			We're running out of time,			gentlemen. Mister Worf?       STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - 01/14/93 - TEASER       5.5    CONTINUED:					WORF			The computer needs your			authorization to disable command			functions during the baryon sweep.					PICARD			Are we ready, Mister La Forge?					GEORDI			Almost. I've requested some			additional field diverters for the			computer core and the Bridge and			they haven't been installed yet.					PICARD				(concerned)			Additional units?					GEORDI			We've logged more warp hours in			five years than most ships do in			ten, so our baryon particle levels			are pretty high. I'm a little			worried that when the Remmler			Array starts sweeping the ship it			might have to use a stronger beam			than normal to clear out all the			radiation.					PICARD				(understanding)			And that might overload the field			diverters protecting our key			systems. How long until the new			ones are in place?					GEORDI			I'd say another twenty minutes.					PICARD			Very well.				(to com)			Computer, disable all command			functions in thirty minutes.			Authorization: Picard gamma-six-zero-seven-three.					COMPUTER VOICE			Authorization acknowledged.	Worf's console BEEPS.       STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - 01/14/93 - TEASER       6.5    CONTINUED: (2)					WORF				(off console)			Incoming message, Captain. It's			the station administrator, Mister			Orton.					PICARD			In my Ready Room.					WORF			Sir. Request permission to be			excused from Commander			Hutchinson's... reception.					PICARD			Permission granted. I only wish			I could excuse myself as well.					GEORDI			Captain, permission to --					PICARD			Sorry, Mister LaForge... I can't			excuse the entire senior staff.			Worf beat you to it.	Picard EXITS to the Ready Room. Worf looks pleased and	Geordi gives him a dirty look.6    INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUING	Picard ENTERS, goes behind his desk, and activates the	terminal.					PICARD			Go ahead, Mister Orton.	He gets out his satchel and, under the following, loads	it with odds and ends.					ORTON'S COM VOICE			Captain, if you're on schedule,			I'd like to confirm that we'll			begin the baryon sweep at fifteen			hundred hours -- approximately one			hour from now.					PICARD			Confirmed.       STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - 01/14/93 - TEASER       6A.6    CONTINUED:					ORTON'S COM VOICE			Commander Hutchinson also wanted			me to make sure that you'll be			able to attend his reception this			afternoon.	Picard's expression tells us that he's not exactly	thrilled about this particular event.					PICARD			Tell him... I'm looking forward to			it.					ORTON'S COM VOICE			He'll be delighted to hear that.			Arkaria Base out.	Picard closes his satchel. Time to go.       STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - 01/14/93 - TEASER       7.7    INT. BRIDGE	Picard ENTERS to find it... empty. It takes him a	moment to adjust. He walks around, drinks in the	solitude, savors it. Finally, he sits in his chair.	A long, quiet beat...8    NEW ANGLE - INCLUDE TURBOLIFTS	Suddenly, the fore and aft Turbolifts OPEN and SIX	TECHNICIANS ENTER the Bridge: four humanoids --	KELSEY, NEIL, POMET and DEVOR and two aliens -- SATLER,	and KIROS. (Full descriptions to follow later in the	script). They are all wearing plain-looking overalls	and two of them are carrying FIELD DIVERTERS -- about	the size and shape of a trash can -- while the others	carry Tricorders and other pieces of equipment.	As soon as the doors open, they fill the Bridge with	noise and chatter, effectively destroying Picard's	brief moment of solitude.					KELSEY				(overlapping)			Tell Arkaria base that we're			almost finished here...					NEIL				(overlapping)			We're going to need two more			conduits...					KIROS				(overlapping)			I need to run a diagnostic on the			diverter...					DEVOR				(overlapping)			Get the diverter aligned so that			we can begin the isolation			procedure.					NEIL				(overlapping)			Where's the ODN interface?	Picard heads for the Turbolift over the above and the	technicians take no notice of him.       STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - 01/14/93 - TEASER       8.9    ON PICARD	He stops and gives one last look around. So much for	peace and quiet. And as he ENTERS the Turbolift...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                             STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - REV. - 01/15/93 - ACT ONE   9.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:           (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)            10   EXT. ARKARIA BASE - DAY (OPTICAL)	A lone outpost in the middle of nowhere...11   INT. ARKARIA BASE - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM	A festive reception is underway. There's a CONTROL	PANEL at one end, but the room otherwise has a party	feel to it. There are tables of food. A WAITER	circulates with drinks. ORTON can be seen in the b.g.12   ANGLE - HUTCHINSON	As he works the room. Hutchinson is a middle-aged,	jovial man who lives for gatherings like this and loves	nothing more than to entertain a starship crew. Data	is quietly observing Hutchinson's technique and he	unobtrusively follows the gregarious Commander about	the room, watching and learning.					HUTCHINSON			Beverly!				(kiss on the cheek)			Lovely as ever... how do you			manage it?					BEVERLY			It's good to see you again.					HUTCHINSON			It's been far too long -- what is			it, four years? Now I want to			hear all about what happened after			you left Starfleet Medical. And			I have so much to tell you.				(sees someone else)			Oh, that must be Commander Riker.			Excuse me, won't you?					BEVERLY			Of course.	Beverly is quietly grateful that he's moved on and she	takes a drink off a tray in relief.   STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - REV. - 01/15/93 - ACT ONE   10.12   CONTINUED:					HUTCHINSON			You must be Wil Riker.					RIKER			I guess I must.					HUTCHINSON			Calvin Hutchinson -- call me			Hutch. Calvin -- awful name, I've			never forgiven my parents. As			soon as I saw you, I knew you had			to be the Enterprise's first			officer.					RIKER			Oh?					HUTCHINSON			Of course. Your reputation			proceeds you -- flashing blue			eyes, square jaw... quite the			ladies man I hear. Now don't be			modest, Wil -- may I call you Wil?					RIKER			Uh, sure.					HUTCHINSON			I've also heard that you're a			musician. I hope you'll play			something for us. It's not often			that I get a chance to entertain			the command crew of the			flagship... and speaking of			command, hello Captain Picard.	Riker takes this opportunity to slip quietly away and	leave Picard. Picard's face has that frozen smile of	forced cheerfulness on it as Hutchinson natters on.					PICARD			Commander.					HUTCHINSON			I was just telling your first			officer what a real pleasure it is			to have you all...13   NEW ANGLE	As Riker moves over to stand with Beverly. Riker gives	her a look and she smiles in commiseration.      STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - 01/14/93 - ACT ONE      11.13   CONTINUED:	Data (who has been observing Hutchinson) approaches the	two of them. He tries to talk quickly and easily --	patterning his behavior after Hutchinson.					DATA			It is very good to see you both			again. May I call you Beverly? --			Beverly, do you find the mean			temperature here on Arkaria to be			slightly above normal for human			comfort levels?	Riker and Beverly exchange a look... they can't believe	this.					DATA			I have found that most humans			prefer a temperature of twenty-one			degrees C in order to operate most			efficiently. However, there are			some cultures which actually...14   PICARD AND HUTCHINSON	Hutchinson is going on as Picard looks for a way out.					HUTCHINSON			... I tell you, you've never seen			anything like it. There were			thousands of these creatures...			the whole northern sky turned			dark.	Picard suddenly sees a way out as Geordi and Troi walk	by.					PICARD			Geordi! Deanna! I don't believe			you've met our host.				(to Hutchinson)			Allow me to introduce Commander			Geordi La Forge, Counselor Deanna			Troi. This is Commander			Hutchinson.					HUTCHINSON			Hutch.					GEORDI			Hello.					TROI			Hello.      STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - 01/14/93 - ACT ONE      12.14   CONTINUED:					HUTCHINSON			I was just telling your captain			about some of the fascinating			sights here on Arkaria. Is either			of you interested in ornithology?					TROI			Uh... well...	Picard is starting to make his getaway.					HUTCHINSON			The mating habits of the Arkarian			horn fowl are quite interesting.			If the weather were better, we			could take horses to the southern			promontory and visit the nesting			grounds.	Picard stops, turns.					PICARD			Horses?					HUTCHINSON			Yes... there's a network of trails			through the plains.			Unfortunately, they aren't very			pleasant right now... muddy, cold.			Not a soul for kilometers.					PICARD			That sounds... perfect.				(beat, then to Geordi)			How long until the baryon sweep			begins on the Enterprise?					GEORDI			At least twenty-five minutes.					PICARD			Then I'll have time to get my			saddle.	This is met with blank stares from the other three.					TROI			Your... saddle?      STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - 01/14/93 - ACT ONE      13.14   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Yes.				(notices their looks)			A saddle is a very personal thing.			It has to be broken in... worn...			cared for...					GEORDI			You keep a saddle... on the			Enterprise?					PICARD			Yes.				(beat)			I've had it since the Academy.				(beat)			I never know when I'll have the			opportunity to ride.					TROI			I see.					PICARD			It's perfectly normal. Most			serious riders have their own			saddles.					TROI			Of course.					GEORDI			Yes, sir.					HUTCHINSON			Absolutely.					PICARD			If you'll excuse me.	They smile as Picard EXITS. But the mirth on Troi and	Geordi's faces vanishes as they soon realize that they	still have Hutchinson to deal with and that they have	no smooth way out.					HUTCHINSON				(re: Picard)			An amazing man. He reminds me of			another officer I knew many years			ago... a Captain Edwell. Now he			was fascinating... born on Gaspra			Seven but you wouldn't know it			from the way he looked...   STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - REV. - 01/15/93 - ACT ONE   14.14   CONTINUED: (3)	Off their strained expressions...                                             CUT TO:15   INT. CORRIDOR	The door to Picard's quarters opens and Picard ENTERS	the corridor, his saddle slung over his shoulder. He	has now changed into civilian clothes -- casual work	clothes with a jacket.					COMPUTER VOICE			Auto-shutdown sequence in			progress. Defensive systems off-line.			Baryon sweep begins in			eight minutes.	Picard walks just a little faster. Then he rounds a	bend and sees something. He slows, looking concerned.16   PICARD'S POV (OPTICAL)	A wall panel just above floor level has been removed,	some fiber-optic cables yanked out. Picard approaches,	sets his saddle down and kneels to inspect the open	panel. Suddenly --					DEVOR'S VOICE			What are you doing?	Picard looks up to see Devor, one of the technical	crew, standing over him, a pistol-size laser-welder in	his hand. Picard rises, wary.					PICARD			Somone left this ODN junction box			open.				(beat)			I thought your crew was supposed			to leave the ship once the field			diverters were in place.					DEVOR			The diverters have to be			synchronized.				(re: laser)			I was laser-bonding a backup link.	Picard regards him evenly.   STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - REV. - 01/15/93 - ACT ONE   15.16   CONTINUED:					PICARD			I see. Well, I suppose I'd better			let you finish up so you can get			off the ship.	Picard scoops up his saddle, moves off, his back to	Devor. The alien realizes Picard suspects something.					DEVOR			Wait a minute --	As Picard turns, Devor raises the laser-welder, but	Picard has anticipated him. He slams Devor with the	saddle, sending him back hard into the wall. The	welder DISCHARGES into the air.	Devor springs back into a combat stance... but Picard	is ready for him. He dodges, yanks him around in a	hammer lock and wedges the side of his hand into	Devor's carotid. Devor struggles for a second, then	slumps.					COMPUTER VOICE			Auto shut-down sequence in			progress. Inertial dampers off-line.			Baryon sweep begins in six			minutes.	Then the lights go out. Backup lighting kicks in --	slightly dimmer than what we're used to (and we'll see	this all over the ship from now on).	Picard takes off -- fast, without his saddle -- and	heads for Transporter Room One.17   ANOTHER CORRIDOR	Picard is moving fast when he hears voices ahead. He	slows and squeezes back against the side wall.					COMPUTER VOICE			Auto shut-down sequence in			progress. Life support off-line.			Baryon sweep begins in three			minutes.18   NEW ANGLE - INCLUDE INTERSECTION AHEAD	Kelsey and Neil round the bend headed in the same	direction Picard was going. They don't see Picard, but	they've unwittingly cut him off.   STAR TREK: "Starship Mine" - REV. - 01/18/93 - ACT ONE   16.18   CONTINUED:					KELSEY				(to Neil)			We still have to by-pass the			magnetic containment conduit.					NEIL			That should be down on deck			thirty.					KELSEY			Get Pomet started on it right			away.					COMPUTER VOICE			Auto shut-down sequence in			progress.
