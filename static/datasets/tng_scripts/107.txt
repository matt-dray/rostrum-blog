Which could mean they			can shield their thoughts and			emotions from others.					PICARD			Which still makes it our move.					TROI			Sir, they may know as little about			us as we do about them.					RIKER			Except that they know they've got			us in deep trouble.					PICARD			If so, the question becomes how			will they use that knowledge?				(to Data)			Is there any hard information on			them in any file, Data?					DATA			None, sir. Only hearsay and			thirdhand reports, most of which			conflict.					RIKER			Which rumors do not conflict?					DATA			That the Ferengi are... well, the			best description may be "traders."					PICARD			What kind of "traders"?      STAR TREK: "The Last Outpost" - 8/7/87 - ACT ONE      9.14   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			A more accurate comparison modern			scholars have drawn from Earth			history cites the ocean-going			"Yankee Traders" of eighteenth			and nineteenth century America,			sir.					RIKER			From the history of my forebears?			"Yankee Traders?"					DATA				(nods)			Who sail, in this case the			galaxy, in search of mercantile			and territorial opportunity.					RIKER			And are those scholars saying			the Ferengi may not be too			different from us?					DATA			Hardly, sir. I believe this			analogy refers to the nefarious			capitalist manner in which the			Ferengi are known to conduct their			affairs of commerce.				(thought)			"Never give a sucker an even			break."	Picard and Riker exchange puzzled looks.					PICARD			And what does that mean, Data?					DATA			I'm not sure, sir. That entry was			only identified as "slang", terms			or expressions which typify			everyday language of...					PICARD			I know what slang is, Data. I just			haven't heard of that particular			saying.					RIKER			But "Yankee Traders"...				(smile)			I like the sound of that.

Red,			white and blue for the United			States...				(muses)			Whereas the French oddly used the			same colors in the order of blue,			white, and red...					DATA			... and the German nation black,			red and gold; the Italians green,			white and red; the British...      STAR TREK: "The Last Outpost" - 8/7/87 - ACT ONE      11.14   CONTINUED: (4)					PICARD				(annoyed)			Enough, Data!					DATA			Sir, it was you who...					PICARD				(snaps)			We're discussing the Ferengi,			Data!				(slow burn)			Mon Dieu, I wish I knew what they			will do next...					DATA			Given what is occurring to our			vessel, Captain, their weapons			could be vastly superior to ours.	Picard has to fight off irritation again.					PICARD			Yes, Data.

ENTERPRISE - ENGINE ROOM	Riker, Geordi and TWO ENGINEERS anguish over the control	board.					RIKER			Bottom line, La Forge.					GEORDI			Not good, sir. The Ferengi			forcefield that holds this ship			compensates...				(taps board)			Almost as fast as we increase			power.					RIKER			Almost?	Using his hands as a demonstration, Geordi tries to	explain the "isometric" problem of the forcefield.      STAR TREK: "The Last Outpost" - 8/7/87 - ACT ONE      12.14A  CONTINUED:					GEORDI			There's a point-three-hundred,			seventy-two millisecond delay			between use of our power and the			neutralizing counter-force of the			Ferengi...				(stumped)			We push and they push back in			equal force, sir.					RIKER				(idea)			And what is our acceleration delay			between slow-reverse impulse and			top warp speed?					GEORDI			Point-three-hundred millisecond.				(big smile)			I know what you're thinking. Shift			down and then blow hard into warp			nine, yes? Come back fighting,			whooey!					RIKER			Can we do it, Geordi?					GEORDI			Ask me after it's done, sir.				(to Engineers)			I want a slow reverse-power			drop-off over five minutes...				(to Riker)			We'll show them what this baby			can do, sir.					RIKER			Give me everything you've got.					GEORDI			Aye, aye, sir.	At that, Riker EXITS, as CAMERA TIGHTENS on Geordi.14B  INT.

They're wondering			what we are thinking... and what			we might do next.					WORF			I say fight, sir. There is			nothing shameful in falling before			a superior enemy.	Geordi ENTERS the Bridge from the turbolift.					PICARD				(thin smile at Worf)			And nothing shameful about a			strategic retreat, either.					GEORDI			All systems ready, Captain.
