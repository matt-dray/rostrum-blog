DATA'S QUARTERS	RIKER, PULASKI, GEORDI, DATA, and WORF, in that order,	sit around the table playing poker. By far, Worf has	the biggest stack of chips.					RIKER				(eyeing his cards)			Lookin' good. I say... five.	Riker throws in five chips. Pulaski meets the bet.					PULASKI			Five here.					GEORDI				(adding chips)			And five more.					DATA				(evaluating)			I believe the wiser course of			action here is to bend.					GEORDI			You mean fold.					DATA			That is correct. Fold -- to bend,			make compact or give in.	Data lays his cards on the table. All eyes on Worf.	Worf calmly counts the right amount of chips and puts	them in the pile. Then he adds two more large stacks	of chips.					WORF			I raise fifty.	Everyone is taken aback.					DATA			I do not believe Lieutenant Worf			understands all the nuances of			this betting procedure.        STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/14/89 - TEASER        2.1    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Don't be too quick to judge, Data.			His pile's a lot bigger than			yours.					PULASKI			Than all of ours.					DATA			The cards have been favoring the			Lieutenant, but that is the result			of random chance... hence it is			a temporary condition.					GEORDI			You hope.					WORF			Talk or play. Not both.	Riker thinks it over.					RIKER			Fifty, right?					PULASKI			Fifty is the bet. What's the			matter -- are your feet getting			cold?					RIKER			No, just my cards...	He bets, somewhat less sure of himself.					PULASKI			Thanks for staying in -- I need			the chips.					RIKER			Got to earn them first.					PULASKI			Oh, I will. This pot has my name			on it.					GEORDI			Talk, talk, talk...	Pulaski bets.        STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/14/89 - TEASER        2A.1    CONTINUED: (2)					PULASKI			Here's some action. Fifty...				(adds more)			... and another fifty.					GEORDI				(backpedalling)			Fold, fold, fold...	Geordi throws in his hand. Worf pushes out four	stacks of chips and adds another two.					WORF			Your fifty, and fifty more.	Riker looks at Worf and at Pulaski -- who stare at each	other. Pulaski smiles but Worf is deadpan.					RIKER			Love to stay in -- but not with			these cards.	Riker folds.					PULASKI				(to Worf)			Looks like it's just you and me,			handsome.	Worf is a statue. Pulaski gathers up the needed	amount. It takes every last chip she has, but --					PULASKI (cont'd)			I'll see you.	Pulaski pushes in the needed amount. Everyone stares	at Worf as he slowly puts down his cards. A full house	-- aces over queens.					PULASKI (cont'd)			Beats my straight.	Everyone except Worf SIGHS as the tension is released.        STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/10/89 - TEASER        3.1    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			The Iceman wins again.					PULASKI			You took my last chip. You could			at least smile, Worf.	Worf says nothing; he simply pulls in all the chips	and stacks them, preparing for the next hand.					GEORDI			Smiling might break his			concentration.					PULASKI			If you don't enjoy winning -- what			do you enjoy? Losing?					RIKER			We'd be happy to accommodate you.	Worf, unruffled, collects the cards and hands them to	Data.					WORF			Your deal.	Data takes the cards, shuffles them like an old pro,	and deals.					DATA			The game is seven card stud; after			the queen, one-eyed jacks and low			card in the hole are wild.					GEORDI			Let me write this down.					RIKER			Just deal. I'd like to get some			of my losings back before the next			century.	Pulaski and Geordi CHUCKLE.					WORF			I open with fifty.1A   NEW ANGLE	A moment of stunned silence -- broken by:      STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - REV. 4/12/89 - TEASER      4.1A   CONTINUED:					FEMALE COM VOICE			Bridge to Commander Riker. We			are receiving a class eleven			emergency signal from Starfleet			Command.	Instantly, the players throw their cards onto the	table, get to their feet --					RIKER			On my way.	-- and head for the door. As they cross:					GEORDI				(to Worf)			Fifty? You were bluffing.					WORF			Klingons never bluff.	Geordi gives Worf a look of uncertainty -- is Worf	kidding? -- as the group EXITS.2    OMITTED3    INT.

Riker, Data, and Worf ENTER	and take their stations; Data relieves the	supernumerary at Ops, examines readouts.					PICARD			Mister Data?					DATA			Emergency signal reads as follows:			Enterprise to divert to			coordinates four-two-three by			one-one-two by five-one			immediately.

MAIN BRIDGE	Picard, Riker, Worf, Data, and Ensign Clancey as	before.					DATA			Our destination is a point near			the Boradis system.					PICARD			That area was colonized fairly			recently, as I recall.					DATA				(nods)			The first Federation outpost was			established thirty-four years ago			on Boradis Three.					RIKER			And since then, the Federation			has colonized several planets in			that sector.					DATA			Yet we are not headed for a			specific colony. The coordinates			given are outside the Boradis			system.					PICARD			Any problems reported in that			area?					DATA			None.					PICARD			Then what the devil's going on?					WORF			Captain, Starfleet Command is			hailing us.					PICARD			It's about time.

And -- the mission?					ADMIRAL GROMEK			The envoy will fill you in. You			are to cooperate fully.					PICARD			Can you give me any details?					ADMIRAL GROMEK			Negative.					PICARD			Admiral, I find it difficult to			prepare for a mission I know			nothing about.					ADMIRAL GROMEK				(softening)			I sympathize, Jean-Luc, but			Starfleet Command considers this			a top-security matter.	The admiral permits herself a thin smile.        STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/10/89 - ACT ONE        8.6A   CONTINUED:					ADMIRAL GROMEK (cont'd)			After the envoy's briefed you,			I think you'll understand our			caution.

The emissary is			aboard a class eight probe.	Surprised reactions from the group.					RIKER			A class eight probe is just over			two meters long!					PICARD				(thinking)			True, Number One. But if the			sensors and transmitters were			removed and life-support			installed, there would be just			enough space for one person.					RIKER			And those probes are designed to			go warp nine.        STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/10/89 - ACT ONE        9.8    CONTINUED:					DATA				(nods)			By sending the probe to meet us			rather than diverting the			Enterprise to the starbase, they			have saved us six point one hours.					PICARD			Obviously Starfleet feels that			time is of the essence.					RIKER			Yes, but still... to seal someone			up inside a Class Eight Probe and			then just launch it off...				(shakes his head)			Hell of a way to transport a			Federation dignitary.					PICARD				(to Clancey)			We'll need an intercept course			with pin-point accuracy. The			probe carrying the emissary has			no means of navigation...					RIKER				(finishing the thought)			... so if we don't catch it on the			first try, we'll have to chase			it.9    EXT.

There are four			colonies in the Boradis system,			and nine other outposts scattered			throughout the sector.	Geordi turns to Picard.					GEORDI			Captain, we have a way to save			you some time.					PICARD			Proceed.					O'BRIEN			I believe we can beam the probe			aboard while we're still			travelling at Warp Nine.					RIKER				(a low whistle)			Quite a trick.					GEORDI			Right -- at warp speed it's			nearly impossible to get a solid			transporter lock. But if we			caught the probe with a tractor			beam...					RIKER				(catching on)			We could use the tractor beam to			focus the transporter.					GEORDI			Exactly.					PICARD			Risks?					GEORDI			None to the emissary. There's			a chance the probe could break			free... then we'd have to find			it and start over.       STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/10/89 - ACT ONE       11.10   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			So it's a gamble.				(a beat)			Odds, gentlemen?					GEORDI			Twenty to one it'll work.	O'Brien nods agreement.
