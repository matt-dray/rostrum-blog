TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	As TRANSPORTER EFFECT MATERIALIZES the Visitors.	KOSINSKI has the look of someone operating at top	performance. His ASSISTANT, a humanoid alien, is small,	physically non-threatening, with a way of allowing	himself to blend into the background in a shy,	good-natured way. Kosinski dominates the room. He's	obsessed with himself and what he does. His manner is	arrogant, his demeanor authoritarian; he pulls every	eye toward him.	Riker is with LT. COMMANDER ARGYLE, chief engineer,	a rough-edged, hearty man for whom the Enterprise	engines are the alpha and omega of his existence.	Counselor Troi holds back, observing.					RIKER			Welcome aboard, Mister Kosinski.			I'm the first officer, Commander			William Riker.

MAIN ENGINEERING	A dramatic HIGH ANGLE as Kosinski, his assistant, Riker,	and Argyle ENTER the area. There are some members of	the duty watch there -- as well as Wesley, who's working	on a school-related science project.					KOSINSKI			Inform the bridge I shall begin			the first test in precisely fifty			minutes. Why is that child here?					ARGYLE				(throws off the answer)			He's working on a school project.				(that's not what's on				 his mind)			Before you continue, there are			some questions. First, tell us...	Riker ENTERS SHOT, but stands slightly off to one side,	properly allowing Argyle to handle this, but ready to	support him where necessary.6    EMPHASIZING KOSINSKI	He turns and faces them. (While this discussion plays	out, Kosinski's assistant -- who remains uninvolved --	has become attracted to Wesley's project and steps over	beside the young man. This is a small thing which	should go almost unnoticed.)					KOSINSKI				(interrupting)			... To save myself time, let me			ask those questions for you.	Kosinski's arrogance builds with every word. He moves	around as he talks, like a prize fighter, circling,	jabbing, -- softening the opponent.					KOSINSKI				(continuing)			You received the information which			Starfleet provided -- you fed it			into your computer -- being as			precise as humanly possible -- then			you ran a controlled test. And,			then, to your astonishment --			nothing happened.      STAR TREK: "Where None... " -- 7/30/87 -- ACT ONE      8.7    EMPHASIZING RIKER AND ARGYLE	They are irritated by Kosinski's arrogance, yet it's	strangely reassuring. This self-assurance, coupled with	his record of success, makes them begin to think what	he proposes is possible.					KOSINSKI			So you said - "What's going on?			This doesn't work. Kosinski's			a fraud."8    ANGLE ON KOSINSKI	He steps closer for emphasis.					KOSINSKI				(smiles smugly)			You see, I have had this			discussion on other Starfleet			vessels. They didn't understand			it; why should you?	Cutting through the rhetoric.					ARGYLE			You are surely not saying it's			unexplainable?					KOSINSKI			I'm saying I'm not a teacher, and			don't want to become one. I have			neither the inclination nor time.					RIKER			You have all the time you need.					KOSINSKI			I don't think you understand.			This has already been approved			by Starfleet Command.					RIKER			But it hasn't been approved by			the chief engineer... or by me.					KOSINSKI				(a little snidely)			I didn't know that was necessary.					RIKER			Now you do.      STAR TREK: "Where None... " -- 7/30/87 -- ACT ONE      9.8    CONTINUED:					KOSINSKI			Perhaps I should talk with Captain			Picard.					RIKER			If you like, but it won't change			anything.	Kosinski sees the resolve in Riker's eyes and knows he	can't bully his way through this.					KOSINSKI			How basic shall I be?	Riker, without softening his expression in the	slightest, indicates with a wave that it's Kosinski's	call.					RIKER			I leave that to you.	Kosinski steps over to the computer. Everyone moves	a little closer, including Wesley. Kosinski's assistant	comes up next to the young man.9    EMPHASIZING KOSINSKI (OPTICAL)	He gestures his assistant over to sit at an adjacent,	secondary computer keyboard. Then the assistant works	rapidly at this keyboard.					KOSINSKI			We can save a little time this			way. My assistant is laying in			my base formulas a bit more			rapidly than a human can do it...				(small chuckle)			... even myself.	Wesley is closely watching which keys the assistant is	using and what is appearing on the computer screen.10   COMPUTER SCREEN (OPTICAL)	It is a three-dimensional geometric display which builds	and grows as WE WATCH, becoming a wonderfully complex	and incredibly beautiful pattern. It is nothing we	recognize nor understand. It is a theoretical	representation of warp power.     STAR TREK: "Where None... " -- 7/30/87 -- ACT ONE     10.10   CONTINUED:					KOSINSKI			Here is, in the simplest possible			terms, what I do. This warp drive			system was tuned only in the			grossest sense, at least to my			standard anyway. What I do is			specific.	Kosinski waves his assistant back, addresses his primary	keyboard now and taps on a few keys. There is a slight	change.					KOSINSKI				(continuing)			How should I say this?				(finds the words)			Aah... sufficient to say for now,			these symbols and their			relationships have greater meaning			to me than to you...	He taps on the keys again, and again there is a slight	change.					KOSINSKI				(continuing)			... although you can in time learn			them. Then, those of you			sufficiently gifted, can duplicate			my results.					RIKER			But the three percent efficiency			increase of the other vessels			could still have been caused by			other things such as simply			working more carefully, better			station coordination...					ARGYLE			And you mention "gifted." In			what way? Whatever any of us can			learn to do on a computer, another			computer can eventually perform			faster, more precisely...					KOSINSKI			Wrong! What the computer can't			do is create. Only the mind...				(taps his forehead)			... is capable of true, original			thought.     STAR TREK: "Where None... " -- 7/30/87 -- ACT ONE     11.10   CONTINUED: (2)	Kosinski steps away from the computer. Riker and Argyle	follow him a few steps, then stop.					RIKER			But what we're dealing with is			mechanics. However complex it			may be, it has to do with an			engine.					KOSINSKI			And that is exactly where you go			wrong. Warp drive has become so			complex that it is...11   ANGLE EMPHASIZING RIKER AND ARGYLE	exchanging a puzzled look as:					KOSINSKI			... as filled with mysteries as			nature itself.				(indicates)			If you'll view the screen with			me and consider the following.12   EMPHASIZING WESLEY (OPTICAL)	Drawn by curiosity, he moves closer to the computer	screen. The assistant, curious over the expressions	playing over Wesley's face, moves in beside him. In	b.g. Kosinski is touching a button or so on the keyboard	which produces minor changes on the screen as he	continues.					KOSINSKI			Is this merely "mechanics" or is			it nature that we deal with in			this? What else than nature are			elementals like space and time?	Wesley looks puzzled as though some information on the	screen is out of place.     STAR TREK: "Where None...
