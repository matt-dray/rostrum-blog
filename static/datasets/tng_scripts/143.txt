SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Cruises at warp speed as we hear:					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 42723.8.			The Enterprise is en route to the			Epsilon Nine Sector for			astronomical survey of a new			pulsar cluster. In the meantime,			Ensign Crusher will be diverting			to Starbase five one five for			progressive Starfleet exams...2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - THE TURBOLIFT DOORS	open and WESLEY enters the bridge, where RIKER, DATA,	and WORF are at their usual stations, supernumeraries	filling in as needed. Wesley steps up to Riker, who	hands him a Starfleet communications rectangle.					RIKER			This just came in from Starfleet--					WESLEY				(taking the disk)			The testing parameters?	Data steps up to them:					DATA			Do not be apprehensive. I found			the Academy examinations quite			elementary.					WESLEY			You would.       STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Your earlier test results were			good enough to get you Academy			credit for your work here. I			don't think you have anything to			worry about.					WESLEY			But those Academy cadets are			pretty competitive, you know.					RIKER			They don't have your practical			experience, Wes.					DATA			Commander Riker is correct. While			the information imparted to cadets			at the Academy is unquestionably			vital for prospective Starfleet			officers, it nevertheless requires			a significant period of			supplementary systems training			and situational disciplines.					RIKER			Data... isn't that what I just			said?					DATA			Yes, Commander. But not quite			as perspicuously.	Riker and Wesley react to that as we GO TO:3    INT. SICKBAY/PULASKI'S OFFICE - PICARD	paces in front of PULASKI, obviously being evasive:					PICARD			I won't have you telling me what			course to set!					PULASKI			As chief medical officer, I am			ordering you to report to Starbase			five one five immediately!					PICARD			Oh, please. I feel fine.       STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - TEASER       3.3    CONTINUED:					PULASKI			The truth is, you've neglected			this far too long.					PICARD			This ship has a mission to carry			out.					PULASKI			An astronomical survey to be			conducted by the science officers,			I believe.					PICARD			I've been looking forward to			seeing the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster			for myself.					PULASKI			Then we'll perform the procedure			right here.					PICARD			Absolutely not.					PULASKI			My staff and I are perfectly			capable of giving you the			replacement.					PICARD			That's not the point. Not only			am I in splendid health, but it			would be inappropriate for you			to perform the procedure.					PULASKI			Why Captain Picard, I had no idea.			You do have an ego, don't you?					PICARD			Clarify.					PULASKI			You're concerned about your image.					PICARD			I never said that.       STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - TEASER       4.3    CONTINUED: (2)					PULASKI			Don't worry. Get yourself down			to Starbase five one five and your			image will be safe with me.	He reacts to that, exiting as we GO TO:4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - THE TURBOLIFT DOORS	open and Picard steps out, nearly bumping into Wesley	who was about to enter the turbolift:					WESLEY			Captain... excuse me.					PICARD			I understand you're heading for			Starbase five one five.					WESLEY			Yes, sir. I was just on my way			to Shuttle Bay Two.					PICARD			Good. I have some business of			my own there. I shall accompany.			you.	Wesley reacts, eyes widening, his voice cracking:					WESLEY			You will?				(then, composing				 himself)			I mean, yessir!					PICARD			Prepare the shuttle for immediate			departure.					WESLEY			Aye, sir.	Wesley exits via the turbolift; Riker reacts to all of	this, steps up to Picard.					RIKER			Is there something I can take care			of for you at Starbase			five one five?       STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - TEASER       5.4    CONTINUED:					PICARD			I'm afraid not, Number One.					RIKER			But you'll miss the Epsilon Pulsar			survey.					PICARD			I'm very well aware of that. You			have the bridge. Carry on.	With that, Picard turns and exits into the Ready Room.	Riker considers all of this, shares a concerned glance	with the other bridge officers and then follows Picard	into the Ready Room as we GO TO:4A   INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD	turns to face Riker, as the door slides shut behind	them:					PICARD			What is it, Number One?					RIKER			Is something wrong? This trip			to Starbase five one five seems			rather unexpected.	Picard smiles awkwardly, goes about the business of	picking up some reading material for his journey:					PICARD			Not to worry. Ensign Crusher and			I will rendezvous with you on your			return from the Epsilon Pulsar			Cluster.					RIKER			Forgive my saying so, sir, but			you're being rather enigmatic.					PICARD			Consider it captain's privilege.					RIKER			As first officer, I have complete			security clearance--       STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - TEASER       6.4A   CONTINUED:					PICARD			This has nothing to do with ship's			business.				(then, with a sigh)			Suffice it to say that this is			strictly a matter of ...vanity.	Picard heads for the door with his books and exits as	we GO TO:5    INT. CORRIDOR - GEORDI	is on his way to Engineering with SONYA, walking with	Wesley, who is obviously worried about something:					GEORDI			Starbase five one five's not			exactly around the corner, Wes.			You have quite a trip ahead of			you.					WESLEY			Yeah. I know.					GEORDI			Relax. You'll do fine on your			exams.					WESLEY			It's not the exams I'm worried			about. It's Captain Picard.					SONYA			Why? He's not taking the exams.					WESLEY			He's coming with me to starbase.			Just the two of us. Nearly a			six-hour transit. What am I going			to talk to him about for six			hours?					SONYA			Archaeology...semantics...			literature... art... you can learn			a lot from Captain Picard.	Just then, Picard approaches:       STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - TEASER       7.5    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Nice day for a little trip,			Captain?					PICARD			Hardly.	Picard and Wesley head off down another corridor as	Geordi and Sonya react to Picard's mood as we GO TO:5A   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	comes out of warp, decelerating to impulse speed while6    OMITTED7    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DATA	is in his "Ops" chair as he hears:					PICARD (V.O.)			Shuttle Number Two ready for			departure.					DATA			We are at impulse speed and you			are cleared for departure.8    EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)	the shuttle exits the Shuttle Bay.9    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL) - RIKER	enters from the Ready Room, looking up at the	viewscreen now to see the shuttle streaking away. He	crosses to Data:					RIKER			Data... wasn't the captain looking			forward to this mission to the			Epsilon Pulsar Cluster?					DATA			So he had said.       STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - TEASER       8.9    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Then what would make him change			his mind? Why would he leave the			ship now?	Data reacts to that, exchanging a concerned glance with	Riker. Suddenly, Worf pipes up with:					WORF			Receiving a Mayday on all			frequencies, sir!					RIKER			Source?					WORF			Rhomboid Dronegar Sector			zero-zero-six--					RIKER			Detail.					WORF			Ship...unidentified...distress.			Nothing more.					RIKER			Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar			zero-zero-six at warp seven.	Data looks to Riker, quietly concerned:					DATA			Sir... Rhomboid Dronegar sector			will put us at considerable			distance from Captain Picard.					RIKER			I know, Data. I know.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE       9.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:9A   EXT.

THE BRIDGE - RIKER	rises now:					RIKER			Viewer.	Data taps his console appropriately and11   THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	comes alive with the image of an unusual alien ship.	Hardly aerodynamic, this craft appears to be something	of a throwback when contrasted to the Enterprise. It's	dead in the water. Riker approaches the screen,	curious while Worf remains cautious:      STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE      10.11   CONTINUED:					WORF			Deploy shields, sir?					RIKER			Hold fast.				(then)			Data?					DATA				(re: the ship)			Basic early design capable of			sub-light travel only.					WORF			Commander, we are being hailed.					RIKER			On screen.	The VIEWSCREEN image glitches for a split-second and	then comes alive with the interior of the Pakled ship.	It looks like an analog throwback to the late twenty-first	century. A number of slothful, droopy-eyed humanoids	appear to be working with great confusion on some	engineering control panels in the b.g., as their	commander, GREBNEDLOG, steps into foreground.					RIKER			I am First Officer William Riker.			This is the USS Enterprise,			responding to your distress			signal--	Grebnedlog arches his massive brow, his eyes opening	just a bit wider as he responds with typically wistful	Pakled hypoplastic speech, almost a sense of hopeful	longing in their every word:					GREBNEDLOG			Uh-hunh.	Riker exchanges a curious glance with Data, then back	to screen:					RIKER			What is your problem?					GREBNEDLOG			We are far from home.      STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE      11.11   CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			So are we, but you sent out a			Mayday--					GREBNEDLOG			Uh-hunh					RIKER			Do you need help?					GREBNEDLOG			We are Pakleds. Our ship is the			Mondor.				(re the work in the				 b.g.)			It is broken.	Riker sighs impatiently, turns to Data:					DATA			Sensors indicate engineering			problems.					RIKER			Lieutentant La Forge to bridge...					DATA			They have experienced total			guidance system failure and they			have less than twenty-four hours' reserve			power.					RIKER				(to viewscreen)			What brings you so far from home?					GREBNEDLOG				(wistfully)			We look for things.					RIKER			What were you looking for?					GREBNEDLOG			Things we need.					RIKER			Can you be more specific?					GREBNEDLOG			Uh-hunh.      STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE      12.11   CONTINUED: (3)					RIKER			Then please do so.					GREBNEDLOG			Things that make us go. We need			help.	In the b.g., the turbolift doors open and Geordi steps	onto the bridge, spots the viewscreen. He looks at the	Pakleds, grins wryly:					GEORDI			Let me guess: their rubber band			broke, right?					RIKER				(to viewscreen)			What is the nature of your			mission?					GREBNEDLOG				(nodding slowly)			We look for things.					RIKER				(aside; to Data)			Do you hear an echo?				(then, back to				 viewscreen)			Understood. Our chief engineer			will beam aboard to help you--				(to Worf)			Out.	Geordi reacts to that as all eyes turn toward him:					GEORDI			Wait a minute... me?	And as Riker pats him reassuringly on the back, Worf	turns from his station, concern etched all over his	Klingon countenance:					WORF				(re: the viewscreen)			Do we truly need to send our chief			engineer over to them?					RIKER			They obviously need our help.      STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE      13.11   CONTINUED: (4)					WORF			Why do we not simply give them			the information they need to make			their repairs?					RIKER			Do you honestly think they could			handle our technical			specifications?					WORF			We don't know that much about			them. I urge caution.					RIKER			Acknowledged, Worf... but we have			an obligation to render aid.				(turns to Geordi).			Report to the Transporter Room			with all necessary gear.					GEORDI			Aye, sir.	With that, Geordi exits. Worf remains concerned, leans	in to Riker with:					WORF			We need more information.	Riker turns to Data:					RIKER			Do you have anything else on them?					DATA			They are a relatively benign			species.					RIKER			Don't they seem a little... slow?					DATA			They may merely have			poorly-developed language skills.	Worf leans in with:					WORF			What about weapons?      STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE      14.11   CONTINUED: (5)					DATA			Our scan shows very limited			armaments.					RIKER			I think we can relax, Worf. They			can't even get their ship moving			without our help, and we certainly			have them outmanned and outgunned.	Worf can't argue with that as we GO TO:12   EXT. SPACE - PICARD'S SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)	hurtling past us at impulse speed while:13   INT. THE SHUTTLE - WESLEY	handles the controls with confidence and aplomb.	Picard checks the instruments with a scowl:					PICARD			E.t.a. thirteen-thirty hours.					WESLEY			Not exactly warp speed, sir.					PICARD			More like a late twenty-second century			interplanetary journey.					WESLEY			Sir?					PICARD			You should read more history,			Ensign.					WESLEY			Yes sir.					PICARD				(mumbling to himself)			Complete waste of time...					WESLEY			Pardon, sir?      STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE      15.13   CONTINUED:					PICARD			I shouldn't be taking this trip			at all. I belong back on the			Enterprise.					WESLEY			Why are you going with me to			Starbase five one five, Captain?					PICARD				(snappish)			It's certainly not my idea!	Wesley reacts, afraid to probe further. Picard glances	over at:					PICARD				(continuing)			I'm sorry. I don't mean to take			it out on you.				(then)			I just hate going through another			damned cardiac replacement.					WESLEY			Cardiac replacement? I didn't			know...					PICARD			Now you do.					WESLEY			A parthenogenetic implant?					PICARD			What else would it be?				(then, a bit softer)			My own heart was injured and a			replacement was necessary. That			would have been it except that			the replacement is flawed and must			now be put right.					WESLEY			Why would anyone use a flawed			replacement?	Picard ices over at that, glaring out at the stars	ahead now:					PICARD			Just pilot the shuttle, Ensign.	And on Picard's obdurate countenance, we GO TO:      STAR TREK: "Samaritan Snare" - 3/8/89 - ACT ONE      16.14   EXT.
