BEVERLY'S QUARTERS	A few minutes later. Beverly is packing as Guinan	looks on. Beverly is still very agitated. She keeps	moving from the closet to the suitcase, messily	stuffing clothing into the suitcase. Her tone is	sarcastic and bitter.					BEVERLY				(rapid)			Three days on the shuttle to			Starbase twenty-three... then a			transport back to Earth... I can			hear Admiral Brooks now, telling			me how I've disgraced Starfleet			Medical...				(beat)			Then a leisurely day and a half			before the formal inquiry begins			and my career ends.					GUINAN				(calm)			Beverly.	Beverly looks at her.					GUINAN			My elbow.					BEVERLY			Your elbow... ?	Guinan lifts her elbow to remind Beverly. Beverly	takes a breath, stuffs whatever she's holding into her	bag.					BEVERLY			Alright, let me see it...	Guinan sits in a chair as Beverly examines her arm,	moving it gently back and forth. Guinan winces	slightly.					BEVERLY			Does that hurt?        STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - 02/25/93 - ACT ONE        4A.4    CONTINUED:					GUINAN			Yeah, right there...	Beverly nods.					BEVERLY			Tennis elbow, alright. Hold it			like this...	Beverly positions Guinan's arm, then moves to a nearby	medical kit, brings it over and opens it up. She takes	out a small medical device.					GUINAN			I've never been to a formal			inquiry.					BEVERLY			It's no big thing. Any doctor can			have one... all you have to do is			disobey orders... violate medical			ethics... cause an interstellar			incident...					GUINAN			That would do it, all right.					BEVERLY				(beat)			Make a fist.	Guinan makes a fist. Beverly continues to treat her	arm.					GUINAN			Do I have to break my leg before			you tell me what happened?	Beverly takes a breath... tries to collect her	scattered thoughts.					BEVERLY			It started when I invited those			scientists on board...				(beat)			No. It started at the Altine			Consortium.				(beat)			Actually, it probably started			before that. When I began			feeling... comfortable.	Beverly is so agitated she's rambling, disconnected.	Guinan is forced to become a knitter of thoughts.     STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - REV. 02/26/93 - ACT ONE     4B.4    CONTINUED: (2)					GUINAN			Comfortable?					BEVERLY			Too comfortable.					GUINAN			Ah.					BEVERLY				(nods)			That's why I went to the Altine			Conference... to hear the latest			bio-physical theories. Maybe find			a new area of research. And			that's where I met Doctor Reyga...			nobody would listen to him -- just			because he was a Ferengi. They			all but jeered him off the			stage...	Guinan is trying to fit all the pieces together.					GUINAN			So you invited the scientists on			board... to listen to this Doctor			Reyga...	Guinan's ability to fill in the blanks prods Beverly to	open up more.					BEVERLY			I thought I could be a...			facilitator. You see, he had this			amazing invention, based on			metaphasic field technology. But			his methodology was completely			unorthodox.					GUINAN			That's my favorite kind.					BEVERLY			I thought... if I could bring			scientists from various cultures			aboard the Enterprise... sit them			down... help them understand the			value of his ideas... well, it			seemed like the right thing to do.     STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - REV. 02/26/93 - ACT ONE     4C.4    CONTINUED: (3)					GUINAN			Sort of a scientific diplomat.					BEVERLY			That's it exactly. And believe			me, it wasn't easy.	Beverly puts down her medical device and begins pacing.					BEVERLY			I had to persuade Captain			Picard... and then I had to round			up as many scientists as I could			in the field of subspace			technology...                                             BEGIN FLASHBACK:      STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - REV. 03/01/93 - ACT ONE      5.5    INT. SCIENCE LAB	A laboratory with a number of consoles, monitors, etc.	The various scientists are there, sitting and standing,	as Beverly's V.O. continues.					BEVERLY (V.O.)			... but of all the scientists I			invited, only four were interested			in hearing about Doctor Reyga's			invention.	The scientists are: a male Ferengi, REYGA; a female	Klingon, KURAK; a female Vulcan, T'PAN and her human	husband, DOCTOR CHRISTOPHER; and a male Takaran (a new	alien), JO'BRIL. They're in the midst of a long	discussion. The discussion continues under (NOTE:	Added dialogue found at end of script) as the CAMERA	PANS around the table with Beverly's V.O. introducing	each character.	On Kurak:					BEVERLY (V.O.)			Kurak was a warp field specialist			on the Klingon Homeworld. I don't			think Klingons regard scientists			very highly... she always seemed			a little defensive.	On T'Pan and Christopher:					BEVERLY (V.O.)			Doctor T'Pan is practically a			legend in the field of subspace			morphology. She's been the			director of the Vulcan Science			Academy for fifteen years...				(beat)			Her husband, Doctor Christopher,			came with her... I didn't know			much about him... but he was some			kind of a subspace theoretician.	On Jo'Bril:					BEVERLY (V.O.)			Jo'Bril was a Takaran... the first			one I'd ever met. I had no idea			what to expect from him.      STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - REV. 03/01/93 - ACT ONE      6.5    CONTINUED:	On Reyga:					BEVERLY (V.O.)			And then there was Doctor Reyga...			the Ferengi scientist.					REYGA			You've all seen my experimental			data. The metaphasic shield has			been proven.					T'PAN			Forgive my skepticism, Doctor, but			your claims are somewhat			extravagant. Protect a shuttle			within a star's corona? Not even			your own government believes it			can be done.	Reyga bridles at the implication but stays calm. He is	not the typical volatile, argumentative Ferengi;	rather, he projects an air of dignity and integrity.					BEVERLY			That's why I've asked you all to			come here. I think you have the			vision to see the potential in			Doctor Reyga's metaphasic shield.	Beverly is her composed, capable self on the surface...	but underneath, she has the mild anxiety of someone	engaged in a pursuit not wholly familiar. Her task --	to help make a Ferengi scientist credible -- is not an	easy one.					REYGA			I need help to develop the shield.			I am willing to grant exclusive			rights to whoever provides the			necessary resources.	There is a small silence at this. Clearly some of the	scientists don't feel this is a thrilling proposal.	Beverly looks around the room... tries to stimulate	some response.					BEVERLY			I think you all realize what this			shielding process would mean...			the possibilities for exploration			and research are endless...      STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - REV. 02/26/93 - ACT ONE      7.5    CONTINUED: (2)					KURAK			But only if it works.				(to Reyga)			I'm not convinced this metaphasic			shield can withstand either the			temperature or the radiation it			would be exposed to.					REYGA			But it has -- not only in			countless simulations, but in a			field test that I conducted			myself.					KURAK			For which, of course, we have only			your word...					REYGA			Are you accusing me of falsifying			my data?					KURAK				(shrugs)			You wouldn't be the first			scientist to manipulate			experimental data to his own			advantage...					BEVERLY				(leaping in to diffuse				 this)			Doctor Reyga has offered to			demonstrate his invention. He's			outfitted one of our shuttles with			the metaphasic shield.					REYGA			I will take it into the corona of			the star Vaytan.					CHRISTOPHER			That star has a superdense corona.			The shuttle would be subjected to			particularly intense radiation.			Perhaps it would be wise to choose			a star of lesser magnitude.					T'PAN			I agree. My own research into			solar energy transfer suggests			that Vaytan's corona is extremely			unstable.      STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - REV. 03/03/93 - ACT ONE      8.5    CONTINUED: (3)					REYGA				(mildly)			What better way to test my			invention? I'm not concerned --			the shield will hold.					KURAK			I, for one, would feel more			comfortable if someone else flew			the shuttle. Someone more --			objective.					JO'BRIL			I will volunteer for that task.	All heads turn toward Jo'Bril. These are the first	words he has uttered.					JO'BRIL			I've spent years studying solar			plasma reactions. The thought of			being able to penetrate a star's			corona... it's a remarkable			opportunity.				(to Reyga)			I've studied your data. I think			you're on solid scientific ground.					KURAK			I don't share your optimism,			Doctor Jo'Bril... but if you wish			to pilot the craft, I would be			more confident about your			assessment of the shield... than			Doctor Reyga's.					CHRISTOPHER			I agree. At this point, we need			an impartial evaluation.	Beverly is a little concerned -- this is an unexpected	development.					BEVERLY			We'd want to be sure that you're			familiar with the shuttle			controls... and Doctor Reyga's			modifications...					JO'BRIL				(waving this off)			I'm an accomplished pilot. It			will be no problem.     STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - REV. 03/03/93 - ACT ONE     8A.5    CONTINUED: (4)					BEVERLY			Well...				(to Reyga)			What do you think?	To Reyga, this is a godsend -- someone believes in him.      STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - REV. 03/02/93 - ACT ONE      9.5    CONTINUED: (4)					REYGA			Doctor Jo'Bril... I am gratified.			And there will be no difficulty			operating the metaphasic controls --			the system will activate			automatically as you approach the			star.	Beverly looks around the room... feeling pleased...	this has gone even better than she'd expected.					BEVERLY			Well, then. We'll proceed with			the demonstration at fifteen			hundred hours. We'll meet on the			Bridge.	The group breaks up and files out the door. Reyga	stays behind with Beverly, gathering PADDS into his	case.					BEVERLY			I think that went well, don't you?					REYGA			Thanks to you, Doctor.					BEVERLY			I didn't do anything...	They move toward the door and EXIT.6    INT. CORRIDOR	as they continue walking.					REYGA			This is an opportunity I would			never have had without you, and I			promise you I'll never forget it.					BEVERLY			Some of those scientists are still			a little doubtful... but after the			demonstration I'm sure they'll			come around.        STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - 02/25/93 - ACT ONE        10.6    CONTINUED:					REYGA			If there's anything I'm used to --			it's skepticism.				(small laugh)			After all -- a Ferengi scientist			is almost a contradiction in			terms.	She starts to protest, but he raises a hand.					REYGA			No, don't deny it. I know how the			Ferengi are regarded...					BEVERLY			I'd still expect the scientific			community to be more open-minded			than they seem to be.					REYGA			The metaphasic shield is a			breakthrough in technology... many			scientists have tried to develop			it. It's only natural there would			be some... resistance...					BEVERLY			You mean jealousy.				(shakes her head)			I know. I wondered if that might			account for Doctor T'Pan's			attitude. She's been working on			subspace shielding technology for			years. And you've beaten her to			the punch.					REYGA			I'm really not interested in			competition. All I want is to be			acknowledged... respected as a			scientist. This invention will			finally do that.	Beverly smiles and they walk on down the corridor	together.					BEVERLY (V.O.)			As far as I was concerned, the			hard part was over. I'd stepped			out on a limb... and it hadn't			broken.     STAR TREK: "Suspicions" - REV. 03/01/93 - ACT ONE     11.7    INT.
