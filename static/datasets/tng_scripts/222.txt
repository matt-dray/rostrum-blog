CLARA'S QUARTERS	CLARA SUTTER, a seven-year-old girl, and TROI sit at a	table set for tea. The settings include a place for	Clara's imaginary friend, Isabella. Troi is chatting	with Clara...					CLARA			I like to cook all kinds of stuff.			Like yogurt and raisin salad...			chocolate-chip pancakes... and			purple omelettes.					TROI			Purple omelettes?					CLARA				(nods)			You put grape juice in the eggs.			Isabella doesn't like it very much			-- she says it tastes funny.					TROI			I can see her point...	Troi picks up a cup full of sugar cubes.					TROI			Sugar with your tea?					CLARA			Yes, please.	Troi serves a sugar cube into Clara's tea. Then she	turns to address an empty chair where "Isabella" is	sitting. It becomes clear that Isabella is Clara's	invisible friend.					TROI			Isabella... would you like some			too?	Clara leans toward Isabella's seat, and listens	carefully to words only she can hear. After a moment,	she turns to Troi.    STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - REV. 2/25/92 - TEASER    2.1    CONTINUED:					CLARA			Yes. But she takes two cubes.	Troi serves the sugar.					TROI			I'll bet Isabella is very pretty.	Clara is enthusiastic about Isabella.					CLARA			She's very, very pretty. She has			blonde hair and a blue dress with			white buttons. Her ears are			pierced. And she's tall.					TROI			Maybe you could draw me a picture.			I'd love to see what she looks			like.	Clara frowns.					CLARA			You don't think she's real.					TROI			I think she's real for you, Clara.			And that's real enough for me.	Clara seems happy with the response. Troi looks across	the room at Clara's father, DANIEL SUTTER -- who has	been watching the entire time. Her look says that the	session is over.					SUTTER				(to Clara)			Honey, I think it's time for you			to go. You don't want to keep			Keiko waiting.					CLARA				(to Troi)			I have to go plant the nasturtiums			now.				(matter of fact)			I'm Keiko's helper in the			arboretum today.					TROI			Is that so?      STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - 2/24/92 - TEASER      3.1    CONTINUED: (2)					SUTTER				(to Clara)			Go ahead, Sweetie. Be home for			dinner.					TROI			I hope to see you soon, Clara.			Maybe we can be friends.	Clara likes the idea.					CLARA			Okay.	Clara stands, carefully pulls out the chair for	Isabella, and heads for the door. She stops at the	door, "hearing" something that Isabella is saying. She	listens... then turns to Troi.					CLARA			Counselor Troi?					TROI			Yes?					CLARA			Isabella says she likes you.	Troi looks to Isabella.					TROI			Thank you, Isabella.	Clara smiles, then EXITS. Sutter takes a seat next to	Troi. He looks concerned about his daughter. Troi	tries to reassure him.					TROI			I understand why you're			concerned... but you have nothing			to worry about. It's a normal,			healthy activity for children to			engage in imaginary play.	Sutter is relieved.					SUTTER			I'm just afraid she's not making			real friends. She spends all of			her time with "Isabella"...	Troi considers.      STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - 2/24/92 - TEASER      4.1    CONTINUED: (3)					TROI			You've been moving from starship			to starship since Clara was two			years old. Maybe Isabella			provides a constant companion for			Clara. She knows this is one			friend she won't have to leave			behind.	Sutter nods.					SUTTER			You're probably right.					TROI			Give Clara a chance. As she			learns to make friends on the			Enterprise, she'll probably move			away from her imaginary world.	Sutter offers Troi a grateful smile...2    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	on the outskirts of a large NEBULA -- a glowing expanse	of swirling red clouds, with a bright point of light	deep in its center.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 45852.1.			The Enterprise has arrived at			FGC-four-seven -- a nebula which			has formed around a neutron star.			We are eager to investigate this			unique formation.3    INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, ENSIGN FELTON and VARIOUS	NDS at stations. GEORDI is at an aft science station.	Everyone watches the main viewscreen, which displays	the nebula -- a rare and special sight.    STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - REV. 2/28/92 - TEASER    5.3    CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(off console)			We've got elevated quantities of			hydrogen... helium... trionium...			but nothing the shields can't			handle.					RIKER			Shields up.					PICARD			Take us in, Ensign. One-quarter			impulse.					ENSIGN FELTON			Aye, sir.	Ensign Felton works the controls...4    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it enters the nebula. Suddenly, from within a	nearby cloud -- a tiny POINT OF LIGHT appears. The	light FLARES briefly as it passes through the ship's	shield bubble... then it ENTERS through the hull of the	ship...5    OMITTED5A   INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)	As small section of the ceiling GLOWS briefly with	a red color, and a POINT OF LIGHT emerges into the	corridor (as seen in the nebula). The light pauses,	then zips around a corner and out of view. Clearly	a life-form is now on board...5B   ANOTHER CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)	The POINT OF LIGHT comes into view -- right behind Data	and Geordi, who are walking briskly down the corridor,	on their way to engineering, talking TECH...					DATA			In order to complete the scheduled			observations, the lateral sensors			will require additional processing			time.   STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - REV. 3/02/92 - TEASER   5A.5B   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			We could steal a couple of hours			while they're recalibrating the			thermal interferometery scanner.					DATA			Will a couple of hours be enough			time to complete the			high-resolution series on the			neutron star?					GEORDI			No problem. We'll just double			up the main sensor bandwidth.	Data and Geordi continue walking -- the light flies off	down another corridor...    STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - REV. 2/26/92 - TEASER    6.6    INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)	BEVERLY and NURSE OGAWA are working at a medical	station, mid-conversation. During this scene, out of	their view, a small section of the wall GLOWS with a	red color, and the point of LIGHT emerges into the	room. The light flits about, as if watching Beverly	and Ogawa from afar...					BEVERLY			After dinner, then what?					OGAWA			We went to the holodeck and took			a walk on the Champs Elysees...	Beverly reacts to the console.					BEVERLY			The neural scanner still seems			a bit off. Let's check the sensor			calibration...					OGAWA			I'll run a diagnostic...	They work for a beat.					BEVERLY			And... ?					OGAWA			And?					BEVERLY			After Paris... ?					OGAWA			He has shore leave next month.			He asked me to go to Risa with			him.					BEVERLY			No problem. Nurse Davila can			cover for you.					OGAWA			I don't know if I'm going, Doctor.			I hear it's a very uninhibited			atmosphere. Personally, I don't			think I'm ready for that kind of			"fun."   STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - REV. 2/26/92 - TEASER   6A.6A   CLOSE ON POINT OF LIGHT (OPTICAL)	as it zips into a nearby hypospray, causing it to GLOW	for an instant. After a beat, the light exits the	hypospray and zips into a nearby tricorder, which	glows... and into another medical tool -- all in quick	succession. The light is exploring its environment.	Over which we HEAR --					BEVERLY (o.s.)			Try to talk him into Telana Minor			instead -- they've got a cruise			down the Jokri River... the			iridescent currents are beautiful.	The light flies away and EXITS through the nearest	wall...7    OMITTED8    INT. ARBORETUM (OPTICAL)	Lush and beautiful (as seen in "Data's Day".) A	section of the wall GLOWS red -- the POINT OF LIGHT	zips into a nearby gardening tool... then EXITS...9    OMITTED10   ON A FLOWER (OPTICAL)	The light enters an exotic-looking flower, causing the	flower to GLOW -- but this glow is different, longer	and more intense. The glow vanishes and a duplicate	flower appears next to the original. Just as quickly,	the duplicate flower disappears into a tiny red dot,	which instantly DEMATERIALIZES...11   ANGLE - CLARA (OPTICAL)	The glowing pinpoint of light MATERIALIZES again and	stops, as if spotting Clara. It hovers, as if watching	her from afar...11A  CLOSE ON CLARA (OPTICAL)	She is by herself, kneeling on a patch of dirt among	the trees and bushes. As she plants seeds into the	soil, she talks to her imaginary friend Isabella...   STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - REV. 2/26/92 - TEASER   6B.11A  CONTINUED:					CLARA			See, Isabella... you have to push			your finger into the soil as deep			as you can.	Clara picks up a watering container, and waters the	seeds.					CLARA			The baby seeds are very small...			so we mustn't give them too much			to drink.	Clara sets down the water, and begins to pat down the	soil with her hands. She hums a nursery rhyme as she	works, obviously enjoying her day at the arboretum...	Then, with out warning, the point of light flies	directly into Clara's head -- Clara's head GLOWS, as if	the light is scanning her mind (same glow effect as	the flower). The red light PULSES like it did in the	flower -- then vanishes. Clara doesn't notice a thing.	She keeps humming her song...	Slowly, another girl's VOICE starts to hum along with	Clara. Clara stops, looks around.					CLARA			Hello? Is somebody there?	Suddenly, behind Clara, a figure steps into view. It's	a young girl, slightly taller than Clara, and a few	years older (she should appear to be around twelve).	This is ISABELLA. She has blonde hair and wears a blue	dress with white buttons. She looks exactly as Clara	described her -- and yet, there is something alien and	spooky about the girl. She doesn't smile... and her	face is expressionless, cold...					ISABELLA				(to Clara)			Hello.	Clara whips around and sees Isabella -- she reacts,	wide-eyed with astonishment.					CLARA			Isabella?	The other girl, Isabella, studies Clara.					ISABELLA			Hello, Clara.   STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - REV. 2/26/92 - TEASER   6C.11A  CONTINUED: (2)	OFF Clara's utter surprise...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                            STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - REV. 2/25/92 - ACT ONE  7-9.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            12   INT. ARBORETUM	As before. Clara facing Isabella, confused by the	sight -- after all, she's never actually seen her	imaginary friend.					CLARA			Isabella... How come I can see			you?	Isabella is expressionless.					ISABELLA			Is something wrong with the way			I look?					CLARA			No. I've just never seen you			before. Not for real.					ISABELLA			Well... now you can see me for			real. Doesn't that make you			happy?					CLARA			Yes... it's wonderful!	Isabella glances where Clara was planting seeds.					ISABELLA			Can we go now?					CLARA			We should finish planting the			seeds.					ISABELLA			I'm tired of planting. Let's do			something else.					CLARA			Like what?     STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - 2/24/92 - ACT ONE     10.12   CONTINUED:					ISABELLA			Like...				(pointedly)			I would really like to explore			the ship.					CLARA			We should finish planting first.			I promised Keiko.					ISABELLA			We can finish later. Let's go			look around.	Isabella moves to Clara and takes her by the hand.	Clara stands up, hesitant.					CLARA			I'd better ask my daddy.					ISABELLA			Your daddy won't mind. We can			tell him later. Come on...	Isabella tugs Clara along -- big sister leading younger	sister. She's persuasive, more sophisticated than	Clara. There is an intelligence at work here. This is	no ordinary "imaginary friend." Isabella is hard to	deny -- Clara smiles and goes along. As they EXIT hand	in hand...13   INT. ENGINEERING	Geordi, Data and Sutter working at various consoles,	collecting data from the nebula. N.D.s as needed.	Geordi's console displays a GRAPHIC of the nebula.					GEORDI			So what are we going to name this			nebula? "FGC-four-seven" just			doesn't have a nice ring to it.     STAR TREK: "Imaginary Friend" - 2/24/92 - ACT ONE     11.13   CONTINUED:					SUTTER				(with humor)			Why don't we call it... "Sutter's			Cloud?"	Data works his console.					DATA			The rotational period of the			neutron star is one point three			five seconds.					GEORDI			That's a bit on the long side.			Sutter -- let's see if we can get			a reading on the particle flux.					SUTTER			Aye, sir.	Sutter works his console.					GEORDI			I was thinking more along the			lines of "The La Forge Nebula."			Sounds sort of majestic, don't			you think?					DATA			Based on those selections, I would			prefer FGC-four-seven.	Geordi and Sutter laugh. Data misses the joke.	Suddenly, the ship TREMBLES slightly, and the lights	FLICKER. Reactions.					SUTTER			What was that?					GEORDI			It felt like we hit something.	Data checks a console.					DATA			Shields have registered an impact.			But the sensors show nothing in			the vicinity.14   INT.
