PICARD and	RIKER are standing nearby, WORF is at Tactical, and	ENSIGN RAGER is at Con. The monitor at the science	station shows an Okudagram of a subspace radio wave.					DATA				(working)			I have identified the signal,			Captain. It is from the U.S.S.			Jenolan, a Federation transport			ship reported missing in this			sector seventy-five years ago.	Riker looks at the monitor.					RIKER			Code one alpha zero.

Picard, Riker, & Data move toward their	stations.					PICARD			Report.					WORF			We have entered a massive			gravitational field.	They all react with surprise.					DATA				(works)			There are no stars or other			stellar bodies listed on our			navigational charts. However,			sensors indicate the presence of			an extremely strong gravitational			source in this vicinity.					PICARD				(to Worf)			Can you localize the source of			the gravity field?	Worf works his console.          STAR TREK: "Relics" - REV. 8/5/92 - TEASER 3-3A.             3    INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	The viewer displays a starfield with a large dark ball	at the center. At this distance, it appears as smooth	as a billiard ball, but because it is so dark it's hard	to discern anything else.	Everyone is mystified by this strange object.					RIKER			Sensors?					DATA			I am having difficulty scanning			the object. However, it would			appear to be approximately two			hundred million kilometers in			diameter.	Picard and Riker react with astonishment.					RIKER			That's nearly the size of Earth's			orbit around the sun.					PICARD			Why didn't we detect it before			now?					DATA			The object's enormous mass is			causing a great deal of			gravimetric interference. That			might have prevented our sensors			from detecting the object before			we dropped out of warp.	A beat as they all look at this strange object on the	screen. Suddenly, a look of wonder comes across	Picard's face... he might have found something hitherto	only imagined.					PICARD			Mister Data, could this be a...			Dyson Sphere?					DATA				(thinks)			This object does fit the general			parameters of Dyson's theory.					RIKER			A Dyson Sphere?           STAR TREK: "Relics" - 8/4/92 - TEASER           3A.3    CONTINUED:					DATA				(thinks)			There is no comparative data,			Captain.

I'm not surprised you			haven't heard of it. A twentieth			century physicist, Freeman Dyson,			postulated that an enormous hollow			sphere could be constructed around			a star. This would have the			advantage of harnessing all the			radiant energy of the star. A			population living on the interior			surface would therefore have a			virtually inexhaustible source			of power.					RIKER			Are you saying there might be			people living in there?					DATA			Possibly a great number of people,			Commander. The interior surface			area of a sphere this size would			be equivalent to more than two			hundred fifty million class M			planets.					WORF			Sir. I have located the distress			signal. It is coming from a point			on the northern hemisphere.	Picard thinks for a beat.					PICARD			Ensign Rager, take us into			synchronous orbit above that			position.	Rager works.                                             CUT TO:4    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE & SPHERE (OPTICAL)	The ship is nearing the Sphere. At this range, the	monstrous object looks like a giant WALL in space,	which stretches o.c. Where before, the sphere appeared	perfectly smooth, we can now make out intricate	patterns on the surface suggesting construction	supports, but again we're too far away to make out	anything distinct.         STAR TREK: "Relics" - REV. 8/6/92 - TEASER         5.5    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	As before. Everyone watching the viewscreen.					RAGER			We are holding relative position			at thirty thousand kilometers			above the surface.					DATA				(off console)			I have found the Jenolan,			Captain. It has impacted on the			surface of the sphere.				(works)			There are no life signs.			However, there are several small			power emanations... and life			support is still functioning at			minimal levels.	Riker looks to Picard, who thinks for a moment... then	nods.					RIKER				(to com)			Bridge to Engineering. Geordi,			meet me in Transporter Room Three.				(to Worf, on the move)			Mister Worf.	Worf and Riker EXIT.5A   EXT. SPACE - THE JENOLAN (OPTICAL)	The transport ship has made a crash landing on the	surface of the sphere. There should be some damage	visible, but not so much that the ship would be	incapable of later flight.6    INT. JENOLAN (OPTICAL)	The Ops center is fairly small with a modest command	area at one end and an engineering console at the	opposite end. Off to one side is a two-man Transporter	stage and control panel. The ship's technology and	design should be noticeably older than the Enterprise	and should reflect outdated engineering methods and	philosophy.           STAR TREK: "Relics" - 8/4/92 - TEASER           5A.6    CONTINUED:	The lights are DIM and there doesn't seem to be any	equipment working at present. One or two of the	consoles are damaged or burnt out, and the bulkheads	look smashed and broken.	Riker, Worf, and GEORDI MATERIALIZE.

JENOLAN OPS CENTER	Continuous action from the Teaser. Riker and Geordi	are staring at Scott on the Transporter stage. Scott	looks a little woozy... unsure of his bearings, then	he seems to shake it off and he moves toward them with	a plan of action. His left arm is in a sling and he	has one or two cuts and bruises visible.					SCOTT			Thank you, Lads.	He quickly steps to the Transporter console and they	make room for him.					SCOTT				(working on console)			We've got to get Franklin out of			there.					GEORDI			Someone else's pattern is still			in the buffer?					SCOTT			Aye.

There is a N.D. TRANSPORTER	TECHNICIAN at the controls. Scott is fascinated by	everything he sees here... like a kid in a new and	unimagined candy shop. The other three step off the	platform, but Scott stays behind and looks up at the	overhead Transporter machinery.					RIKER				(on the move toward the				 door)			We should probably get you to			Sickbay.

He pulls off the covering panel	and scrutinizes the interior. Geordi is a little	concerned, but doesn't stop him as Scott pokes around.					SCOTT				(shocked)			What have ye done to the duotronic			enhancers?					GEORDI			Those were replaced with isolinear			chips about forty years ago. It's			a lot more efficient now.	Scott begins to reach in and move something, but	Geordi stops him.					GEORDI			Uh... be careful there. That's			an EPS power tap.					SCOTT			Ah.	Geordi closes the panel and then gestures to the doors	as they head for the corridor.					GEORDI				(on the move)			You were saying earlier that you			were on your way to the Norpin			Colony when you had a warp engine			failure...	They EXIT to the Corridor.11   INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS	Scott and Geordi ENTER from Transporter Room and head	down the corridor. Scott's eyes are continually	scanning every inch of the corridor. Occasionally he	stops to examine something.        STAR TREK: "Relics" - REV. 8/7/92 - ACT ONE        11A.11   CONTINUED:					SCOTT				(on the move)			That's right. We had an overload			in one of the plasma transfer			conduits.

An actual Dyson Sphere.			Can you imagine the engineering			skills needed to even design such			a structure...					GEORDI			I know... it's pretty amazing.			What happened when you first			approached it?	They move down the corridor toward a Turbolift.					SCOTT			We began a standard survey of the			surface. We were just completing			the initial orbital scan when our			aft power coils suddenly exploded.			The ship got caught in the			sphere's gravity well... and down			we went.           STAR TREK: "Relics" - 8/4/92 - ACT ONE           13.11   CONTINUED: (3)	Scott's face clouds over a little as he recalls the	crash.					SCOTT			Franklin and I were the only ones			to survive the crash...					GEORDI			What made you think of using the			Transporter pattern buffer to stay			alive?					SCOTT			We didna have enough supplies to			wait for a rescue... so I had to			think of something.					GEORDI			But locking it into a diagnostic			cycle to keep the signal from			degrading... and cross connecting			the phase inducers to provide			a regenerative power source...			it's brilliant.					SCOTT				(sadly)			I'm afraid it was only fifty			percent brilliant... Ensign			Franklin deserved better.	Geordi tries to shift the subject back to something	Scott can get excited about.					GEORDI			I think you're going to like the			twenty-fourth century, Mister			Scott. We've made some pretty			incredible advances in the last			eighty years.	This does perk Scott up a little as they ENTER the	Turbolift.					SCOTT				(looks around)			Aye... from what I can see you've			got a fine ship here, Mister La			Forge... a real beauty. In fact,			I must admit to being a little			overwhelmed.          STAR TREK: "Relics" - 8/4/92 - ACT ONE          13A.11   CONTINUED: (4)					GEORDI			Wait until you see the Holodeck.	Scott reacts as the doors CLOSE on them.                                             CUT TO:           STAR TREK: "Relics" - 8/4/92 - ACT ONE           14.12   INT.

CORRIDOR	Scott and Geordi are walking toward the shuttlebay.	For once, Scott is listening to Geordi tell a tall tale	and they're both in good spirits.					GEORDI			So, this alien space 'baby'--			which was about the size of a			four-story building -- really			thought the Enterprise was its			mother.					SCOTT			You're pulling an old man's leg.					GEORDI			No, really.

Scott is	surprised by what he sees.65   NEW ANGLE	Revealing Picard, Riker, Worf, Beverly, Troi, and Data	all standing next to a LARGE SHUTTLECRAFT. Scott is	stunned as he looks over the gleaming ship.					SCOTT				(shocked)			You're giving me one of your			shuttles?					PICARD			Call it... an extended loan.			Since you lost your ship while			saving ours, it seemed only fair.					RIKER				(re: shuttle)			It's not much to look at...					SCOTT			Lad, every woman has her own			charms... ye just have to know			where to look.               STAR TREK: "Relics" - 8/4/92 - ACT FIVE             62A.65   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			It's a little slow, but it'll get			you to the Norpin colony... if			that's really where you want to			go.	Scott looks at the ship... and we see a change come	over his features... he seems rejuvenated. Scott turns	to Geordi and smiles broadly.               STAR TREK: "Relics" - 8/4/92 - ACT FIVE              63.65   CONTINUED: (2)					SCOTT			The Norpin Colony is where old			men go to retire... maybe I'll			end up there someday... but not			just yet.					PICARD				(holds out hand)			Bon voyage, Mister Scott.					SCOTT			Thank you, sir. For everything.	Everyone says goodbye and Scott shakes hands with	several of them before he and Geordi move off to the	shuttle for a final moment. Scott glances back at the	others.					SCOTT			They're a good crew.					GEORDI			Yeah.	Scott looks around the shuttlebay.					SCOTT			And she's a fine ship... a credit			to her name.				(beat)			But I've always found that a ship			is only as good as the Engineer			who takes care of her... and from			what I can see... the Enterprise			is in good hands.	There's a moment between the two of them... they shake	hands... and Scott gets into the shuttle.66   EXT.
