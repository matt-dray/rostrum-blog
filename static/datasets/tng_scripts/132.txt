SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship glides through space, planets and stars.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 42411.2.			The Enterprise has been			unexpectedly diverted to the			Ramatis star system. The two			sides of a bitter little planetary			conflict have petitioned Starfleet			to transport to their world a			mediator they have mutually			selected. Our orders are			transportation only -- no			interference, no responsibilities.			It is a mission much to my			liking.2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	RIKER has the Command position. WESLEY has the Conn,	DATA is at Ops, n.d. CREWMEMBER at Tactical. The other	positions are occupied by n.d. crewmembers.					RIKER			Reduce to half impulse.					WESLEY			Reducing velocity to one-half			impulse.	Riker walks to the captain's Ready Room door.	The CHIME signals Riker's presence. From inside,	CAPTAIN PICARD calls out.					PICARD (O.S.)			Come.	The door opens.     STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - TEASER     2.3    INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM (OPTICAL)	Riker enters. Spread across and above Picard's desk is	a complicated arrangement of three-dimensional shapes -- some	on the surface, others seemingly suspended in	air.					PICARD			Ah, Number One. Look at this.			Ever since we left the Lima-Sierra			system, I have been puzzling over			how the third planet could			maintain such an orbit, when it			is theoretically impossible, but			consider this.	Riker moves closer, whereupon Picard activates the	display. The shapes GO INTO MOTION. They then STOP.					RIKER			There's no degeneration?					PICARD			Exactly!					RIKER			Why?					PICARD			I haven't got that worked out.					RIKER			Perhaps this facsimile lacks mass.					PICARD			Yes, somewhat, but if this is an			accurate representation -- would			it not explain what happened in			that system?	Riker moves closer.					RIKER				(as he studies the				 display)			Perhaps.	Picard comes back to business.					PICARD			Well, not a matter of great moment -- just			a knot I had to untie.			Now... What was it you wanted to			see me about?     STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - TEASER     3.3    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Captain, we have arrived at			Ramatis Three.	Picard gets to his feet as he speaks:					PICARD			Ah -- well -- time to leave.4    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	entering orbit near the silver and blue planet of	Ramatis Three.5    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	as before. Picard and Riker come onto the bridge.					RIKER			Standard orbit, Mister Crusher.					WESLEY			Standard orbit.	Together they head for the turbolift.					RIKER			Data, you have the bridge.	Data leaves Ops and is immediately replaced by an n.d.	FEMALE CREWMEMBER. He takes the Command position.6    ANOTHER ANGLE	as Riker and Picard enter the turbolift, the doors	close.7    INT. TURBOLIFT					RIKER			I am still uncomfortable about			your leading this away team.     STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - TEASER     4.7    CONTINUED:					PICARD			This is not an away team in the			strictest sense. I consider this			more of a ceremonial function.			For me not to go, could be			construed a lack of respect, or			that I do not regard the mission			as significant. Transporter Room			Five.	The turbolift heads for Deck Seventeen.					RIKER			Considering the importance of this			mission and the lives which are			at stake... I don't want to do			anything which would have a			negative affect on this			negotiation, however...					PICARD			I appreciate your concern, Number			One, but, I'm sure it will go			quite smoothly.					RIKER			We have come a great distance for			this mediator.					PICARD			They asked for the best and that			person, from all reports, is Riva.	The turbolift arrives. Riker and Picard step off.7A   INT. CORRIDOR	as they walk along.					RIKER			I've never heard of him.					PICARD			I'm not surprised, he hasn't			mediated for several decades.					RIKER			That's a long time to be out of			the saddle. Let's hope he's not			rusty.     STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - TEASER     5.7A   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Yes, for all our sakes... let's			hope Riva is at the top of his			game.	They turn and enter the Transporter Room.8    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	TROI and WORF are waiting. They step onto the	platform.					TRANSPORTER CHIEF			Coordinates have been input.					PICARD			Very good, Lieutenant. Worry not,			Number One -- this will be a simple			ceremonial greeting, and right			back to the Enterprise.					RIKER			I'm sure.					PICARD			Energize.	And the away team -- with Picard as their leader -- VANISHES.9    INT. RAMATIS - ANTEROOM (OPTICAL)	as the away team STACKS UP.10   ANOTHER ANGLE - INT. RAMATIS - ANTEROOM	A handsome BOY greets the away team, and motions for	them to follow him.11   ANOTHER ANGLE	as they reach a vestibule which leads to a larger room.	The boy leads them toward a larger room.     STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - TEASER     6.12   INT. LARGER ROOM	They enter. There is no one in the room. At the far	end is a raised dais. The design of the room is	geometric -- the decorations eclectic. As the away team	looks around, they realize their young guide has	disappeared and they are all alone:	Off their reactions:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE     7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:13   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around the planet Ramatis.14   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Riker once again has the Command position.					RIKER			Captain, this is the Enterprise.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			We have arrived safely, Number			One, and for the most part, we've			been ignored... ah...15thru	OMITTED1617   INT. RAMATIS - LARGER ROOM	The away team in the larger room.					PICARD			... some of the local citizenry			are beginning to assemble. I'll			keep you informed.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			I would appreciate it.18   ANOTHER ANGLE - LARGER ROOM	Slowly, without any apparent signal, HUMANOIDS begin to	casually assemble. They enter the room from portals,	scattered along the walls, talking quietly among	themselves in an unrecognizable, and mostly unheard,	language.19   ANOTHER ANGLE	There are three of them... each a distinctive	personality and physical archetype -- the	SCHOLAR/ARTIST, the WARRIOR/ADONIS, a CULTURED WOMAN.	These "types" show no emotion, and if they are aware of	the away team, they do not acknowledge them.     STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE     8.20   ANOTHER ANGLE	a MAN enters from behind the away team. By his dress,	his carriage and his presence he is someone in	authority. This is RIVA -- he appears to be around	thirty earth years, pleasant looking, with an open	friendly countenance.21   PICARD AND TROI	as Riva passes them. He pauses, studying first Picard -- his	appraisal is open, his gaze penetrating. Because	of his vast experience in different and unusual	situations, Picard has the wisdom to wait for Riva to	make the first move. Riva then turns his attention	on Worf, then to Troi, then leaves her with a warm	flirtatious smile.					TROI				(she responds with a				 smile, and a nod)			Riva.22   ANOTHER ANGLE - ROOM	Riva walks onto the dais, those he passes offer a	greeting.					WARRIOR/ADONIS			eeennniYOO.	It is obviously a term of respect as well as a	greeting. Riva responds with a slight wave of his	hand.					TROI			He is a well-liked leader. Their			affection is genuine, as is his.					PICARD			Well, if they respect him on			Solais, as much as they do here -- we			could be looking forward to			a successful mission.23   ANOTHER ANGLE	Riva takes his place on the dais, the CHORUS gathers in	front of him. Riva pauses, comfortable -- relaxed -- very	pleasant. His expression is bemused -- as though	he is expecting good news.     STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE     9.23   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Counselor?					TROI			I've never seen anything like this			before and I'm a little uncertain			about how to proceed.				(smiles)			There is a wonderful feeling of			well being, emanating from here.	The man on the dais, makes a very slight motion --	(through all this the Chorus never turns to face Riva.	Their method of communication we do not understand and	will never understand. It is part of their long	history.)					WOMAN			Please -- come closer.	The away team takes a couple of steps closer.					WOMAN				(continuing)			Before I start, is there anything			you need? Refreshments, food.					PICARD			No. But thank you for asking.					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			Then --				(with a gesture to				 Picard)			Proceed.	Picard hesitates - then...					PICARD			Greetings from the United			Federation of Planets. I am			Captain Jean-Luc Picard, of the			USS Enterprise. This is Counselor			Troi, and Lieutenant Worf.	Riva remains impassive. He again studies the away	team. Then he makes a slight MOVE with HIS HANDS. And	the Chorus SPEAKS.					WARRIOR/ADONIS			GREETINGS!    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE    10.23   CONTINUED: (2)					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			Welcome to Ramatis.					WOMAN			I have been expecting you.	The away team is surprised.	The Warrior/Adonis member of the Chorus, takes a step	closer to Troi, and gives her a blinding smile.					WARRIOR/ADONIS			You're empathic.					TROI			Yes.					WARRIOR/ADONIS			Then, although you already know			my feelings toward you, allow			me to put them into words. I			am looking forward to this			journey, now more than ever,			because it gives me the chance			to spend time in your company.	Warrior/Adonis smiles, then all expression leaves his	face.					TROI				(she speaks to Riva,				 not Warrior/Adonis)			I am flattered. And I too, look			forward to learning more about			you.24   PICARD	He looks the Chorus over, then turns to Troi for	advice.					TROI				(quietly to Picard)			There's a very different kind of			communication here, Captain.					PICARD			Yes, so I see. I think there are			facets to Riva about which we were			not informed.    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE    11.24   CONTINUED:					WOMAN			Precisely. It is a process which			has developed over the centuries			and one I find quite harmonious.					PICARD			So Riva the famous mediator is... ?					WARRIOR/ADONIS			Deaf.				(with great conviction)			Born, and hope to die.					PICARD				(indicating Chorus)			And you all speak for Riva?					CHORUS			Yes.					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			I not only convey his words, but			his emotional intent as well.					TROI			The members of the Chorus, serve			as "translators," and each			represents the archetypes of man's			personality.					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			I am the scholar. I represent			the intellect. I speak in			matters of judgment -- philosophy -- logic.			Also, I am -- the dreamer.			The part which longs to see the			beauty beyond the truth which is			always the first duty of art.			I am the poet...	Riva makes a slight movement and the Scholar/Artist --	shuts up and steps back.    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE    12.24   CONTINUED: (2)					WARRIOR/ADONIS			Artists tend to ramble, they live			too much in the future, they			neglect the moment. I am Riva's			libido. I am his passion. I am			the anarchy of lust. The romantic -- the				(with a little				 self-deprecating nod				 to Troi)			... lover. Also, I am as he.				(indicates Worf)			The definition of Riva's honor...			the perfect line which never			wavers.					PICARD				(to the Woman)			And you...					WOMAN			I represent that part of Riva			which binds all the others			together. I am harmony -- wisdom -- balance.					PICARD				(to the Woman)			Remarkable. How did this...	Riva flashes anger.					WARRIOR/ADONIS			Speak to me!	The away team is surprised by the outburst. Worf	instinctively steps forward.					PICARD			What?!	Again Riva gestures aggressively.					WARRIOR/ADONIS			Speak directly to me!					TROI				(so Riva cannot read				 her lips)			He's prodding you to get a			reaction.    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE    13.24   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD				(to Riva)			The uniqueness of this			presentation provoked my			inadvertent breach in protocol.			No insult was intended.					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			Then... none is perceived.					PICARD			I was curious about how this			unique form of communication came			about.					WOMAN			The gene for hearing is not			present in our planet's ruling			line.					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			Not that unusual, indeed it is			similar to the English Tudor			monarchs of your planet Earth,			all who had hemophilia. Or the			leaders of Fendaus Five, who were			without limbs.					WARRIOR/ADONIS			Throughout time, many of the			galaxy's greatest contributors			have been similarly "special."					PICARD				(to Riva)			Your ability to read lips -- is			very impressive.					WOMAN			Thank you.					PICARD			Your "translators" do not see you,			yet they are able to accurately			convey your thoughts.    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE    14.24   CONTINUED: (4)					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			My Chorus is so attuned -- they			can "hear" my hands and translate			to you. It is a relationship			which has developed over centuries -- their			ancestors provided the			same service to my ancestors.					TROI			Your way of communication is most			distinctive, Riva.	The Warrior/Adonis shifts his place on the steps,	closer to her.					WARRIOR/ADONIS			It takes a fine mind to appreciate			that, Counselor Troi.					TROI				(indicates				 Warrior/Adonis)			This part of you does not seem			to speak very often.	Riva's eyes dance in flirtation.					WARRIOR/ADONIS			Only when the spirit moves me.	His gaze is intense, very male. Troi lowers her eyes.					PICARD			Riva -- if you are ready -- the			situation at Solais Five is very			critical. We should not delay.					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			I will prepare for departure			immediately.					PICARD			Are you all -- I mean -- Riva, did			you plan to take these people with			you?					WARRIOR/ADONIS				(challenging)			Is that a problem?    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE    15.24   CONTINUED: (5)					PICARD			No, it's just that we didn't know			you would all be coming.	Riva descends the steps, toward Troi.					WARRIOR/ADONIS				(to Troi)			How long will my journey to			Solais take?					TROI			More than two of your days.					WARRIOR/ADONIS				(Riva comes up and				 beside them)			Then, until duty calls, this will			indeed be a pleasant trip.25   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	The away team, now including Riva and his Chorus, move	slightly to the side. Worf touches his communicator.					WORF			With your permission, Captain.					PICARD			Make it so.					WORF			Enterprise, this is the away team,			seven to beam up.	Riva, the Chorus, and the away team BEAM UP to the	Enterprise.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                              STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO    16.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:26   EXT.

Riker is anxious to get underway, and relieved	when he hears:					TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE			The away team, plus four, is on			board.					RIKER			Acknowledged. Ensign, set your			course for Solais Five.	Wesley inputs the coordinates.					WESLEY			Course is set.					RIKER			Velocity -- warp eight.					WESLEY			Warp eight -- aye.					RIKER			Engage, Mister Crusher.					WESLEY			Yes, sir.28   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	stretches into warp.29   ANOTHER ANGLE - MAIN BRIDGE	The turbolift opens, Picard leads the others onto the	bridge. Worf goes immediately to his position. Riker	stands, ready to greet his guest.    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO    17.30   ANGLE ON THE AWAY TEAM AND RIVA	They enter, cross to Riker. Picard begins the	introductions.					PICARD			Riva, may I present--					RIKER				(indicating the Chorus)			What's this?					PICARD			These three -- speak for Riva.	Riker also reacts with surprise.					RIKER			You mean, the most respected			negotiator in the Federation -- is			deaf? Amazing.					SCHCLAR/ARTIST				(to Picard)			First, Captain, let me say that			it is an honor to be on board such			a fine vessel.				(continuing)			Now... please continue with the			introductions.					PICARD			This is my first officer,			Commander Riker.					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			It is an honor to meet you.					PICARD			Lieutenant Commander Data.	Riva looks Data up and down. Then smiles.					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			It is a pleasure to meet such a			unique individual.					DATA			Thank you...	Riva responds with a nod.    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO    18.30   CONTINUED:					PICARD			And our chief medical officer,			Katherine Pulaski.					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			Doctor.					PICARD			This is Lieutenant La Forge.					GEORDI			Pleased to meet you, sir.	Riva touches his VISOR gently.					WOMAN			What is that you're wearing?					GEORDI			A VISOR. It modifies the			electromagnetic spectrum and			carries the readings to my brain.					WOMAN			And without it, can you see?					GEORDI			No. Without it I'm as blind as			a post.					WOMAN			Your VISOR serves the same purpose			as my Chorus, which "hears" my			thoughts and translates them into			sound.					GEORDI			Yes.					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			And you don't resent it?					GEORDI			The VISOR or being blind?					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			Either.    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO    19.30   CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			They are both part of me, and			since I like who I am, why would			I resent either being blind or			wearing the VISOR?					SCHOLAR/ARTIST			What is your position on this			ship?					GEORDI			Engineering officer, sir.	Riva feels a kinship with Geordi and it shows in his	movements. He puts a friendly hand on Geordi's	shoulder.					WOMAN				(to Geordi)			It's a blessing to understand we			are special...				(then including				 everyone)			... each in his own way.					GEORDI			My feeling exactly.					WOMAN			Please call me Riva.					GEORDI			Okay.

I can imagine what it			would be like to lose my VISOR.			But... we'll find something.			Don't give up.	Troi cocks her head, reading Riva, it makes her sad.					TROI			Too late. I think he already has.	No interpretation necessary for the sign Riva makes.	He has given up.63   INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM	The CHIME SOUNDS.					PICARD			Come.	Troi enters.					PICARD			How is our mediator?					TROI			The same. Unreachable.	Picard's face is etched with concern.					PICARD			What can we do to help him?					TROI			I can't do anything. It's up to			him. Confidence is faith in			oneself, it can't be given by			another.	Picard takes a long moment to absorb this, then nods.    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR    46.63   CONTINUED:					PICARD			You're right, of course.	Troi leans across the table, puts her hand over his.	The CHIME SOUNDS again.					PICARD				(continuing)			Come.	Data enters.					DATA			Captain, I have reviewed and			stored five distinct signing			languages.64   ANGLE ON DATA	He turns to demonstrate his new ability.					DATA			This is blue. This is a blue			ocean. This is a blue ocean at			sunset. This is two people			walking along the beach by a blue			ocean at sunset. This is two			happy people in love walking along			the beach by a blue ocean at			sunset. This is --	He'd go on forever if someone didn't say --					PICARD			Enough!				(beat)			Let's talk to Riva.65   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Picard, Data, Troi, and Riva.					PICARD			Good news. Data has learned your			language. He can translate for			you at the summit.	Data repeats Riva's signed reply.    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR    47.65   CONTINUED:					DATA				(translating)			It will not work. I need my			words.	Riva responds sharply.					DATA				(continuing;				 translating)			There -- that is what I mean. Your			translation is literal. You say			words. I do not need just words -- I			need nuance, and subtlety...			the shadings my Chorus enable me			to communicate.					PICARD			But your ability is unchanged.			All that's different is the method			of transmission.	Riva's body language says it all.					DATA				(translating)			No! I cannot!	Troi situates herself behind Picard.					TROI				(softly)			It's not working. Go another			direction.	Picard's expression changes. Body language becomes	forceful, angry.					PICARD			Data can understand you. Use him			as your Chorus. Let him express			your words.					DATA				(translating)			No -- it is not the same thing.			Data is unacceptable...					PICARD			You've got to take advantage of			what you've got...    STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR    48.65   CONTINUED: (2)	Riva looks at him for a moment.					DATA				(translating)			What I have got. I have got			nothing. Do you not understand - I			cannot do it.					PICARD			You're right. Maybe you are all			show.	Riva's eyes flash in anger.					PICARD				(continuing)			You hide behind your Chorus.				(in his face)			You're a fake.66   CLOSER ON PICARD AND RIVA	Riva takes a threatening step towards Picard. Catches	himself, signs with a smirk.					DATA				(translating)			You are attempting to provoke me.	Picard nods, hopeful.					DATA				(continuing;				 translating)			It is not going to work.67   ANGLE ON PICARD	Disappointed.					PICARD			That's too bad. A lot of people			are going to die.68   ANGLE ON RIVA	in complete turmoil. Bolts from the room.        STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR        49.69   PICARD	He pauses for a moment. Then gets up:					PICARD			Data.	The android rises, then he and Picard exit in pursuit	of Riva.70   INT. GUEST QUARTERS	Picard finds Riva. He gently touches Riva's shoulder.	Riva turns -- he tries weakly to smile.					PICARD			We will return you to Ramatis.	Riva nods -- resigned -- very disappointed.					PICARD				(continuing)			... but, first I am going to			attempt to settle the conflict			on Solais.	Riva signs -- Data interprets:					DATA				(translating)			You.					PICARD			We have come this far -- it would			be difficult for me personally			to leave without making the			attempt.					DATA				(translating)			It could be dangerous.	Picard nods.					PICARD			Help me.	Throughout this exchange, Riva's mood will begin to	lighten. As he communicates with Picard, the very act	of self-expression slowly restores his self-esteem.        STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR        50.70   CONTINUED:					DATA				(translating)			How?	Picard is driving this in a specific direction.					PICARD			We all earn our reputations.			Yours is that of a very successful			negotiator -- a mediator.					DATA				(translating)			And you want to know the trick.					PICARD			If there is one - yes.					DATA				(translating)			Captain, there is no secret. What			I do is help one person -- one			group -- express themselves to the			other.					PICARD			Simple enough to say - difficult			to accomplish.					DATA				(translating)			The real trick is getting them			to listen. To understand. To			turn a disadvantage to an			advantage.					PICARD			Then why can't you turn your			disadvantage into an advantage?	Riva studies Picard for a long moment. Then a smile	comes to his face.					DATA				(translating)			That is an interesting thought...				(to Picard)			I do not understand -- what thought			is he referring to?	Riva stands. He reaches out and shakes Picard's hand.        STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR        51.70   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA				(continuing,				 translating)			Thank you.					PICARD			I will contact those down on the			planet. Tell them to prepare to			begin discussions immediately.	Off Data's reaction:									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                                 STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE        52.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:71   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around Solais Five.72   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Riva is there with Picard and Data, both of whom are	carrying phasers.					PICARD			Set phasers on stun.	Data and Picard check their weapons, then:					PICARD				(continuing)			Energize.	They BEAM OUT.73   EXT. SOLARI PLANET (OPTICAL)	Picard, Riva, and Data MATERIALIZE onto the flattened	mountain top... Riva will sign and Data will	interpret. Data does not have to sign because Riva,	after all, can read lips.	Riva looks around the area, then signs to Data.					DATA				(speaking for Riva)			Could you relight the torches,			to let them know that I am back.73A  PICARD	He moves to the nearest torch and relights it. Then	gazes for a moment out over the battlefield.73B  SCENE	Data has lighted another of the torches and is walking	toward the third. Riva moves to the middle of the	flattened area.        STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE        53.73B  CONTINUED:					DATA				(continuing to speak				 for Riva)			I would like the table right here.					PICARD				(to Data)			Make it so.					DATA				(touching his				 communicator)			Main Engineering, this is			Commander Data.74   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - ANGLE ON GEORDI					GEORDI			Go ahead, Data.					DATA'S COM VOICE			You can beam the table down now.75   EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP (OPTICAL)	Riva is very relaxed. His confidence is back.					PICARD			It could be a while before the			emissaries arrive. They will be			more cautious after the last			incident.					DATA				(speaking for Riva)			You can leave whenever you choose.			I will get a message out when I			am ready to leave.				(to Picard as Data)			Captain -- I do not understand what			is going on here? Without his			interpreters, how can he mediate?	The table MATERIALIZES while they talk.					PICARD			Riva is going to teach them sign			language.	Riva steps forward.        STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE        54.75   CONTINUED:					DATA				(speaking for Riva)			Yes -- it is turning a disadvantage			into an advantage. Learning how			to sign will actually become part			of the process of them learning			how to live together in peace.					PICARD			As they learn how to communicate			with Riva, they will be learning			to communicate with each other.					DATA				(speaking for Riva)			... and that is the first and most			important step in any			relationship.				(to Picard as Data)			Captain, although it took me only			moments to learn sign language,			it will take them months.					PICARD			Time well spent.					DATA				(speaking for Riva)			These people have been fighting			all their lives, they know only			hatred, suspicion, fear. Even			with my Chorus -- I could not have			changed those attitudes in a day.			We have a chance, and they want			the talks to be successful or they			would not have called me.	Riva steps over to the table and sits down.75A  PICARD AND DATA (OPTICAL)	They move off to the side.					PICARD			Enterprise -- two to beam up.				(to Riva)			Good luck.					DATA				(translating for Riva)			And to you.        STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE        55.75A  CONTINUED:	Picard and Data DISAPPEAR in the TRANSPORTER BEAM.	Leaving Riva all alone on the empty mountain top - waiting.76   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around Solais Five.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 42111.8.			Personal comment. I am confident			that Riva can help the Solari			achieve a lasting peace. We will			deliver his Chorus to Starbase			Seven-One-Three so they can be			returned to Ramatis.77   INT.

Just be what			we are.				(beat)			There's only one Geordi La Forge.			And I wouldn't want to run my ship			without him.	A big grin spreads across Geordi's face.					GEORDI			All right!				(more controlled)			I mean, thank you sir.					PICARD			Dismissed.	Picard watches with a bemused, paternal expression as	Geordi exits.80   OMITTED81   INT. SICKBAY	Geordi's in the examining chair.					PULASKI			Optic nerve laser welding. A			difficult operation. It might			not work. But if it did, it would			open up a whole world for you.        STAR TREK: "Loud as a Whisper" - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE        57.82   CLOSE ON GEORDI	He takes off his VISOR. Eyes exposed, face full of	fear and hope.					GEORDI			I'll think about it.83   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	The bridge crew in their positions. Business as usual.					RIKER			Set course, two-two-four, mark,			three-nine.					WORF			What is our destination?					PICARD			Alpha Delta Beta.
