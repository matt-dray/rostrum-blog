I'll be right there.	Picard stands and heads for the Observation Lounge	door.3    OMITTED4    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Picard ENTERS from the Bridge -- his attention is	immediately riveted toward an OBJECT on the middle of	the table. It is a TERRA-COTTA FIGURINE, roundish,	about a foot wide and tall, of vaguely HUMANOID shape,	with a serene look on its face -- like some alien	Buddha. Its surface is worn, it looks ancient.	Picard is stunned to see it.					PICARD			My God...5    INCLUDE RIKER AND PROFESSOR RICHARD GALEN	PROFESSOR GALEN is in his sixties, tall, slender, greyhaired,	and seems to emanate dignity and intelligence.	Riker has a smile on his face.					GALEN			Then you can identify this object,			Mister Picard.	Picard is taken aback by the man's face and voice.					PICARD			Professor Galen.         STAR TREK: "The Chase" - 02/04/93 - TEASER         3.5    CONTINUED:					GALEN				(lightly)			I suppose I should say -- Captain			Picard.	Picard glances toward Riker.					RIKER				(explains)			Professor Galen hailed me from his			shuttle an hour ago. He suggested			that we surprise you.					GALEN			To clarify... I insisted and your			First Officer was kind enough to			accommodate me. I hope I haven't			been overly presumptuous...				(beat)			My star pupil now being master of			the stars...	Picard brushes it off with a wave of his hand.					PICARD			No one is more welcome on my ship.	He turns again to the figurine on the table.					PICARD				(continuing)			I never thought I would see a			Kurlan naiskos.				(to Galen)			Fifth Dynasty?					GALEN			Is that your conclusion, Mister			Picard.				(catching himself)			Forgive me again, Captain.					PICARD			Please. "Mister" will do just			fine.	Riker reacts to this with a smile, as Picard examines	the figurine more closely, suddenly the student	attempting to shine before his mentor.					PICARD				(continuing)			The overall configuration is			certainly Fifth Dynasty. But the			surface ornamentation...         STAR TREK: "The Chase" - 02/04/93 - TEASER         4.5    CONTINUED: (2)					GALEN			Yes...	Picard steps closer, leans toward the object, sees an	extremely faded HINT OF COLOR.					PICARD			Green polychrome over the eyes...			And the eyes themselves... open.				(smiles)			Third Dynasty. From the workshop			of the Master of Tarquin Hill.	The Professor nods, pleased.					GALEN			Well done.	Picard explains to Riker.					PICARD			The Master of Tarquin Hill created			ceramic designs that were three			centuries ahead of his time. We			only know him by his work -- his			name has never been discovered...	Picard indicates the figurine.					PICARD				(continuing)			This object is over twelve			thousand years old...					RIKER			The planet Kurl? That's a hell of			a long way outside Federation			territory.	As if that was Picard's next question, the Captain	turns to his former instructor.					PICARD			Indeed. I thought you had			completed your studies of Kurlan			artifacts some time ago.					GALEN			I happened to be in the			neighborhood last summer. I			couldn't resist.         STAR TREK: "The Chase" - 02/04/93 - TEASER         5.5    CONTINUED: (3)	Picard doesn't seem to consider this an answer to his	question, but the Professor immediately refocuses his	attention onto the figurine.					GALEN				(continuing)			Go ahead.	Picard is surprised.					PICARD			It's complete?	Galen answers with a smile. Picard steps over to the	figurine, grasps its sides with both hands and LIFTS --	the top half separates from the bottom, revealing a	hollow interior. Inside are over a dozen TINY	FIGURINES, similar in shape to the original.	Riker steps over to look inside as Picard explains with	excitement.					PICARD			The Kurl believed every individual			is a community of individuals.			Inside us are many voices, each			with its own desires, its own			style, its own way of viewing the			world.	Picard picks up one of the tiny figurines.					PICARD				(continuing)			But Kurlan civilization died out			thousands of years ago. It's rare			to find a figurine intact.				(to the Professor)			A truly incredible find.					GALEN			It's yours, Jean-Luc.	Picard shakes his head.					PICARD			How could I accept this --					GALEN			... Graciously, Mister Picard. You			could accept it graciously.         STAR TREK: "The Chase" - 02/04/93 - TEASER         6.5    CONTINUED: (4)	Picard nods, touched.					PICARD			How long can you stay? There's so			much to talk about.					RIKER			The Professor is scheduled to meet			a Vulcan transport the day after			tomorrow.	Picard's face falls.					PICARD			Two days? That's not nearly			enough time...					GALEN			We may have considerably more than			that.					PICARD			I don't understand.					GALEN			I am currently on an expedition.			A journey into unexplored			historical territory.				(beat)			And I intend to take you with me.	Picard and Riker exchange a surprised look.

TEN FORWARD	Picard is at a table having tea with Professor Galen.	The Captain doesn't frequent Ten Forward, and draws a	few curious glances from the other patrons.					GALEN			I read your paper on the Kea Four			excavation that you delivered at			last year's symposium. It was...			informative.	Picard smiles.					PICARD			Damning with faint praise.					GALEN				(shrugs)			One can hardly serve two masters.			For a Starfleet Captain at the			helm of the Federation flagship...			attendance alone would have been			impressive enough. But you still			managed to present a piece of			original research.				(beat)			A small piece, granted.			Nevertheless, I admire your			tenacity.         STAR TREK: "The Chase" - 02/04/93 - ACT ONE         8.7    CONTINUED:					PICARD			I had hoped to see you there. You			said in your last letter that you			might go.					GALEN			Much too busy, I'm afraid. I was			on the far side of the Aolian			Cluster at the time.	Picard reacts with surprise. Then...					PICARD			Professor Galen, may I ask a frank			question?					GALEN			Please.					PICARD			Your published writings have			been... sporadic over the last			ten years or so. Your appearances			at symposia have been rare -- or			scheduled and then cancelled at			the last minute. The finest			archaeologist of the century has			become shrouded with an air of			mystery.					GALEN			And my reputation as a result has			no doubt grown.					PICARD				(smiles)			I've yet to run across anyone that			didn't love a good mystery.					GALEN			The Sataaran of Sothis Three			disdain them.				(nods)			Nevertheless, as a general			principle, your statement holds.	A beat. Picard leans forward.					PICARD			Professor, what have you been			doing for the last decade?         STAR TREK: "The Chase" - 02/04/93 - ACT ONE         9.7    CONTINUED: (2)					GALEN			Are you familiar with			micropaleontology?					PICARD				(nods)			Studying fossil records at a			microscopic level. I remember			reading your papers on the			subject. But that was years			ago... Then your work seemed to			stop.					GALEN			No. The work continued.	The man lowers his voice.					GALEN				(continuing)			I made a discovery so profound in			its implications that silence			seemed the wisest course.	He pauses a moment.					GALEN				(continuing)			This... work has occupied my every			waking thought, it's intruded upon			my dreams. It's become my life.			And when it's finished, when I			announce my findings...				(beat)			It will be heard half-way across			the galaxy.	Picard reacts.					PICARD			Tell me --      STAR TREK: "The Chase" - REV. 02/05/93 - ACT ONE      10.7    CONTINUED: (3)					GALEN			... I'm sorry, Mister Picard. But			that information has a price --			your agreement to join me on the			final leg of this expedition.	A silent beat.					PICARD			For how long?					GALEN			Three months. Perhaps a year. If			we had a starship and complete			diplomatic access -- a matter of			weeks. But we'll have only my			shuttle, the transports we can			arrange, and our combined talents.					PICARD			Why can't you do this without me?	The Professor looks at him for a moment, then glances	away.					GALEN			I'm not a young man. There will			be hazards along the way. I don't			want my own inadequacies to			jeopardize the completion of this			work.					PICARD			Professor, I'm honored that you'd			think of me. But I have a			responsibility --					GALEN			... to History. What if you could			have helped Schliemann discover			the City of Troy? Or if you had			been with M'Tell as she stepped			upon Ya'Seem for the first time?				(beat)			How could anything compare?	A long, silent beat. Picard stands.					PICARD			May I sleep on it?	The Professor nods.					GALEN			Dream not of today, Mister Picard.        STAR TREK: "The Chase" - 02/04/93 - ACT ONE        11.7    CONTINUED: (4)	Picard smiles, remembering.					PICARD			"Dream not of today." The night			blessing of the Yash-El.					GALEN			As I recall, you missed that			question on the final exam.					PICARD			I've had a few years to look it			up.				(beat)			The Enterprise is yours, for as			long as you're here.	Galen acknowledges the gesture with a nod of thanks.					PICARD				(continuing)			Dream not of today, Professor.	Picard heads for the door.

The ancient	FIGURINE is in front of him, open, the tiny figures	visible inside. The door CHIMES.					PICARD			Come.	The door opens and BEVERLY steps inside, her cheeriness	in sharp contrast to Picard's contemplative mood.					BEVERLY			Good morning.				(beat)			You look like you've been up for			awhile.	She goes to the replicator.      STAR TREK: "The Chase" - REV. 02/05/93 - ACT ONE      12.9    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Yes.	Beverly reacts, then turns to the replicator.					BEVERLY				(to replicator)			One tea, Earl Grey, hot. One			macchiato.	The SOUND of the replicator. She turns away from it	with a mug of tea and a tiny cappuccino in an espresso	cup. She takes them over to Picard, then sits next to	him.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			Let's hear it...					PICARD			I had a long talk with Professor			Galen last night. He asked me to			leave the Enterprise -- to join			him on an archaeological			expedition that could last a year.					BEVERLY			Jean-Luc... that must be tempting.					PICARD			I wouldn't leave the Enterprise.			But the offer itself has made me			feel a certain... regret.					BEVERLY			That you could have been an			archaeologist instead of a			starship Captain?					PICARD			Not exactly. I'm certainly not			sorry about the path I've taken...      STAR TREK: "The Chase" - REV. 02/05/93 - ACT ONE      13.9    CONTINUED: (2)	Picard sips his tea, sets it down.					PICARD				(continuing)			But... there's a certain...			passion that comes with the			singleminded pursuit of the past.	He picks up one of the tiny figurines.					PICARD				(continuing)			To be captured by an image created			by another's hand, hundreds or			thousands of years ago. A being			long dead, who still speaks to you			through that image, who says "I			was alive, as you are alive."	Picard sets the figurine on the table in front of them.					PICARD				(continuing)			I've only approximated that			feeling. Professor Galen made it			his life.	He places the tiny figurine into the larger one with	the others.					PICARD				(continuing)			The Professor didn't choose this			figure at random -- the many			voices inside the one. He knows			that the past is one of the most			insistent voices inside me. This			gift was meant to remind me of			that.					BEVERLY			And the exploration of space?			Surely that counts for			something...	Picard smiles.      STAR TREK: "The Chase" - REV. 02/05/93 - ACT ONE      14.9    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			I wouldn't trade it for anything.			And I'd still make the same			decision I made all those years			ago.				(beat)			I'm just sorry I have to say no to			him a second time.					BEVERLY			You two were very close, weren't			you?					PICARD			I had a father. But Professor			Galen was like a father who			understood me. And he had			children -- but none followed in			his footsteps. So, I was like the			son who understood him.					BEVERLY			I guess it was difficult for both			of you when you left.					PICARD			The Professor is somewhat...			internal. He doesn't express			feelings easily. But it was			difficult for me.	Picard picks up the top half of the larger figurine and	replaces it onto the lower.					PICARD				(continuing)			In some ways, I wish he'd never			come on board.	OFF the figure, with its enigmatic expression...10   INT.
