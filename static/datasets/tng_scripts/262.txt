SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	In orbit around the planet Atrea.					PICARD (V.O)			Captain's Log, Stardate 47410.2.			The Atrean government has			requested assistance in averting			a natural disaster that is			threatening their world. Two of			their geologists have come aboard			to discuss the problem, one of			whom is a human who has been			living on Atrea Four.2    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)	PICARD, GEORDI, and DATA look on as Atrean Scientist	PRAN TAINER stands before an OKUDAGRAM depicting a	cross-section of the Atrean planet. Also present is	Pran's human wife, JULIANA TAINER, a fiftyish woman	dressed in Atrean fashion. The Atreans are a humanoid	species, only slightly different from us.					JULIANA			Captain, our situation has			worsened since my husband and I			first contacted you. The molten			core of our planet is not just			cooling -- it's begun to solidify.					PRAN			Our gravitational field has been			affected -- seismic activity has			increased by a factor of three.					JULIANA			If the cooling continues at this			rate -- Atrea will become			uninhabitable within thirteen			months.	Everyone takes in this grim news.     STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/29/93 - TEASER     1A.2    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			We could minimize seismic activity			by creating isobaric fissures and			releasing some of the tectonic			stress -- but that would just be			a temporary fix.					DATA			The only permanent solution would			be to re-liquefy the core.	Geordi stands and moves to the Okudagram.					GEORDI			These pockets in the magma layer --			how close are they to the molten			region of the core?					JULIANA			A few kilometers, why?	Geordi turns to Data.					GEORDI			You think that's close enough to			try ferro-plasmic infusion?	Data considers, then acknowledges the possibility.	Juliana and Pran share a look -- they're not sure what	this means.      STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/29/93 - TEASER      2.2    CONTINUED: (2)	Data moves toward the monitor, gesturing.					DATA			The procedure would involve using			our ship's phasers to drill down			through the planet's surface and			into the pockets -- where we would			set up a series of plasma infusion			units.					GEORDI			We'd trigger the units by firing			a modulated energy burst down			through the shafts.	Juliana addresses Data.					JULIANA			I see... injecting sufficient			plasma directly into the core			should trigger a chain reaction...			and that will reliquify the			magma...					DATA			It should be possible to stabilize			the core temperature at ninety-three			percent of normal.					PRAN			If it works, the core would remain			molten for centuries.	Picard lets Pran and Juliana consider for a beat.					PICARD			If you give your permission, we'll			begin immediately.					PRAN			Very well. But before we proceed,			I'd like to update our geological			surveys.        STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - 09/27/93 - TEASER        3.2    CONTINUED: (3)					GEORDI			I'll be glad to help you, Doctor.					PICARD				(to Pran and Juliana)			I've assigned you quarters during			the time we're here. Please make			yourselves comfortable.					PRAN			Thank you, Captain.	The meeting breaks up and Picard, Pran, and Geordi	EXIT. Data starts to follow, but Juliana stops him.					JULIANA			Data --	Data turns to her.					DATA			Yes, Doctor?      STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/29/93 - TEASER      4.2    CONTINUED: (4)	She has an almost expectant look on her face -- a kind	of breathless anticipation.					JULIANA			Do you have any idea who I am?	Data is puzzled by the question.					DATA			You are Doctor Juliana Tainer.	Juliana exhales slightly, as though a question of long	standing had finally been resolved.					JULIANA			You lost all your early memories.			We thought you would -- but we			couldn't know for certain.	Data is now even more puzzled. He looks at her	quizzically.					DATA			Have we met before?	She looks at him with what can only be called pride,	eyes shining.					JULIANA			Oh, Data, I was there -- right			from the beginning, on Omicron			Theta. I helped create you.				(proudly)			And now... look at you.					DATA				(taken aback)			You were a colleague of Doctor			Soong?	She laughs, a warm, merry laugh that lights her face.					JULIANA			Yes, I certainly was -- and I was			also his wife. In a way, I			suppose you could say -- I'm your			mother.	Off Data's reaction to this unexpected revelation...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT ONE     5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            3    INT. TEN FORWARD	Data and Juliana at a table. Her eyes are shining as	she looks at him...					JULIANA			I still can't believe it... seeing			you again after all these years...	Data is curious about the situation, but of course not	sharing Juliana's emotional response.					DATA			Doctor, I have no memory of you.					JULIANA			There's a reason for that... we			wiped your processors after we'd			finished refining your			programming.	She leans forward, looks at him lovingly.					JULIANA				(continuing)			Why don't you tell me what you do			remember... and then I'll fill in			the gaps.					DATA				(pondering)			My memory record begins when I was			activated by the Starfleet			officers who found me on the			Omicron Theta outpost.					JULIANA			After the attack by the			Crystalline Entity --					DATA			Yes. All of the inhabitants of			the colony had been killed.	Juliana acknowledges somberly.     STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT ONE     6.3    CONTINUED:					DATA			But -- I discovered that my memory			banks contained the contents of			their journals and logs.					JULIANA				(a gentle smile)			We thought you might find their			experiences useful... after your			childhood, we figured you needed			all the help you could get.					DATA			My -- childhood?					JULIANA				(laughing)			That's what I called it. You were			like a baby at first -- a hundred			kilogram baby, but still...	She shakes her head, smiling at the recollection.					JULIANA				(continuing)			It took you a while to develop			motor skills... learn how to			process sensory information. And			of course Noonian was never			satisfied... he kept tinkering,			trying to make you as human as			possible. And then there was the			business about hiccuping...					DATA			Hiccuping?					JULIANA			He was determined that you'd have			periodic bouts of hiccups, but he			couldn't get it right -- they were			either too violent, or too			prolonged, or not noticeable at			all... I finally said, good			heavens, Noonian -- nobody likes			having hiccups. Why don't you			just forget it? So he did.	She smiles again, enjoying these reveries. But Data is	still interested in getting information.					DATA			So you wiped my memory processors			after this -- childhood.     STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT ONE     7.3    CONTINUED: (2)					JULIANA			Then we deactivated you -- and			programmed you with the colonists'			logs. We were planning to reactivate			you.				(beat, more somber)			But we never had the chance. The			Crystalline Entity attacked... we			had to leave quickly. We wanted			to bring you with us -- but there			was only room for two in the			escape pod.	There is a beat as Data considers this.					DATA			Doctor, I have scanned the			colonists' journals... there is			only one Juliana mentioned in			them, and her last name is			O'Donnell.					JULIANA			That's me...					DATA			But there is no mention that my			father was married to you.	She shakes her head, again smiling at a recollection.					JULIANA			Because of my mother.				(off his look)			She thought Noonian was an			eccentric scientist who was too			old for me... we decided to get			married secretly and give her some			time to get used to the idea of			our being together.	She leans forward, conspiratorially.					JULIANA				(continuing)			We slipped away to Mavala Four and			got married there... a Klingon and			a Corvallan trader were our			witnesses...					(MORE)     STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT ONE     8.3    CONTINUED: (3)					JULIANA (Cont'd)				(a bit wistful)			It wasn't exactly the wedding I'd			hoped for, but Noonian had a way			of making the oddest things seem			romantic...					DATA			My father did have an unusual way			of looking at things...					JULIANA				(surprised)			How would you know that?					DATA			I encountered him once -- in the			Terlina system.					JULIANA				(excited)			That's where we went -- after we			left the outpost... I had no idea			you'd ever met him.					DATA			It was shortly before his death.	There is a shocked pause.					JULIANA			He's... dead?					DATA			Yes.	Juliana seems to shrink into herself for a moment,	grappling with this unexpected news.					JULIANA			I didn't think it would hit me			this hard...				(beat, struggling for				 control)			We didn't exactly part on the best			of terms...					DATA			What do you mean?     STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT ONE     8A.3    CONTINUED: (4)					JULIANA			I realized that he loved his work			as much as he loved me. Maybe			more. There we were, stuck on			that planet in the middle of a			jungle... no one else to talk to,			no -- no life. It just wasn't			enough...				(beat)			That's why I left.	This was clearly a difficult decision for her. After	a moment she looks up at him, reassuring, smiling her	lovely smile.					JULIANA				(continuing)			Anyway, it was a long time ago.			What's important is that we're			together now.	She touches his arm.					JULIANA				(continuing)			And I want to get to know you.	But Data hesitates. This has been a lot to assimilate	in one sitting, and he isn't sure how to respond.     STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT ONE     8B.3    CONTINUED: (5)					DATA			This has been an interesting			encounter, and one altogether			unexpected. I would like to			corroborate what you have told me			before we proceed further.	Juliana stares at him... his lack of emotion is hard	for her to accept. She clearly hoped for a more	positive response.					DATA			Excuse me, Doctor.	Off her face as he EXITS...     STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT ONE     9.4    OMITTED5    EXT.

I almost get the			feeling you're trying to prove			that Doctor Tainer wasn't telling			the truth.					DATA			Not at all.

Juliana	moves to help him.					JULIANA			What happened?					PRAN			We were running a final check on			the infusion unit when part of the			wall gave way...					GEORDI				(off console)			It looks like the area has			stabilized, but seismic stress is			building up -- eventually, the			pocket will collapse.                                             INTERCUT:35   INT.

But I want you in and			out of there as quickly as			possible.					DATA			Acknowledged, Commander.					JULIANA				(to Pran)			You're hurt. I'll go.	Pran touches her arm with concern. She and Data move	to the Transporter Pad. Geordi is studying the	monitor.					GEORDI				(to Data)			One of the transporter's pattern			enhancers was thrown out of			alignment by the seismic activity --			I'm getting a normal power			signature from it so you should be			able to re-align it for the beam			out.	Data acknowledges.					DATA			Energize.36   INT. THE SECOND MAGMA POCKET (OPTICAL)	as Data and Juliana MATERIALIZE near the THREE PATTERN	ENHANCERS, one of which is tipped over. Data rights	it.	As before, the only light comes from their PALM BEACONS	and from practical sources our people have set up	previously. The low-level RUMBLE of molten magma can	be HEARD in the distance.	Suddenly, there's a TREMOR -- and when it subsides, a	sharply defined ledge of about two feet separates the	floor they're standing on from the rest of the cavern --	much like an earthquake fault-line.    STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT FOUR    36A.36   CONTINUED:	Data scans it with his TRICORDER.         STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT FOUR        37.36   CONTINUED:					DATA			There will be more seismic			activity.

They	move off...37   A NARROW PASSAGEWAY	as they move through it and pass out of frame.38   THE FIRST MAGMA POCKET	as they approach the INFUSION UNIT. Rubble strews the	area, and it seems that the unit may have been damaged	by falling rocks. Concerned, Juliana starts working	one of the consoles. Already, the heat has caused her	to break into a sweat.	Data looks up toward the ceiling, raises his Tricorder	to scan.39   THE SHAFT -- MATTE (OPTICAL)	as he looks up into the shaft that we drilled from	orbit -- it's cylindrical and smooth-walled, and	although it's too dark to see much of it, we get the	sense that it leads up through miles of rock.40   RESUME SCENE	as Data studies his tricorder.					DATA			The shaft has not been obstructed			by the seismic activity -- it			should be possible to trigger the			unit from orbit.					JULIANA				(as she works)			The infuser's been damaged...			we're going to have to start the			programming sequence all over			again...           STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - 09/27/93 - ACT FOUR           38.40   CONTINUED:	She continues working, and Data joins her at one of the	unit's side consoles.

Are you all right?	Data doesn't answer until the tremor subsides.           STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - 09/27/93 - ACT FOUR           39.41   CONTINUED:					DATA			Yes, Commander. We will be			returning to the beam-out point			shortly.	Juliana finishes working -- dust kicked up by the	tremor fills the air around them...					JULIANA			That's it -- let's go.	They move off...42   THE NARROW PASSAGEWAY	as they head back the way the came. A small AFTERSHOCK	causes dust and debris to fall from above. They hurry	on.43   THE SECOND MAGMA POCKET	as they approach the ledge that drops down to the beamout	point. They react to something --44   WIDEN	so that we see that the cavern floor where the pattern	enhancers were dropped another thirty feet during the	last tremor. Juliana and Data are standing on the edge	of a precipice, there's no way to climb down its sheer	face, and the pattern enhancers are strewn on the floor	below.					JULIANA			Can we transport without the			pattern enhancers?					DATA			No, we are too far below the			surface.					JULIANA				(concerned)			How are we going to get down			there?	Data looks around.					DATA			There are no hand-holds in the			rock face.           STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - 09/27/93 - ACT FOUR           40.44   CONTINUED:	Suddenly another VIOLENT TREMOR hits -- the ceiling	starts to give around them. Data has to shout to be	heard over the din.					DATA				(continuing)			We will have to jump.	Juliana can't believe what she's hearing.					JULIANA			It's too far... I won't make it...	Large ROCKS crash down near them -- close, getting	closer...					DATA			You will --	Data takes her firmly by the left arm and leaps off the	edge of the cliff --45   ANOTHER ANGLE	as they land on the floor below. Data is able to	absorb the shock, but Juliana hits the ground hard and	is thrown to the floor.	Data moves to her and discovers that she's been knocked	unconscious. To our astonishment, her arm has been	torn off to reveal a mass of WIRES and BLINKING	CIRCUITRY -- Juliana Soong is an android.	Data stares down at her arm (a small amount of blood is	visible where the skin is torn) -- strangely, he does	not seem unduly surprised by what he sees.	Off this moment we...                                             FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                                    STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - 09/27/93 - ACT FIVE           41.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:46   INT. SICKBAY	Beverly and Geordi are examining the still-unconscious	Juliana, who is laid-out on the center bio-bed in a	hospital gown. Riker and Data stand nearby.	Juliana's arm has been repaired, and a PANEL on her	head is open to reveal a mass of BLINKING CIRCUITRY.	As Geordi reports to Riker, we get a sense that he's	awed by the complexity of her design.					GEORDI			Basically, she's a Soong-type			android -- except everything about			her is designed to fool you into			thinking she's human.					BEVERLY			She's got tear ducts, sweat glands --			even veins and capillaries			underneath her skin.	Riker indicates the Medical Diagnostic panel.					RIKER			Why does the scanner read her as			a human?					BEVERLY			There's a feedback processor			that's designed to send out a			false bio-signal.					GEORDI			It's tied in with her aging			program -- she not only ages in			appearance, like Data, her vital			signs change too.					BEVERLY			What I can't figure out is why she			lost consciousness. As far as I			can see, everything's fine -- she			should be awake.					DATA			Check her positronic matrix --			there may be a cascade anomaly.         STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT FIVE        42.46   CONTINUED:	Geordi and Beverly acknowledge and set to work. Riker	turns to Data.					RIKER			Data -- you said you knew she was			an android... how?					DATA			The first indication occurred when			we were drilling. I saw her			perform several complex			calculations without the			assistance of the computer.					RIKER			That could just have meant she was			good at math --					DATA			That is true. But it was enough			to draw my attention. Later, I			noticed something odd about the			way she blinked her eyes.	Riker has no idea what could be coming next.					DATA				(continuing)			The intervals between blinks were			governed by a Fourier Series --			the same mathematical formula my			father used to give my blinking			pattern the appearance of			randomness.					RIKER			I can't imagine anyone but you			noticing something like that.					DATA			Then there was our concert in Ten			Forward.					RIKER			What about it?         STAR TREK: "Inheritance" - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT FIVE        43.46   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA				(continuing)			We had practiced the piece, and I			noticed that she played it the			same way during the performance --			every pitch, every intonation, was			exactly the same.
