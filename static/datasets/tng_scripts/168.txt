Off Data's	puzzled expression as he follows them.15   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	O'Brien behind console, as Tam Elbrun MATERIALIZES on	the transporter. He's a mid-thirties Betazoid, with	wide, dark eyes. He appears nervous.

Here --	Tam reaches into his pocket and produces a data	cassette. He flips it casually to Picard as he steps	down. Picard catches it, annoyed. Tam's attitude is	abrupt and rude.					TAM				(continuing)			You want to know all about your			mission. Everything's on there.			Orders and briefings. Destination			and heading, all that.16   ANGLE ON PICARD AND DATA	standing by transporter console. Picard is visibly	annoyed. He hands the cassette to Data, who accepts it	and steps toward Tam as if to ask a question.					TAM				(to Troi)			I sensed you were out here.			How've you been?17   ANGLE ON TROI					TROI				(embarrassed by Tam's				 tactlessness, she still				 can't help smiling)			Fine, but Tam, I...               TAM                         TROI     Thought you were on     ... thought you were on     Chandra Five.            Chandra Five.	They laugh -- this is a familiar routine to them both.	Data now has come to stand behind Tam, unnoticed.        STAR TREK: "Tin Man" - REV. 2/2/90 - ACT ONE        9.17   CONTINUED:					DATA			Sir --	Tam whirls on Data as if a rocket just went off behind	him. NO ONE has EVER approached Tam Elbrun without his	awareness. Until now.					TAM			Who -- what are you?					DATA				(puzzled)			My name is Data.	Tam locks gazes with Troi, READING the answers he wants	from HER MIND. Then he looks back at Data, fascinated	as a child with a new toy.					TAM			Incredible, an android. I can't			read you at all. It's like you're			not there.	Data frowns, puzzled. Tam notices the cassette in the	android's hand.					TAM			Oh. You better hurry up to the			bridge with that. Captain wants			you to run the orders, scan the			technical schematics, and be ready			to brief him in ten minutes.				(to Picard)			Right?	Picard activates his communicator.					PICARD			Number One?					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Riker here.					PICARD			Meet Mister Data on the bridge.			He has our orders and new heading.					RIKER			Aye, sir.	Picard nods to Data.

To prevent			misunderstanding.					GEORDI			That was Tam Elbrun? And what			happened was his fault?	Riker considers a moment, before answering.					RIKER			Not directly. Board of inquiry			blamed Captain Darson's			carelessness about Ghorusdan			cultural taboos.				(pause)			But if Elbrun's so good, why			didn't he warn Darson? What was			he there for, if he couldn't sense			that much hostility?21   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Data is at Science One. Worf at Tactical.	Supernumeraries at all other stations. Data is loading	the data chip. Geordi and Riker stand at Data's	shoulder.					DATA			Commander, Geordi... do you ever			feel as if I am not "there?" That			is to say... not "here."	Reactions from others.

OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Present are Picard, Riker, Geordi, Troi, Data, Worf	and Tam Elbrun. Tam is seated next to Data. NOTE:	throughout this scene Tam should appear distracted by	pain, as from a bad headache.        STAR TREK: "Tin Man" - REV. 2/2/90 - ACT ONE        13.23   CLOSE ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)	of a RED SUPERGIANT STAR. Flashing around it in close	orbit is a TINY, BRILLIANT WHITE light.					DATA			This is the star Beta Stromgren...24   PULL BACK TO SHOW OUR PEOPLE AND TAM SEATED AROUNDTABLE					DATA				(continuing)			Scientists have discovered that			it is in the final stages of an			alternating cycle of expansion			and collapse, which will soon			result in a supernova.				(beat)			However, the long-range unmanned			probe which Starfleet sent to			observe the process has discovered			something much more --					TAM				(exasperated)			Oh, Data -- don't waste time.	Tam reaches past a startled Data and PUNCHES the	projector CONTROLS. The screen FREEZES its motion.	A FRAME APPEARS around the star's tiny companion, and	the framed area is MAGNIFIED to REPLACE the star image.25   CLOSE ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)	The new image is a SLENDER OBJECT which PULSES WITH	LIGHT, of organic appearance. At the aft end of the	object are two GLOWING ORANGE GRIDS -- clearly ENGINES.	The whole surface of the thing is NETWORKED by faintly	pulsing pale white ENERGY PATHS, suggesting something	between lightning charges and a human circulatory	system.					TAM			They call it "Tin Man". The Vega			Probe found it orbiting Stromgren.        STAR TREK: "Tin Man" - REV. 2/2/90 - ACT ONE        14.26   BACK TO SHOT (OPTICAL)					GEORDI			Looks like a ship of some kind.					TAM			Its energy source is unknown.			The people who've studied the			transmissions think it's a			starship. And they're sure it's			alive.					PICARD				(immediately fascinated)			Alive? How so?					GEORDI			A cybernetic organism -- like the			Borg?					TAM			No, no, NO! Here --	Tam manipulates the projector controls again. Data	looks on, bemused, as the image on the screen is	replaced by rotating multi-plane artwork representing	interior diagrams and schematics of Tin Man.					TAM			Starfleet believes it's an			organic creature, born in space,			living its life in the wastes			between stars.	Tam RISES, WINCING slightly, and PACES the room,	growing more excited as he speaks. Troi notices his	discomfort.					TAM				(continuing)			No one knows where it came from,			or why it's here now. And we're			going to meet it. We're going			to talk to it.				(softly, as if to				 himself)			I'm going to talk to it.	Riker regards Tam dubiously.					RIKER			Have attempts been made --        STAR TREK: "Tin Man" - REV. 2/6/90 - ACT ONE        15.26   CONTINUED:					TAM			To communicate with it by			subspace. Of course --			linguacode, universal translation,			all that. It won't work. Tin Man			is too different. Direct			mind-to-mind contact is our only			hope.					TROI			The opportunity for discovery is			extraordinary -- but I don't yet			understand Starfleet's urgency			--	Tam turns to Troi, a little blankly -- the telepath	is lost in imagination.					PICARD			The Romulans --					TAM			Hell, I forgot -- the Romulans...					PICARD			They claim the sector of space			in which Beta Stromgren is			located.					WORF			The Romulans claim all that is			within their field of vision.					DATA			And they routinely monitor the			telemetry of our deep-space			probes.					PICARD			So it's quite certain they'll			be sending a ship of their own			to investigate this Tin Man.        STAR TREK: "Tin Man" - REV. 2/6/90 - ACT ONE        16.26   CONTINUED: (2)					TAM			No... Actually, they're sending			two. Uh, Data --	Riker reacts -- concerned.					DATA			That is correct. Starbase one			twenty-three detected two			D'daridex class cruisers on an			intercept course.				(to Picard)			The top speed of this class vessel			is known to be less than our own,			sir.

The			possibility of an encounter with			Romulans on this mission is hardly			trivial. Yet you --					TAM				(interrupting)			All right, all right... I should			have brought up the Romulans			earlier, but I was distracted.	Riker looks annoyed.

In what sense?					TROI			In most Betazoids their telepathic			gifts develop at adolescence.					PICARD			They're not born reading minds?        STAR TREK: "Tin Man" - REV. 2/6/90 - ACT TWO        20.30   CONTINUED:					TROI			No. Except... for some reason			that no one understands,			occasionally a Betazoid child is			born different.					PICARD			How "different?"					TROI			Born with their telepathic			abilities "switched on."			Most Betazoids born like that			never lead a normal life.					BEVERLY				(understanding now)			The noise of other people's			thoughts and feelings must be...			overwhelming.

I'm afraid for him.					PICARD			Afraid of what?					TROI			I sense that the alien is somehow			calling him. If we allow him to			do as he insists -- to beam over			-- I'm afraid that we'll lose him			to it.				(pause)			That he will lose himself.					DATA			Captain, I agree that Tam's			motives are trustworthy.
