We will be within			sensor range in three hours...2    INT. TEN FORWARD	DATA and TROI are sitting at the bar, immersed in a	game of three-dimensional chess. Data is clearly	winning. He moves a piece, then waits as Troi	contemplates the board. Troi moves a piece. Data	reacts, puzzled.					DATA			The characteristic response to			the Kriskov Gambit is to counter			with an el-Mitra Exchange --			particularly since I have already			taken both your rooks. By missing			that opportunity, you have left			your king vulnerable.					TROI			We'll see...					DATA				(shrugs)			As you wish.	Data makes a move that takes one of Troi's pieces.					DATA				(continuing)			Check.       STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - REV. 11/25/91 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:	Troi immediately makes a counter move. Data reacts,	puzzled. Then studies the board for several seconds.					DATA			Intriguing. You have devised a			completely unanticipated response			to a classic attack.				(beat)			You will checkmate my king in			seven moves.	Troi starts putting the pieces back to their original	starting positions.					TROI			Chess isn't just a game of gambits			and ploys -- it's also a game of			intuition.					DATA			You are a challenging opponent.					TROI			Thanks. But don't think a			compliment's going to get you out			of our bet.				(beat)			You owe me one Samarian Sunset.			Served in the traditional style.			As only you can make it, Data...					DATA			I will honor our agreement.	Data stands and walks toward the bar. OFF Troi's	smile...3    INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)	BEVERLY is running a medical scanner over the shoulder	and upper arm of a very athletic woman in her	mid-twenties -- KRISTIN -- who is wearing a one-piece	24th-century SWIMSUIT, and sitting on a bio-bed.	Kristin is gritting her teeth in obvious pain.					BEVERLY			Raise your arm out to the side.	Kristin does so -- but only comes up about halfway.      STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - REV. 11/25/91 - TEASER      2A.3    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY				(re: the elevation)			Is that it?					KRISTIN			I'm afraid so.	A beat as Beverly takes another reading.					BEVERLY			You can put your arm down now.	Kristin does so.					KRISTIN				(re: Beverly's readings)			What do you think?					BEVERLY				(lightly)			I think it looks like you tucked			when you should have flattened			out.       STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - REV. 11/25/91 - TEASER       3.3    CONTINUED: (2)					KRISTIN			Something like that...					BEVERLY			Turn your head to the left.	Kristin does so -- and winces. Beverly continues	waving the instrument.					BEVERLY			Some tearing in the ligaments --			nothing we can't take care of.					KRISTIN			Good.	Beverly takes the instrument down.					BEVERLY			If I remember correctly, the last			time you graced my sickbay, you			were diving off the "Cliffs of			Heaven" on Cirrus Four. Holodeck			program 47-C.					KRISTIN			Same thing. Only that time, I			flattened out when I should have			tucked.					BEVERLY			As your Doctor, I'd like to			recommend the Emerald Wading Pool			on Sumiko Three. It's a lot			safer.	Kristin can't help but smile.4    OMITTED4A   INT. TURBOLIFT	As Riker and Ro enter in the middle of an	argument... she's smiling at him as they go at it, she	almost enjoys the exchange...					RIKER			Navigators on this ship have been			doing flight handling assessments			the same way for years, Ensign...       STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - REV. 11/15/91 - TEASER       4.4A   CONTINUED:					RO			And I've found a better way...					RIKER				(to com)			Bridge.				(beat)			Do you mind if we discuss changes			in procedure before you make them?					RO			If I had come to you in advance			and asked you if I could do it			my way...					RIKER			I would have said...					RO			"No".					RIKER			Or maybe "yes".	His answer surprises her. She doesn't respond.					RIKER				(continuing)			The point is -- I never got that			chance.					RO			The point is... with all due			respect... you're trying to turn			me into your idea of a model			officer.					RIKER			Ensign... the rules on this ship			don't change because Ro Laren			decides they do.	The turbolift door opens. As they EXIT --         STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - 11/14/91 - TEASER         4A.5    INT. BRIDGE	PICARD and WORF are at their stations; GEORDI at an aft	console.					WORF				(off console)			We are picking up a subspace			signal, Captain.

Reading			one life-form aboard.					PICARD			Hail the vessel.	A beat of silence.					WORF			No response, Captain.					GEORDI				(off console)			We're being scanned... but it's			not like any sensor system I've			ever seen... Should we raise			shields?					PICARD			No. We'll start this off with			a show of good faith.	Geordi nods. A beat.					WORF			Sir, the scans are now matching			the frequencies of our optical			data network.					(MORE)         STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - 11/14/91 - TEASER         6.6    CONTINUED:					WORF (cont'd)				(looks up)			It could be an attempt to access			our computer system.	Geordi glances up from his console.					GEORDI			Scanning intensity has increased			by fifteen hundred percent.					PICARD			Shields up.7    INT. TEN FORWARD	Troi is at the bar. Data is BEHIND THE BAR, serving	Troi a glass of gray liquid.					DATA				(re: drink)			One Samarian Sunset, served in			the traditional style.	Data sets the drink down, then flicks the lip of the	glass with his finger. The glass PINGS --8    THE DRINK (OPTICAL)	instantly comes alive with exotic colors. A sunset in	a glass.9    RESUME	Troi is delighted.					TROI			It's beautiful.	Data nods.					DATA			I hope you enjoy it.	Troi reaches for the drink -- Data again nods. Exactly	the same motion he performed before.         STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - 11/14/91 - TEASER         7.9    CONTINUED:					DATA				(continuing)			I hope you enjoy it.	His voice is exactly the same. Troi looks up to see	Data now completely still, as if frozen.	OFF her reaction.10   INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	As before. Worf is rapidly working his console,	stunned at what he sees.					WORF			The scanning signal has penetrated			our shields...					GEORDI			Our computers are going down!					PICARD			Take evasive action --	As Ro tries to react --					RO			-- The helm's not responding!	FLASH! A BRIGHT GREEN LIGHT fills the bridge,	completely washing out the scene. A moment later, as	the light slowly FADES...11   CLOSE ON PICARD	In the same position as before, tense and ready for	action. Except now, his expression is blank and	movements uncertain. He looks disoriented, touches his	head, squints as if it aches. Then suddenly he stops,	looks around.					PICARD			What happened?12   REVEAL	Everyone else on the bridge, behaving the same way.	Disoriented, looking around, uncertain of their	bearings.         STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - 11/14/91 - TEASER         8.13   GEORDI AND WORF	look at each other as if strangers meeting for the	first time.					GEORDI			What the hell...14   RO	stares dumbfounded at her hands still on the console --	not knowing what they're doing there.15   PICARD AND RIKER	look at each other. Riker glances at the others.					RIKER			I don't know who any of you are.	Picard stares at him, his mind a blank.					PICARD				(to Riker)			Neither do I... I don't even			remember who I am...	Picard exchanges a glance with the person standing next	to him...16   REVEAL	MACDUFF, a man in his late thirties, dressed in	Starfleet Command uniform.

ENTERPRISE BRIDGE	Continuous action. Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Ro and	MacDuff are in a state of astonishment. They have all	lost their memories (EXCEPT MACDUFF -- TO REVEAL	LATER). It's a bizarre situation, the Enterprise crew	suddenly strangers in a strange place. Everyone reacts	to their obviously shared predicament.					GEORDI			It looks like we're all in the			same boat.					RIKER				(re: viewscreen)			Make that -- "on the same			starship."18   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	and the motionless stars.					MACDUFF			But who are we?

But our			identities have somehow been			erased, or suppressed.        STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - 11/14/91 - ACT ONE        11.21   CONTINUED:					RIKER			We are on the bridge -- there's			a good chance this is our ship.	A beat at Riker notices the pips on Picard's uniform.					RIKER				(continuing; to Picard)			And it looks like you're the			leader.					WORF			We should not jump to conclusions.				(indicating own sash)			I am... decorated as well.					PICARD			Determining our command structure			isn't crucial right now. Finding			out who we are, and what we're			doing out here is.	A beat. Worf keeps silent. He might not agree, but he	won't argue the point for now.					MACDUFF			But how did this happen? What			did this to us?22   GEORDI	glances up from his station.					GEORDI			More like -- who did this to us?23   RESUME	as everyone looks over toward Geordi.					GEORDI				(indicating monitor)			I've got some intermittent sensor			readings here... the scan keeps			repeating itself -- like it's			stuck. But it looks like there's			metallic debris right in front			of us. Distance: seventeen			kilometers.					RIKER			The remains of another ship?        STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - 11/14/91 - ACT ONE        12.23   CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			That's a good possibility.					WORF			Perhaps we were engaged in battle.					MACDUFF			If they stunned us with some kind			of bioelectric field -- that might			have wiped out our memories.					RO			Then we fired back. Destroyed			them.	There is a moment as they reflect on these	possibilities.					PICARD			If this presumption is correct,			we may have sustained other			damage.				(to COM)			Computer... status report.	No answer.					RIKER			No voice interface...24   GEORDI (OPTICAL)	still at his console and monitor, trying to work the	commands.					GEORDI			No interface, period.        STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - 11/14/91 - ACT ONE        13.24   CONTINUED:	His monitor suddenly comes alive with a rotating	graphic of the Enterprise.					GEORDI			Hey -- got something.25thru	OMITTED2627   RESUME	as everyone reacts. A beat as Geordi works the	console.					GEORDI				(continuing)			I've accessed the basic system			directories.					PICARD			Can you give us a general status			report?					GEORDI				(nodding)			... Life-support systems are fully			operational throughout the ship.			Navigation and propulsion... Off			line.					RO			What about communications?					GEORDI			Completely disrupted.					RO			That rules out a distress signal.					RIKER			If we even knew where to send it.	Riker and Ro exchange a look. Ro is finding this	situation particularly difficult to handle -- but	there's a "we're in this together" kind of feel between	them, in contrast to what we saw before they lost their	memories.					PICARD			Do we have an onboard			communication system?	Geordi makes a quick pass on the console, which BEEPS	in response. He turns to Picard.        STAR TREK: "Conundrum" - 11/14/91 - ACT ONE        14.27   CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			We do now.	Picard looks at the others.					PICARD			I suggest we use it.
