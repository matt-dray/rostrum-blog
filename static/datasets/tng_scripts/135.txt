O'BRIEN, GEORDI and	DATA pulling out chairs. Data wears an eyeshade. Data	is almost into the chair when O'Brien stops him.					O'BRIEN			Hold it, that's my chair. My luck			is always lousy unless I start			on the dealer's left.					DATA			That would seem to be rank			superstition.					O'BRIEN			Bitter experience has taught me			it's a fundamental truth.					RIKER				(slapping the cards down				 in front of O'Brien				 who cuts them)			The game is five card stud,			nothing's wild.    STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - TEASER    2.3A   CONTINUED:					DATA			This game is exceedingly simple.			With only fifty-two cards,			seventeen of which I will see,			and four players there are a			limited number of possible winning			combinations.					GEORDI			There's more to it than just the			cards.					DATA			The bets will give an indication			of the relative strengths of each			hand.					O'BRIEN				(with a wink to Riker)			Time to pluck a pigeon.	Riker deals the cards. Betting begins with O'Brien,	and proceeds around the table. The third card is	dealt. O'Brien and Geordi pass, Data and Riker bid.	Fourth card, more bids and passes. Fifth card. Bets	are placed. Riker grins.					GEORDI			I think I'm in trouble.	He folds.					RIKER			I'll raise five.					O'BRIEN			Too rich for me.	He tosses his cards.					DATA			I will raise you three.					RIKER			Your three and five more.	Data is becoming increasingly puzzled. He considers	his cards, Riker's cards, considers the pot, studies	Riker's face.    STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - TEASER    3.3A   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			Is this what is known as the poker			face?					RIKER			Are you playing or not?					DATA			I will fold.	Riker rakes in the chips, then turns over his cards	revealing a busted hand. Data turns his cards face	up. He held a winning hand.					DATA				(continuing)			You had nothing.					GEORDI			He bluffed you, Data.					DATA			It makes very little sense to bet			when you cannot win.					RIKER			But I did win. I was gambling			that you wouldn't call.					DATA			But how can you tell?					O'BRIEN			Instinct, Data, instinct.				(he shuffles the cards)			The game is seven card high/low			with a buy on the last card. And			just to make it interesting the			man with the axe takes all.	Data is looking completely bemused as the cards are	dealt.3B   OMITTED3C   EXT.

PICARD sits alone at a table.	Before him is a cup. He suddenly straightens in his	chair as a beautiful WOMAN in her late forties enters.	She is in a Starfleet uniform which clearly is a	surprise to Picard. She is very poised, very	professional, and she scans the room as if searching	for someone. Her eyes light on Picard; and a funny,	ironic little smile curves her lips. Picard rises and	walks up to the passway to join her.3E   ANOTHER ANGLE					PICARD				(with a little edge on				 the words)			My God, if it isn't Phillipa			Louvois, back in uniform.					PHILLIPA			Don't gloat, Picard. It's almost			more irritating then when you're			being self-righteous.					PICARD			Unbelievable, after all this time,			and we're picking up the threads			of old fights as if we'd never			been apart.					PHILLIPA			Ain't love wonderful.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                             STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE   5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:A4	EXT.

STARBASE 173 - LOUNGE	Phillipa and Picard standing on the pass-through.					PICARD			What are you doing out here?					PHILLIPA			I'm in charge of the Sector			twenty-three JAG office. I'll			be making some good law.				(a rueful smile)			And maybe do a little good along			the way, too. What do you think?					PICARD			Anything is possible. You			returned to Starfleet.					PHILLIPA			I had to, it's the most exciting			and worthwhile place to be.					PICARD			You didn't have to leave.					PHILLIPA			They forced me out.					PICARD			No. That was your own damn			stubborn pride.					PHILLIPA				(becoming heated)			When I prosecuted you in the			Stargazer court-martial I was			doing my job.					PICARD			No, you went way beyond doing the			job. You enjoyed it.   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE   6.4    CONTINUED:					PHILLIPA			Not true! A court-martial is			standard when a ship has been			lost. I had a duty as an officer			in the Judge Advocate General.					PICARD			Flummery, you've always enjoyed			the adversarial process more than			arriving at the truth.	They both seem to realize that they are skating	dangerously close to very thin ice. They literally	physically turn away from each other while they recover	their tempers. Picard continues a little gruffly:					PICARD				(continuing)			Well, I hope you've learned a			little wisdom.					PHILLIPA				(lightly)			Watch it, you're doing it again.					PICARD				(forcing a smile, and				 we see the tension				 leech from his body)			I'm not being self-righteous.			Merely right.					PHILLIPA			A distinction, I would submit,			without a difference.					PICARD			Come and sit down.	As they walk down off the pass-through and seat	themselves she says:					PHILLIPA			I can't stay long. I'm meeting			someone for dinner.					PICARD			But he hasn't arrived yet.					PHILLIPA			What makes you think it's a man?   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE   7.4    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Past experience.					PHILLIPA			Cute. Try to remember that you're			an officer and a gentleman.				(she rises)			You know, I never thought I would			say this, but it is good to see			you again. You're still a damn			sexy man, Picard.	This rocks him back in his chair.					PHILLIPA				(continuing; very brisk)			So buy me dinner.					PICARD			I thought you were meeting			someone?	ADMIRAL NAKAMURA enters. With him is BRUCE MADDOX.	They cross to the table.					PHILLIPA				(struggling with				 herself)			Once again you're always right,			Jean-Luc.	Phillipa whirls for a grand exit, and almost bumps	noses with Nakamura.					PHILLIPA				(continuing)			Admiral.					NAKAMURA			Captain Louvois. You're			acquainted with Captain Picard?					PHILLIPA			Yes, we're old... friends.	Phillipa exits.					NAKAMURA			Captain, good to see you again.			May I present Commander Bruce			Maddox. He has an interesting			proposal for you.   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE   8.4    CONTINUED: (3)	Nakamura and Maddox exchange glances.					NAKAMURA				(continuing)			But that can wait until later.			I'm eager to see the Enterprise.	Picard looks from Nakamura to Maddox. Whatever this	"proposal" is, it is going to have import for himself	and his ship.4A   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE	as before, docked at Starbase one-seven-three.5    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Riker watches as Picard, Admiral Nakamura, and Maddox	BEAM ABOARD. SOUND EFFECT in the b.g. as Nakamura is	piped aboard.					PICARD			Admiral, Commander Maddox, allow			me to introduce my first officer,			Commander William Riker.					NAKAMURA			Pleasure, Commander.	They shake hands and begin walking toward the doors.					PICARD			How long has it been since we've			seen each other?					NAKAMURA			You'd just been assigned as an			ensign aboard the old Reliant.					PICARD				(lightly)			Oh yes, and I seem to remember			a certain young lieutenant who			had harsh words about snap			inspections, and the admirals who			pulled them.					NAKAMURA			The situation changes when you've			got the admiral's stripes.   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE   9.5    CONTINUED:	The party steps through the doors and into the	Enterprise corridor.6    INT. CORRIDOR					NAKAMURA			There isn't an officer in			Starfleet who wouldn't give his			right leg to be where you are -- Captain			of the Starship			Enterprise. I'm no different.			I just have the power to get			aboard.					PICARD			Happy to have you, Admiral.	They enter the turbolift.7    INT. TURBOLIFT					PICARD			Bridge. Congratulations on your			appointment. Command of a			Starbase.					NAKAMURA			Thank you, but I miss a ship.			A bit of advice, Captain. Don't			ever become an admiral. They make			you an administrator.	They arrive, and step out onto the bridge.8    INT. MAIN BRIDGE					RIKER			Admiral on the bridge.	On the bridge are Riker, WORF, Data, and WESLEY.	Everyone stiffens slightly, and looks around. Maddox	and Data lock eyes, and Data stands. Picard and	Nakamura converse as they tour the bridge. Riker	notices the by-play and frowns.					PICARD			I was a little surprised at the			decision to put a base in force			this close to the Neutral Zone.   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE   10.8    CONTINUED:					NAKAMURA			As you know, we've had disturbing			news from both sides of the zone.			We're here to respond as needed.			And it won't hurt to have the			Romulans know we're nearby.	They complete their circuit of the bridge.					NAKAMURA				(continuing)			Well, Captain, I thank you for			this opportunity. For five			hundred years ships who've borne			the name Enterprise have been a			legend. This one is no different.					MADDOX				(impatiently)			Admiral.					NAKAMURA			Oh yes, Captain. Commander Maddox			is here to do some work on your			android. Please take care of him.					PICARD			Lieutenant Worf.	He indicates and Worf escorts the admiral off the	bridge.					MADDOX			How have you been, Data?					DATA			My condition does not alter with			the passage of time, Commander.					PICARD			The two of you are acquainted?					MADDOX			Yes, I evaluated Data when it			first applied to the Academy.					DATA			And were the sole member of the			committee to oppose my entrance			on the grounds that I was not a			sentient being.   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE   11.8    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			What exactly will this work			entail?					MADDOX			I'm going to disassemble Data.					PICARD				(pausing for a beat to				 assimilate this)			I think we will remove this			discussion to the lounge.	Riker, Maddox, Data, and Picard walk to the doors.8A   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)	Everyone seated around the table.					PICARD			Explain this procedure.					MADDOX			Ever since I first saw Data at			its entrance evaluation at			Starfleet Academy, I've wanted			to understand it. I became a			student of the works of Doctor			Noonien Soong -- Data's creator.			I've tried to continue his work,			and I believe I am very close to			the breakthrough which will enable			me to duplicate Soong's work and			replicate this.				(Maddox points to Data)			But as a first step I must			disassemble and study it. Data			is going to be my guide.					PICARD			Data?					DATA			It sounds intriguing.					PICARD			How will you proceed?   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE   12.8A   CONTINUED:					MADDOX			I'll run a full diagnostic on			Data, evaluating the condition			of its software. I'll then dump			its core memory into the starbase			mainframe computer and begin a			detailed analysis of its			construction.					DATA			You have constructed a positronic			brain?					MADDOX			Yes.					DATA			Have you determined how the			electron resistance across the			neural filaments is to be			resolved?					MADDOX			Not precisely.					DATA			That would seem to be a necessary			first step.					MADDOX			I'm confident that I'll have the			answer once I've examine the			filament links in your anterior			cortex.					DATA			But if the answer is not			forthcoming, your model will not			function.					MADDOX			I don't anticipate a problem.					PICARD			You seem a little vague on the			specifics. What are the risks			to Commander Data?					MADDOX			Negligible.   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT ONE   13.8A   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA				(to Picard)			His basic research lacks the			specifics necessary to support			an experiment of this magnitude.					PICARD			Data is a valued member of my			bridge crew. Based on what I've			heard I cannot allow him to submit			to your experiment.					MADDOX			I thought this might be your			attitude, Captain.				(he removes a message				 disk from his pocket,				 and extends it to				 Picard)			Here are Starfleet's transfer			orders separating Commander Data			from the Enterprise, and			reassigning it to Starbase one-seven-three			under my command. Data, I'll			expect you in my office at nine			hundred hours tomorrow.	Focus on Picard as we:									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                             STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT TWO   14.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:9    INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	Admiral Nakamura on the screen. Picard eyes him with	some hostility.					NAKAMURA			Look, it's a transfer, like any			other transfer.					PICARD			No, it's not. This is one of my			key officers, and he's been			removed without consulting me.					NAKAMURA			I'm sorry about that, but			Commander Maddox's work in			robotics is considered critical			by Starfleet Command. Think			what's at stake here. If			Commander Maddox can succeed in			duplicating Noonien Soong's work			other captains on other ships			would have the advantage you now			enjoy: a Data on every bridge.			You don't want Data transferred,			fine. There's an easy solution.			Have him work with Commander			Maddox. Nakamura out.	Picard stares at the blank viewscreen, then rises and	paces the room. The DOOR CHIME SOUNDS arresting him in	his nervous preambulations.					PICARD			Come.	Data enters.					DATA			You sent for me, sir?	Picard returns to his desk, seats himself, and regards	Data intently.					PICARD			Please, sit down. We've got a			problem.   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT TWO   15.9    CONTINUED:					DATA			I find myself in agreement with			that assessment of the situation,			sir.					PICARD			Your service to this ship has been			exemplary. I don't want to lose			you.					DATA			I am pleased to hear you say so.			Thank you.					PICARD			There is a solution which presents			itself.					DATA			Yes, sir?					PICARD			Undergo the procedure, then the			transfer order becomes moot.					DATA			I will not submit to this			procedure.	Picard rises, and seats himself on the corner of the	desk, closing the distance with Data.					PICARD			Data, I understand your objections			to this procedure, but I also have			to consider Starfleet's interests.			If Commander Maddox is correct			there is a possibility that many			more beings such as yourself could			be constructed.					DATA			True, but possibility is a word			which can encompass any number			of outcomes -- good and bad.					PICARD			But if he's right, Starfleet would			be immeasurably enriched.   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT TWO   16.9    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			Captain, I am a Starfleet			officer. Can they force me to			do this?					PICARD			It's precisely because you are			a Starfleet officer that they can.			We take an oath to serve. In this			case this is the form your service			is taking.					DATA			Sir, Lieutenant La Forge's eyes			are far superior to human			biological eyes, true?					PICARD			Yes.					DATA			Then why are not all human			officers required to have their			eyes replaced with cybernetic			implants?	Picard is utterly at a loss for words. We can see the	confusion on his face as he struggles for an answer to	this unanswerable remark. Data rises with great	dignity.					DATA				(continuing)			I see. It is precisely because			I am not human.					PICARD			That will be all, Mister Data.				(jabs open the com				 on his desk)			Computer. Pull all relevant			Starfleet regulations concerning			officer transfers.					COMPUTER VOICE			Working.	Page after page of regulations begin to scroll across	the screen.

Picard enters. She	looks up in surprise.					PHILLIPA			My God, twice in as many days.					PICARD			I need your help.					PHILLIPA			An historic moment.					PICARD			I've been trying to make heads			or tails of this gibberish, and			it's finally defeated me. My			android officer has been			transferred so he can undergo a			highly dangerous procedure. I			want to stop it.					PHILLIPA			He can refuse to undergo this			procedure, but we can't stop the			transfer.					PICARD			Once Maddox has Data under his			control anything could happen.			I don't trust that man.					PHILLIPA			We agree to certain risks when			we join Starfleet.					PICARD				(pacing)			Acceptable risks, justified risks,			yes, but I can't accept this.			It's unfair and unjust. What			about his rights...					PHILLIPA			All this passion over a machine.					PICARD				(raising a warning				 finger)			Don't start. Is there an option?   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT TWO   18.10   CONTINUED:					PHILLIPA			There's always an option. He can			resign.	Phillipa suddenly rises and comes around the desk to	Picard. She is very close, her body language is one of	yearning, but her voice still has that flippant tone.					PHILLIPA				(continuing)			So you came to me for help.					PICARD				(stiff because he thinks				 she's taunting him)			Yes, I came to you. You're the			JAG officer in this sector. I had			to come to you.	He starts to leave.					PHILLIPA			Wait! I didn't mean it that way.			I'm... I'm glad that you thought			you could... well, come to me.					PICARD			Trust is too painful a word.					PHILLIPA			I wish things were different for			us.11   INT. DATA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	Data is packing. A handgrip lies open on the desk top.	There is a holocube on the top to the clothing. Data	triggers it, and a miniature of Tasha Yar stands on the	desk. He regards the image for a few seconds, then	removes a box from a desk drawer. Opens it and studies	his medals. Places it in the case. Finally he lifts	an antique bound book. As he replaces the book,	Maddox enters. Maddox lifts out the book, finds a	marker at the sonnet, looks surprised.   STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT TWO   19.11   CONTINUED:					MADDOX			"When in disgrace with fortune			  and men's eyes,			I all alone beweep my outcast			  state...

The paper falls away revealing an	antique book. Data reads from the binding.					DATA			The Dream of the Fire, by K'Ratak.			Thank you, Worf.					WORF			It was in the hands of the			Klingons that the novel attained			its full stature.					PULASKI			I couldn't disagree more, but			we'll save that argument for			another day.

Enter the			dangerous situations.					GUINAN			All those future Datas risking			their lives for the people who			created them.					PICARD				(very intent)			You said something earlier about			decisions today.					GUINAN			Having implications for the			future.					PICARD			Precedent! This case will set			the precedent for all the future			Datas. It will determine their			status, and they'll all be			property.					GUINAN			There is an ancient word for it -- slavery.					PICARD				(very excited)			Not a word we want back in our			vocabulary.	They each lift a glass and toast each other.					GUINAN			Good luck, sir.	They drink.22   INT. COURTROOM (OPTICAL)	Everyone in their original positions.  STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE  43.22   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(making his opening				 statement)			Commander Riker has dramatically			demonstrated to this court that			Lieutenant Commander Data is a			machine. Do we deny that? No.			But how is this relevant? We too			are machines, just machines of			a different type. Commander Riker			has continually reminded us that			Data was built by a human. We			do not deny that fact. But again			how is it relevant? Does			construction imply ownership?			Children are created from the			building blocks of their parents'			DNA. Are they property? We have			a chance in this hearing to			severely limit the boundaries			of freedom. And I think we			better be pretty damn careful			before we take so arrogant a step.			I call Lieutenant Commander Data			to the stand.	Data returns to the witness stand. Picard pulls from	beneath the table the android's travelcase. Places it	on the table, opens it.					PICARD				(continuing; lifts out				 the case of medals,				 and displays the				 contents)			What are these, please?					DATA			My medals.					PICARD			Why pack them? What logical			purpose do they serve?					DATA			I... I do not know, sir. None			I suppose. I just wanted them.			Is that vanity?  STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE  44.22   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD				(holding up the book				 of sonnets)			And this?					DATA			It was a gift from you, sir.					PICARD			You value it?					DATA			Yes, sir.					PICARD			Why?					DATA			It is a reminder of friendship			and service.					PICARD				(lifts out the holocube,				 and triggers it; Tasha				 stands before them)			And this? You have no portraits			of any other of your crewmates.			Why this person?					DATA			I would prefer not to answer that			question, sir. I gave my word.					PICARD			Mister Data, may I remind you, that			you are under oath.				(more gently now)			And under the circumstances, I			don't think Tasha would mind.					DATA				(swallowing convulsively				 several times)			She was important to me... we			were... intimate.	Phillipa is literally rocked back in her chair.					PICARD			I have no further questions of			this witness.  STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE  45.22   CONTINUED: (3)					PHILLIPA			Commander Riker, do you wish to			cross?					RIKER			I have no questions, your honor.					PICARD			I call to the stand Commander			Bruce Maddox as a hostile witness.	Riker and Maddox confer, then with a shrug Maddox seats	himself in the witness chair.					COMPUTER VOICE			Verify, Maddox, Bruce, Commander.			Current assignment, Chair of			Robotics, Federation Institute			of Technology. Major papers...					PICARD			Enough. Suffice it to say, he's			an expert.				(right up in his face)			Commander Maddox, it is your			contention that Data is not a			sentient being and therefore not			entitled to those rights reserved			for all other life-forms in this			Federation?					MADDOX			Data is not sentient, no.					PICARD			Why, Commander?					MADDOX			Because Data is a piece of			outstanding engineering and			programming.					PICARD			What is required for sentience?					MADDOX			Intelligence, self awareness,			consciousness.					PICARD			Do you know what sentience is,			Commander?  STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE  46.22   CONTINUED: (4)					MADDOX			Of course.					PICARD			Excellent. Then you can enlighten			the rest of us.	All of Picard's delivery needs to be sharp and	staccato.					PICARD				(continuing; right in				 Maddox's face)			Prove to this court that I'm			sentient.					MADDOX				(to Phillipa)			This is absurd!					PICARD			Why? Because you can't do it?					MADDOX			No, it's just pointless. We all			know you're sentient.					PICARD			So I'm sentient, but Data isn't?					MADDOX			That's right.					PICARD			Why?					MADDOX			Well... well, you're self aware.					PICARD			Ah, the second ingredient. But			let's deal with the first			requirement. Is Data			intelligent?					MADDOX			Yes.					PICARD			Why?  STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE  47.22   CONTINUED: (5)					MADDOX			It has the ability to learn and			understand, and to cope with new			situations.					PICARD			Like this hearing. What about			self awareness. What does that			mean? Why am I self aware?					MADDOX			Because you are conscious of your			existence and actions. You're			aware of yourself and your own			ego.					PICARD			Data, what are you doing now?					DATA			I am taking part in a legal			hearing to determine my rights			and status. Am I property or			person?					PICARD			And what's at stake?					DATA			My right to choose. Perhaps my			very life.					PICARD			My rights. My status. My right			to choose. My life. He seems			pretty damn self aware to me.			Well, Commander Maddox, I'm			waiting.					MADDOX			This is exceedingly difficult...					PICARD			Do you like Data?					MADDOX				(completely taken aback)			I don't know it well enough to			like or dislike it.					PICARD			But you admire him?  STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE  48.22   CONTINUED: (6)					MADDOX			Oh yes, it's an outstanding --					PICARD				(interrupting)			Piece of engineering and			programming. Yes, you've said			that. You've devoted your life			to the study of cybernetics in			general?					MADDOX			Yes.					PICARD			And Data in particular?					MADDOX			Yes.					PICARD			And now you're proposing to			dismantle him.					MADDOX			So I can rebuild him and construct			more!					PICARD			How many more?					MADDOX			Hundreds, thousands. There's no			limit.					PICARD			And do what with them?					MADDOX			Use them.					PICARD			How?					MADDOX			As effective units on Federation			ships. As replacements for			humans in dangerous situations.			So much is closed to us because			of our fragility. But they...  STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE  49.22   CONTINUED: (7)					PICARD				(interrupting; he picks				 up an object and throws				 it down a disposal				 chute)			Are expendable.					MADDOX			It sounds harsh but to some			extent, yes.					PICARD			Are you expendable, Commander			Maddox? Never mind. A single			Data is a curiosity, a wonder,			but a thousand Datas, doesn't that			become a new race? And aren't			we going to be judged as a species			about how we treat these			creations? If they're expendable,			disposable, aren't we? What is			Data?					MADDOX			What? I don't understand.					PICARD			What... is... he?					MADDOX				(angry now and hostile)			A machine!					PICARD			Is he? Are you sure?					MADDOX			Yes!					PICARD			But he's met two of your three			criteria for sentience, and we			haven't addressed the third. So			we might find him meeting your			third criterion, and then what			is he?					MADDOX				(driven to his limit)			I don't know. I don't know!       STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE      50.22A  ANOTHER ANGLE	Reaction shot from Phillipa.					PICARD			He doesn't know.				(to Phillipa)			Do you? That's the decision			you're facing. Your honor, a			courtroom is a crucible. In it			we burn away the egos, the selfish			desires, the half-truths, until			we're left with the pure product			-- a truth -- for all time.			Sooner or later it's going to			happen. This man or others like			him are going to succeed in			replicating Data. And then we			have to decide -- what are they?			And how will we treat these			creations of our genius? The			decision you reach here today			stretches far beyond this android			and this courtroom. It will			reveal the kind of a people we			are. And what				(points to Data)			... they are going to be. Do you			condemn then to slavery?			Starfleet was founded to seek out			new life.				(indicating Data)			Well, there he sits, your honor,			waiting on our decision. You have			a chance to make law. Well, let's			make a good one. Let us be wise.					PHILLIPA			This case touches on metaphysics,			and that's the province of			philosophers and poets. Not			confused jurists who don't have			the answers. But sometimes we			have to make a stab in the dark,			and speak to the future. Is Data			a machine? Absolutely. Is he			our property? No... (this will			be rewritten with additions).	The courtroom erupts in joy. Phillipa starts to leave	then crosses to Picard.       STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE      51.22A  CONTINUED:					PHILLIPA				(continuing)			You see, sometimes it works.	Picard watches her walk away, conflicting emotions	washing across his face.22B  ANOTHER ANGLE	Data walks to Maddox who is looking confused, guilty	and sad.					DATA			Continue your work, Commander,			and when you are ready I will			still be here.					MADDOX			You'd be willing after what I've			put you through?					DATA			Yes, it would be a less lonely			universe if there were more of			my kind.	Phillipa comes up unnoticed by Data and Maddox.					MADDOX				(watching Data walk				 away)			He's remarkable.					PHILLIPA			You didn't call him "it."	Maddox looks startled, then smiles.23   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)	Riker sitting alone in the darkness staring out the	windows as the stars rush past. Data enters. Riker	does not turn.					DATA			Sir, there is a celebration on			the Holodeck.					RIKER			I have no right to be there.       STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE      52.23   CONTINUED:					DATA				(edging closer)			Because you failed in your task?					RIKER				(slewing around in his				 chair at that)			No, God, no. Data, I came this			close to winning.	Riker indicates a bare inch with thumb and forefinger.					DATA			Yes, sir.					RIKER				(in agony just				 remembering)			I could have cost you your life!					DATA				(moving in, and seating				 himself opposite Riker)			Yes, that is true, but			Commander... Will, I have learned			from your experience.					RIKER			What could you have possibly			learned from this kind of ordeal?					DATA			That at times one must deny their			nature, sacrifice their own			personal beliefs to protect			another. Is it not true that had			you refused to prosecute, Captain			Louvois would have ruled summarily			against me?					RIKER			Yes.					DATA			That action injured you, and saved			me. I will not forget.					RIKER				(taking his hand)			You're a wise man, my friend.       STAR TREK: "The Measure of a Man" - 12/14/88 - ACT FIVE      53.23   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			Not yet sir, but with your help			I am learning.	Riker clasps Data's shoulder, squeezes, as they shake	hands, and we:									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
