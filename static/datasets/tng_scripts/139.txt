SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	moves along at warp speed.2    INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	RIKER has cleared a space on his desk and set up a	little work station. He has a bowl and several	strange-looking eggs. Some smaller containers with	other ingredients and condiments for what appears to	be an omelet. He breaks the last egg into the bowl	and whips them with a jerry-rigged whisk. He is	obviously enjoying himself. The CHIME SOUNDS.					RIKER			Come in.	The door opens; it's DATA and GEORDI carrying what look	like a homemade Bunsen burner and a frying pan.					RIKER				(continuing)			Excellent. Exactly what I need.	Before the door closes, PULASKI appears, carrying	something.					RIKER				(continuing)			Well, Doctor, and bearing gifts?					PULASKI			Ale from Ennan Six... your omelets			deserve no less.	Again before the door can close, WORF appears and	follows them into the room.3    THE TABLE	Riker sets up the "Bunsen-type burner," ignites it,	heats the pan and pours in the beaten eggs, while Data	watches.      STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - TEASER      2.3    CONTINUED:					DATA			This is not an efficient method			for the preparation of sustenance.					RIKER			You're right, Data. The ship's			computer is much more efficient,			but it lacks the subtlety needed			for great cooking. It mixes the			ingredients to precise			measurements. There's no flair,			no individuality, and Data, as			we both know... inspiration and			flair are the difference between			artistry and mere competence.					PULASKI			For much of the history of			mankind, the breaking of bread			was a sign of friendship and			community. Something we have			gotten away from in the			twenty-fourth century.				(re: Riker and the				 whisk)			You have a practiced hand,			Commander.					RIKER			I have my father to thank for			that.					PULASKI			Oh, your father liked to cook?					RIKER			No, he hated it. It was a chore			left to me.					WORF			It is my understanding that in			most human families, the woman			shares in the cooking.					RIKER			There were only the two of us.			I never knew my mother. She died			when I was very young.4    PULASKI	as she pours the ale -      STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - TEASER      3.5    DATA	as he takes a sip.					GEORDI			Where did you get the eggs?					RIKER			During our last stop.					GEORDI				(with surprise)			At Starbase seventy-three?					RIKER			Yes.6    SCENE	as Riker dishes up the food. And they all sit down	to eat, all eager to enjoy the meal. Geordi is the	first to taste it; it clearly does not suit his palate.					GEORDI			What kind of eggs did you say			these are?	As Riker takes a bite:					RIKER			'Owon.	From Geordi's expression it's apparent the eggs are	lacking. Riker and Pulaski both react to the uneatable	food.					RIKER				(continuing)			A cook's only as good as his			ingredients.	Then they look over at Worf, who is enjoying it	immensely.					WORF			Delicious.	Something to end the scene.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Commander Riker...      STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - TEASER      4.6    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Yes, Captain.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Would you join me on the bridge?					RIKER			On my way.	Without having to be told, Data and Worf leave with	him. Worf pausing to take one last forkful of omelet.7    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Riker, Data and Worf ENTER and take their positions.					PICARD			We have picked up an automated			signal from a Federation			shuttlecraft.	Riker looks surprised and confused.					RIKER			A shuttle? Out here?! How is			that possible? We're the first			manned Federation vessel to enter			this area.					PICARD			Apparently not.					RIKER			So what's a shuttle doing out this			far? And where's the mother ship?					PICARD			I don't know.					WORF			Sensors indicate there is at least			one life-form on board the			shuttle. Humanoid.					PICARD			Perhaps someone to answer your			questions, Number One. Open			hailing frequencies.      STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - TEASER      5.7    CONTINUED:					WORF			Captain, the shuttle is without			power. Communication is not			possible.					RIKER			Set course to intercept.					DATA			Estimate intercept in three			minutes.8    OMITTED9    EXT.

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	comes out of warp.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 42679.2.			While traversing an unexplored			section of the galaxy en route			to the Endicor system, a			Federation shuttlecraft has quite			suddenly appeared -- virtually out			of nowhere. There are no other			ships in the vicinity -- and no			indications whence it came nor			how it got out here.11   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	The bridge is as before.					WORF			We are closing on shuttlecraft.					PICARD			On screen.12   ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	as the image changes and the shuttle appears -- it is	out of control -- cartwheeling through space.					RIKER			Magnify.	The image changes again. The shuttle now appears in	close-up.					RIKER				(continuing)			Prepare to lock tractor beam.13   OMITTED      STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE      7.14   INT.

SHUTTLE BAY TWO (OPTICAL)	as the Enterprise closes with the violently spinning	shuttlecraft.16   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	as before...					DATA			Locking tractor beam.17   INT. SHUTTLE BAY TWO (OPTICAL)	as the tractor beam shoots out from the Enterprise and	grabs the shuttlecraft and stabilizes it.18   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	as before...					DATA			The tractor beam has been locked.					PICARD			Number One.	Riker is out of his chair and heading for the	turbolift.      STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE      8.18   CONTINUED:					RIKER			Worf -- you're with me.					PICARD			Doctor Pulaski, you are needed			in Shuttle Bay Two.					PULASKI'S COM VOICE			I have been monitoring. I am			on my way.19   INT. SHUTTLE BAY TWO (OPTICAL)	The doors have been opened. The shuttle, held firmly	by the tractor beam, is being pulled toward the	Enterprise, as Riker and Worf ENTER.20   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as the shuttle moves closer. An n.d. crewmember, at a	control panel near the door, attaches a second tractor	beam, which automatically releases the first -- stronger	one -- and transfers control to the n.d. operator.21   RIKER AND WORF	They move closer as the shuttlecraft is pulled on	board.22   SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)	as it settles on the floor.	The doors are closing as the tractor beam disengages.23   SCENE	As Riker and Worf move closer, Doctor Pulaski ENTERS	the Shuttle Bay with an assistant.					RIKER			Well, it's a Federation shuttle			all right.					WORF			Yet, there are no Federation			vessels or bases in this area.	Riker steps closer.      STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE      9.24   RIKER AND SHUTTLE	He reads the registration number. On the other side	of the craft, Pulaski and two n.d. crewmembers are	working to open the shuttle door.					RIKER				(reading)			NCC one-seven-zero-one-D -- USS			Enterprise, shuttle number			five.	He turns in shock and stares at Worf. Riker looks back	at the registration number to be sure he read it	correctly. Riker then looks to the other side of the	Shuttle Bay...25   SCENE (OPTICAL)	... to another shuttlecraft, identical in design to the	one which was just brought on board, and carrying the	exact same number.					RIKER				(reading)			NCC one-seven-zero-one-D -- USS			Enterprise shuttle number			five.					WORF			How is this possible?26   OTHER SIDE OF SHUTTLE	The crewmembers get the door open. Pulaski starts to	enter, then freezes. Pulaski calls out:					PULASKI			Commander! Come here!27   RIKER AND WORF	The urgency in her voice sends Riker and Worf quickly	around to the other side of the shuttle where:28   ANOTHER ANGLE	Pulaski steps back to allow Riker to look in.     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE     10.29   RIKER	Instantly he understands the reason for Pulaski's	reaction.30   SHUTTLECRAFT	Slumped over the controls is CAPTAIN JEAN-LUC PICARD.	Unconscious, but otherwise exactly the same as the man	we just left on the bridge!					RIKER				(he touches his				 communicator)			Captain?					PICARD'S COM VOICE			What is it, Number One?					RIKER			Captain, are you on the bridge?					PICARD'S COM VOICE				(irritated)			Where else would I be?					RIKER			Right now, I think you had better			be in Shuttle Bay Two.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Why? What is it?					RIKER			This you had better see for			yourself and, Captain, bring			Commander Data.31   ANOTHER ANGLE - SHUTTLE BAY TWO	Picard and Data ENTER. Pulaski is in the shuttle	checking P2's condition. The tension level in the	room is very high. Without being called, TROI	instinctively ENTERS the Shuttle Bay.32   PICARD	as he moves closer he sees what has them all so	concerned.     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE     11.33   INTERCUT	the others, all waiting to see how Picard is going to	react.34   PICARD	moves closer, wanting to be certain his eyes are	telling him the truth. Riker moves up next to him.	For a beat they both watch Pulaski as she does her	medical checks.35   SCENE	Data is nearby, waiting to enter the shuttle as soon as	Pulaski is clear.					RIKER			We have been in a lot of bizarre			situations, but nothing like this.	Picard's response comes out as a grunt. Seeing a	duplicate of himself, in a duplicate of an Enterprise	shuttlecraft, has put Picard and the others under	enormous strain, so much so that words come slowly. No	one knows what to say, and all are waiting for some	explanation about what's going on. This all plays off	Picard, who is the most involved. In a strange way the	crew avoids making eye contract with Picard.					PICARD			What's his condition?36   SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)	Pulaski completes her scan.					PULASKI			The life signs are confusing.			I get a strong heartbeat, but the			rhythm is off.					PICARD			Has he been injured?					PULASKI			No signs of trauma.					PICARD			Then why is he unconscious? What			happened to him?     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE     12.36   CONTINUED:					PULASKI			I can't say.	As she scans P2's head she gently touches his face, as	if double checking her readings.					PULASKI				(continuing)			The readings from his brain waves			are very... strange.	Little alarm bells go off for Picard.					PICARD			Strange? In what way? Non-human?			Artificial?					PULASKI			No -- neither. They are just out			of phase.					PICARD			Can you revive him?					PULASKI			I won't attempt it until he's in			Sickbay.				(she holds the look for				 a beat, then:)			Let's get him there.	Pulaski and her medical team remove P2.37   PICARD AND TROI (OPTICAL)	Both are confounded.					PICARD			Counselor.     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE     13.37   CONTINUED:					TROI			I have never felt anything quite			like this so it is difficult to			put into words.				(she pauses to gather				 her thoughts)			That person is you. What I mean,			the person we are looking at is			as much Jean-Luc Picard as the			person I am standing next to;			beyond that there's very little			of which I am sure. I will have			to wait until he is conscious			before knowing more.38   SCENE					PICARD			Data, we have to know what is on			the shuttle's logs.					DATA			Yes, sir.	Data enters the damaged shuttle.39   INT./EXT. SHUTTLE	Data takes the command position and attempts to	activate the system.					DATA			Both primary and reserve power			has been drained from the shuttle.			I am going to have to connect			to the Enterprise in order to			activate the shuttle's systems.					RIKER			Lieutenant La Forge -- report to			Shuttle Bay Two.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			I'm on my way.					PICARD			Number One, I'll be in Sickbay.			Keep me informed.     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE     14.39   CONTINUED:					RIKER				(indicating an unusual				 burn on the skin of				 the shuttle)			Did you see this, Captain?	Picard steps over to the shuttle and examines the burn.					PICARD			It looks like the kind of damage			caused by an antimatter explosion.					RIKER			Yes, the shuttle must have been			just out of range.					PICARD				(urgent)			Data, I need those logs.				(to Troi)			Counselor.	As Picard and Troi EXIT:					RIKER			We'll be on the bridge.	He and Worf EXIT as Geordi ARRIVES.39A  INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Riker and Worf ENTER and go to their stations.					RIKER			Resume course and speed.				(to Worf)			Scanners at maximum range.					WORF			Maximum range.39B  EXT.

Filling the shuttle with	sparks.41   DATA (OPTICAL)	neither affected nor distracted by the chaos around	him, calmly shuts down the unit.					GEORDI			What happened?					DATA			The polarity was not			compatible.					GEORDI			Not possible, the connection is			idiot proof.					DATA			The power requirements of the			shuttle do not match the			Enterprise. We are going to need			a variable phase inverter, to			align the power from the			Enterprise to the circuits of the			shuttle.					GEORDI			Data, what do you think is going			on?

CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE SICKBAY	Picard and Troi are approaching Sickbay.					PICARD			This smells like a set-up.					TROI			A trap?					PICARD				(nods, yes)			If it is me, me from where? And			why in a shuttle? There is			nothing about this which is random			or happenstance. Look beneath			the boards, Counselor; I expect			something foul and familiar to			crawl out.	Picard holds her look for a beat, then turns and ENTERS	Sickbay.45   INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)	They have placed P2 in the center of Sickbay. Pulaski	is doing her medical work-ups.					PULASKI			We have just started doing a			complete work-up. The vital signs			are distorted. Some of the			indicators are totally depressed,			others are fluctuating wildly.			I can't explain any of it. But			he is alive, and I don't think			he's in any immediate danger.	She activates a forcefield, which briefly appears as	a restraining device.					PULASKI				(continuing)			The restraints are for his own			protection.					PICARD			Have you been able to determine			why he is still unconscious?     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE     16A.45   CONTINUED:					PULASKI			I have been able to rule out head			injury -- otherwise there is no			apparent cause.					PICARD			Wake him.     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE     17.45   CONTINUED: (2)	She touches the hypospray to his neck. Suddenly all of	the indicators fall to zero. Pulaski quickly adjusts	her hypospray and gives P2 another injection. While	they watch, the indicators return to their previous	readings.					PICARD				(continuing)			What happened?					PULASKI			Apparently a normal stimulant had			the opposite effect. I'll have			to try something else.	She steps over to a counter to prepare a different	injection. Picard moves slightly closer to himself.46   INT. SHUTTLE BAY TWO	Geordi and Data are working together to synchronize the	power from the Enterprise with the circuits of the	shuttlecraft.					GEORDI			There... that should give you			something. Making this power			adjustment is very tricky. By			all rights, this connection should			overload all the shuttle's			circuits.	Data steps over to the shuttle control position.					DATA			Perhaps you had better step back			out of the way.	Geordi responds.					GEORDI			Remember you're not indestructible			yourself.	Data again attempts to activate the systems.47   SHUTTLE	The lights on the control panel come on, then die out.     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE     17A.47   CONTINUED:					DATA			Increase the power.	The lights come back.					DATA				(continuing)			Adjust the invert two percent			positive.	The lights dim.					GEORDI			That's the correct decision, but			it's having the opposite effect.					DATA			Yes.					GEORDI			There is nothing I can think of			which could cause such a radical			change in this circuit.					DATA			Adjust the invert two percent			negative.	The lights glow brighter and hold.					GEORDI			Got it.

His face is a mask of	terror, pain and fear. His head rolls back and he	tries to scream, but no sound comes. As he looks	around, his movements have a strange stuttering	quality.53   PICARD	He reacts to seeing himself as he has never felt, nor	ever thought he would feel, out of control and	impotent.54   PULASKI	She moves to comfort P2, but his flaying hands hold her	off. His movements come in a series of stutters. He's	here - in this Sickbay, on this ship, but if as though	he were in another dimension as well.     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO     20.55   PICARD	Troi is close beside him.

His mouth is open --	but still there is no sound.57   PICARD	The terror of seeing himself in such a condition. A	little sound comes from him... It's primal, in response	to what he sees and the anguish he feels from his	otherself's helpless condition.58   SCENE	Pulaski responds to seeing a patient in this condition,	steps up to touch the hypospray to P2's neck.					PICARD			No!	The word explodes from him.					PULASKI			It's a only a sedative.					PICARD			I know what it is... don't sedate			him.

There is a lot of buffeting -- both	the shuttle and the Enterprise are being thrown	about.68   PICARD	He is very intent on the scene before him.     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO     23.69   SCREEN (OPTICAL)	The turmoil around the Enterprise increases. Then,	without a sound... the Enterprise is literally torn	apart, by a great, yet unseen force.

There			is not enough information upon			which I can base a hypothesis.					GEORDI			Well, the shuttle apparently came			from somewhere up ahead. Rather			than continuing on this course,			perhaps we should stop here and			let whatever is out there come			and find us.					RIKER			I think it's already too late for			that.					GEORDI			Are you saying that stopping,			turning left, or right, or even			reversing course, is pointless?					RIKER			When we brought the shuttle and			the other Picard on board, we			committed ourselves to a sequence			of events which may be			unalterable.					PICARD			Yes, this isn't a rock in the road			which once seen can be avoided.			It's much more complex.     STAR TREK: "Time Squared" - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO     25.71   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			There is the theory of the			moebius, a twist in the fabric of			space where time becomes a loop			from which there is no escape.					GEORDI			So, when we reach that moment --			whatever happened will happen			again... The Enterprise will be			destroyed, the "other Picard" sent			back to meet with us and do it			all over again.				(he shudders)			That sounds like someone's			definition of hell.					RIKER			I know this much -- we can't avoid			the future.					PICARD			Agreed.

She is watching him	intently.					TROI			Captain, I am able to feel more			from him now. Much of his			emotions are still a jumble,			but...	She steps even closer. Her eyes shut as she	concentrates. P2 flinches in the same stuttering way.	His body jerks back. His face contorts.	His hands reach out and grab Troi.
