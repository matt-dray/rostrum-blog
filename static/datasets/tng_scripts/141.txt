Previous unmanned			probes have recorded unusual			levels of geological activity			in all five planetary systems.			I am hoping the Enterprise will			find the answer to this engima.2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	RIKER is in the command position. WORF and DATA are at	their respective stations. Supernumeraries at other	positions.					DATA			Commander, I have been reviewing			the unmanned probe scans. In the			past one hundred and fifty years,			the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema			has shattered, forming an asteroid			belt.					RIKER			I'd call that geological			instability.					WORF			Is there any indication that this			is the work of an unknown			intelligence?        STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - REV. 2/13/89 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:					RIKER			I think this is geology, not			malevolence. These planets live			fast and die hard. The question			is why.3    INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)	PICARD and TROI come walking down the corridor toward	the Holodeck doors. He is dressed for riding in	breeches, high boots, sweater. Hunt cap beneath his	arm, gloves, whip.					PICARD			You're sure you won't reconsider?					TROI			No, I'll watch you and be			impressed.					PICARD			An optimistic vote of confidence			from the non-rider.					TROI			I've never thought of you as			particularly an animal person.					PICARD			Small animals, no, but horses --	They reach the Holodeck doors, and he steps to the	computer panel.					PICARD				(continuing)			Computer, program Holodeck for			a woodland setting with a bridle			path and an appropriate mount.					COMPUTER VOICE			Type of mount? Andorian Zabathu,			Klingon Sark --					PICARD				(impatiently)			A horse, an Earth horse.					COMPUTER VOICE			Breed?       STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" -- REV. 2/21/89 - TEASER       3.3    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Arabian.				(to Troi)			The Arabs believed that Allah			gathered the south wind and made			the horse.					TROI			On the Holodeck we've made that			legend come true.					PICARD			I like that. Oh yes, computer,			English tack, and I will control			the animal myself.					COMPUTER VOICE			Acknowledged.	The doors open, and there is the scene. The horse,	already saddled and bridled, stands quietly in a glade	in the trees tethered to an old-fashioned horse head	hitching post. Picard and Troi ENTER.3A   EXT. MEADOW	Picard and Troi cross to the horse, and Picard allows	it to smell his hand. He rubs her between the eyes,	and straightens the forelock.					PICARD			Hello, my beauty.					TROI			So you like horses for the			romance?					PICARD			It goes deeper than that. A fine			war mare would sleep in a			bedouin's tent, carry him into			battle, feed his children with			her milk. There is a bond which			forms from mutual need.	Picard inspects a forefoot.					TROI			Now I understand. You don't want			the comfort of a pet. You want			a companion.          STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - 2/10/89 - TEASER          4.3A   CONTINUED:	She reflects for a moment, looks a little wistful.					TROI				(continuing)			I had a Betazoid kitten once. My			mother and the cat reacted...			badly to one another.	She pauses as if considering how to phrase the words.	Then decides to just say it.					TROI				(continuing)			Captain, my mother and I share			a bond. She is going through a			difficult time, and I may need			to be with her.					PICARD			If you want leave, you need only			ask.					TROI			Thank you, sir, I appreciate that.					PICARD				(indicating the horse)			You're sure you won't try? It's			a good way to relax. We can get			you something quiet and gentle.					TROI			No, no. I prefer a mode of			transportation that doesn't have			a mind of its own.					PICARD			Strange. I should have thought			that Betazoids would be			outstanding animal trainers.					TROI			We become too involved in the			thoughts and shifting passions			of the beast. We lose our way			and become swept up in			emotionalism.	Picard checks the girth and the length of the	stirrups.          STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - 2/10/89 - TEASER          5.3A   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			I should think the shifting			passions of...				(he taps his chest)			... this beast would be			far more terrifying.	Picard gathers up the reins and prepares to mount.	Then RIKER'S COM VOICE interrupts.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Captain.					PICARD			Yes, Number One?					RIKER			We've entered the first system.			I think you might want to come			to the bridge.					PICARD			Something interesting?					RIKER			Spectacular and a little			terrifying.					PICARD			On my way.				(he pats the horse's				 neck)			Later, old girl.4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Riker, Worf and Data at their stations. Picard ENTERS	(back in uniform). On the main viewscreen is the image	of a planet that is in the throes of a violent	geological upheaval. The various tectonic plates are	outlined in red as if the planet is literally tearing	itself apart.					RIKER			This is our first long-range			reading, extremely high			magnification.					PICARD			Quite impressive.          STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - 2/10/89 - TEASER          6.4    CONTINUED:					RIKER			And deadly.

Troi and	PULASKI ENTER and look to Picard.					PICARD			This is Commander Riker's meeting.					RIKER			I need your advice and			recommendations. I was given the			responsibility of overseeing			Wesley's education. To further			that goal I want to put him in			command of the planetary mineral			surveys.					PULASKI			This is a big job with a lot of			responsibility.					RIKER			The game's not big enough if it			doesn't scare you a little.					GEORDI			To do the job, Wesley's going to			need a team. It takes command			presence to lead. Is he ready			for that?					TROI			Leadership grows from			self-confidence which is also			part of a Starfleet officer's			education.					PICARD			All of this is true, but there			is an old horse trainer's adage			about putting too much weight on			a young back -- we don't want him			to break under the pressure.       STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - REV. 2/13/89 - ACT ONE       8.6    CONTINUED:					PULASKI			We seem to be shifting the focus			here. Are we talking about a			young officer on the fast track			to the Academy or are we talking			about guiding a young man through			adolescence and into adulthood?					RIKER			Both.					TROI			You can't guide someone into			adulthood. The experiences are			unique to each person. Whether			Wes succeeds or fails, he will			learn from the experience.					PULASKI			I agree. I'm just questioning			the speed at which we're moving.					GEORDI			You think we're pushing him too			hard?					PULASKI			It's a valid concern.					PICARD			Tempering is done in extremes.					PULASKI			He's a boy, not a sword.					PICARD			Who will someday be a man and			need a fine edge that will hold,			that won't dull at the first			touch of resistance.					RIKER			Sooner or later he's got to feel			the burden of command.6A   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Worf has the bridge; he is seated in the captain's	chair. WESLEY is at Ops.          STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - 2/10/89 - ACT ONE          9.6A   CONTINUED:					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Mister Crusher to the Observation			Lounge.	Wesley rises, and we follow him up the ramp toward the	Observation Lounge doors.6B   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Wesley ENTERS. He checks slightly when he sees this	array of brass all staring at him.					RIKER			Wesley, I'm placing you in			command of the planetary mineral			surveys.					WESLEY			Sir! Um... thank you, sir.					RIKER			You may not thank me once you see			how much work it entails.			Assemble your team, and take a			look at the records on the Drema			quadrant. We've got a mystery			to solve here.					WESLEY			Yes, sir. A team, sir?	Riker just nods.					PICARD			Ensign, this is a serious			responsibility.					WESLEY			I know, sir.					PICARD			These officers are here to assist			you. Not judge, but help. I			suggest you use them; they are			a valuable resource. And by the			way, I have more respect for an			officer who knows when to admit			ignorance and ask a question than			one who, out of pride, will			blunder blindly forward.       STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - REV. 2/14/89 - ACT ONE       10.6B   CONTINUED:					WESLEY			I understand.					RIKER			You're dismissed, Mister Crusher.	Wesley starts to leave, then turns back and looks from	Riker to Picard.					WESLEY			I'll try not to disappoint you	Picard merely grunts noncommittally.7    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Data is running scans at Science One. The area around	his feet is cluttered with a CRT screen, a panel at his	feet is open, and a circuit board is out. Worf steps	gingerly through the mess.					WORF			Is this part of your regular			duties?					DATA			No, a personal project. I have			just reset the sensors to scan			for frequencies outside their			usual range.					WORF			Such as?					DATA			The dips and peaks of the galaxy's			magnetic field, organic molecules			in nebular clouds, energetic			cosmic rays.					WORF			Interesting. Would these scans			also detect artificial			transmissions as well as naturally			occurring signals?					DATA			Of course.					WORF			Good.       STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - Rev. 2/22/89 - ACT ONE       11.7    CONTINUED:					DATA			Those signals are very faint and			difficult to distinguish from			background noise, which is why			I am boosting the power.	Worf starts back to his station, crashes into a pile	of isolinear chips, and almost takes a header over the	control board.					DATA				(continuing)			I will be removing this equipment			to my quarters.	Worf is not happy. He glowers, and snarls out:					WORF			Good!8    INT. CORRIDOR	Troi and Riker are walking together. They cross an	intersection, and Wesley spots them. He runs to catch	up, a PADD gripped hard in one hand.					WESLEY			Hi, may I walk with you? I need			a little advice.					TROI			Yes.					RIKER			And it's free.					WESLEY			Walking or advice?					RIKER			Both.					WESLEY			It's about my team. I'm			considering so many factors I'm			confusing myself.					TROI			What have you done so far?       STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - Rev. 2/22/89 - ACT ONE       12.8    CONTINUED:					WESLEY			Broken down the task and picked			the best people in those			disciplines.					RIKER			Who have you got so far?					WESLEY			Prixus for mineralogy and			metallurgy, Alans and Hildebrant,			volcanology and geo-mechanics,			and I want Davies for geo-chemistry,			but --	Wesley breaks off. They stop walking, and Riker and	Troi wait for a beat.					TROI			But they're all older than			you?					WESLEY			Yeah, it makes me feel awkward.			And what about compatibility --					RIKER				(interrupting)			Completely irrelevant. They're			professionals. And if there are			personality conflicts, you resolve			them. You're in charge.					WESLEY			So you not only have to understand			the job, you have to be a ship's			counselor.					TROI			Sometimes.	Wesley looks at them both for an instant, then nods.					WESLEY			Well, thanks.	He walks away and they watch him go.      STAR TREK: "Pen PALS" -- REV. 2/15/89 - ACT ONE      13.9    EXT.

I believe			the volatility of these planets			originated in the primordial gas			cloud which formed them five			billion years ago.10   INT. DATA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	Data's desk is cluttered with the black boxes which are	boosting and filtering his experimental scans. There	is a keyboard. Data is fiddling with his equipment	when suddenly there is a signal.					DATA			Computer, identify.					COMPUTER VOICE			Sensors indicate low-level R.F.			waves.					DATA			Is there a pattern?					COMPUTER VOICE			Affirmative.	There is a SOUND OF STATIC and under it all a repeating	tonal pattern.					DATA			Naturally occurring?					COMPUTER VOICE			Negative.					DATA			Key universal translator.					COMPUTER VOICE			Unable to comply.

DAVIES, a man of some thirty years, sits	in a chair and examines a rock sample, runs one of our	ever-useful black boxes across it. It VANISHES in a	flare of rainbow colors. The doors open, and Wesley	ENTERS. He is brisk and confident.					WESLEY			Ensign Davies?					DAVIES			You got him.					WESLEY			Wesley Crusher.	They shake hands.         STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - 2/21/89 - ACT ONE         15.11   CONTINUED					WESLEY				(continuing)			I've been put in charge of the			planetary survey, and I'd like			to have you on the team.					DAVIES			Sounds great. Who else is on it?					WESLEY			Prixus and Hildebrant and Alans.					DAVIES			It's a shame you didn't talk to			me first. Personal opinion, but			I like to break up married teams.					WESLEY			Oh, I hadn't thought about that.					DAVIES			Don't worry, they'll probably work			out fine.	Wesley starts for the door.					DAVIES				(continuing)			And if you need any help, just			give me a signal and I'll take			over for you. We don't want you			getting too beat up on your first			command.	The tone is kindly, but Wesley's confidence is being	slowly eroded by all the good advice and kindly	protection.

The quality is as if a dragonfly	developed bipedally. Eyes can be faceted or not. She	is coughing.	Data turns. She freezes when she sees the Android,	then shrinks back in terror.	She bolts for the exit. Data leaps after her and grabs	her by the shoulders.					DATA			Sarjenka, wait!	She struggles violently in his grasp.					DATA				(continuing)			Do not be afraid. I am Data.	She stares at him in dawning wonder.

Fright washes	across her face.					SARJENKA			What are we going to do?	Data considers. There is another tremor, and Sarjenka	almost loses her footing. Data steadies her. He has	evaluated all the available information and there is	only one alternative. He taps his insignia.					DATA			Enterprise, two to beam up.             STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - 2/10/89 - ACT FOUR             43.32   CONTINUED: (3)					SARJENKA			Where are we going?	Data points upward.					SARJENKA				(continuing; thrilled)			To the stars?					DATA			Yes.	He positions the child, and they DEMATERIALIZE, as we:									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                                      STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" - 2/10/89 - ACT FIVE             44.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:33   INT.

The planet	is on the main viewscreen.					WORF			Sir, we are three minutes from			resonator launch.					PICARD				(to Riker)			Where is he?					RIKER			He'll be here.	Right on cue the doors of the aft turbolift open.	Picard and Riker rise and turn. Riker's expression	of relief turns to consternation as he and Picard stare	at the child with Data. Picard very slowly turns his	head to regard his first officer. There is a world	of frustration in the glance.					PICARD			He has brought that child aboard			my ship and onto my bridge.					RIKER			I'm sure Data will have a very			good explanation.					DATA			She was frightened and did not			want to be left alone					PICARD			Mister Data, would you kindly			assume your station.	Picard nods to Troi and gestures toward Sarjenka.					PICARD				(continuing)			Counselor, escort her to Sickbay.	Troi starts up the ramp, and Sarjenka shrinks even	closer to Data. She is in a very strange place, among	strangers who look hideously ugly to her, and there	is this gruff man who is angry with her and angry with	her friend Data.          STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" -- REV. 2/21/89 - ACT FIVE          46.34   CONTINUED: (2)					TROI				(reaching the pair)			It's all right, nobody's going			to hurt you.	Troi holds out her hand to Sarjenka.					TROI				(continuing)			We'll go and get a treat, and --					SARJENKA			NO!					DATA			Captain, I will not allow her to			be in the way.	Sarjenka is beating at Troi's hand as Troi reaches for	her and twining around Data like vines on a tree. Data	is very rattled by this. Everyone's attention is on	this little psychodrama and not on their stations.					WORF			Two minutes to resonator launch.					TROI			Little one, hush, it's all right.					SARJENKA				(interrupting, very				 shrill)			NO! Leave me alone! I want Data!	Troi catches one of Sarjenka's flailing hands. Troi	continues murmuring soothing endearments, but Sarjenka	is having none of it. She bursts into wild sobs.					DATA			Counselor, allow me. Please.	Troi drops Sarjenka's hand and steps back, watching	with great interest. Data drops to one knee. The	little girl wraps her arms around his neck, rests her	head on his shoulder, and sobs. Data's eyes are	flicking from side to side, his head is cocking as	waves of confusion break over him. Suddenly his arms	go around her, and he hugs her close. With one hand	he strokes her long hair.          STAR TREK: "Pen Pals" -- REV. 2/21/89 - ACT FIVE          47.34   CONTINUED: (3)					DATA				(continuing)			Hush, it is all right now.

This does			directly concern her.	Data and Sarjenka move down to Ops. She is still	holding his hand. She settles between the two	stations.
