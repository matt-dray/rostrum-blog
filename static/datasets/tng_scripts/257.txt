Baran turns his attention to	Riker, who seems lost in thought near one of the	consoles. Picard is standing nearby.					BARAN				(to Riker)			I suppose I should thank you.			None of us would be alive if it			weren't for you.	But Riker doesn't seem to appreciate Baran's thanks.	His tone is bitter and downcast.					RIKER				(bitter)			You're welcome.	Picard moves smoothly in and begins to mercilessly	torment Riker. In the b.g. Tallera watches their	interchange with a thoughtful expression.					PICARD			What's wrong, Commander?

The doors OPEN and Tallera ENTERS.	Picard doesn't look up.					PICARD				(irritated)			Tell Baran I'm working as fast as			I can.	Tallera just studies him without responding... she's	getting suspicious.

BARAN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS	In contrast to the other quarters on the mercenary	ship, Baran's quarters border on the luxurious...	overstuffed furniture, gaudy sculpture -- very	decadent.

Tallera out.	Baran takes a long, very satisfying drink from his	glass and settles back into his chair.					RIKER			I take it that's good news.					BARAN			Very. It means we've completed			half of what promises to be a very			profitable mission... and even			better than that it means, I'm			almost ready to get rid of your			friend Galen.					RIKER			Really?					BARAN				(nods)			We have only one more artifact to			find... and once Galen confirms			it's genuine, his usefulness on			this ship will come to a very			sudden end.					RIKER			I can't say I'm sorry to hear			that.	Baran studies Riker closely for a moment... he's not	quite sure what to make of him... he might have an ally	here, but Baran is wary and suspicious by his very	nature.					BARAN			I'm sure.				(beat)			Galen may be a loud-mouthed fool,			but sometimes he can be very			perceptive... his observations			about you for instance.					RIKER			Oh?   STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT ONE   12.13   CONTINUED: (2)					BARAN			After what you did at Calder Two,			I doubt you have much of a future			in Starfleet.					RIKER			I've... pretty much come to the			same conclusion.					BARAN			Assuming for the moment that you			were no longer my prisoner... what			would you do now?	Riker thinks about this for a moment... then gives	Baran a very direct look.					RIKER			I guess I'd have to look for a new			career... there must be a place			where someone with fifteen years			of Starfleet technical knowledge			would be useful.				(beat)			Do you know of any place like			that?	Baran takes a drink... he's not going to rush into	anything.					BARAN			Possibly.				(beat)			But if there's one thing I've			learned on this ship, it's to be			cautious... and not to blindly			embrace what seems to be good			fortune. And at the moment, you			seem like a rather large stroke of			luck.					RIKER			I haven't exactly sworn my undying			allegiance to you, Baran. In			fact, I'd like to know a little			bit more about the job.					BARAN			Such as?     STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE     12A.13   CONTINUED: (3)					RIKER			Such as what you meant by a "very			profitable mission."					BARAN				(smiles)			I thought you Starfleet types			weren't interested in things like			profit.					RIKER			I'm not exactly... the "ideal"			Starfleet type.					BARAN			No, I guess you're not.				(beat)			All you need to know for now is			that your share could be more than			enough to insure a very long and			very wealthy life far away from			the Federation.					RIKER			Sounds promising.     STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE     13.13   CONTINUED: (4)					BARAN			It is.

It			wasn't until I saw the image on			the last artifact... that I			realized what the message on the			resonator was.				(beat)			The third image is the Vulcan			symbol for peace... that symbol is			positioned between the symbols for			war and death.					(MORE)       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT FIVE     53A.41   CONTINUED:					PICARD (Cont'd)			It's a warning... that the			resonator's power can be overcome			by peace.					TALLERA			You're about to see how wrong you			are.	The DISSONANT CHORD grows in volume.       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/11/93 - ACT FIVE      54.41   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD				(to officers)			Clear your minds of all aggressive			thoughts...	Tallera concentrates... clearly this is a great effort	for her.42   ON RIKER (OPTICAL)	As the DISTORTION forms in front of him. He steels	himself... tries to ignore it... closes his eyes...	and then the distortion PASSES DIRECTLY THROUGH HIM	without harm.43   TALLERA	Reacts... the effort tired her.					TALLERA				(shocked)			No...					PICARD			Think, Tallera -- two thousand			years ago, your people were being			consumed by war... then they found			the way of peace and logic.			During the same period, the			resonator was dismantled... don't			you see the connection?				(beat)			When peace came to Vulcan, the			resonator became useless. That is			why it was dismantled.	Tallera summons her strength and tries one more time.44   WORF (OPTICAL)	keeps himself calm... as a DISTORTION forms and passes	THROUGH HIM.45   NEW ANGLE	Tallera sags to one knee... sweat pouring down her	forehead... the effort is exhausting her.         STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT FIVE        54A.45   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(quiet)			You were right... the resonator			cannot be stopped with phasers or			shields. But like every other			form of violence... it can be			stopped with peace.	Tallera glares up at him... makes one final effort...	but the DISSONANT CHORD only briefly grows in volume...	then fades away completely. Tallera drops the	resonator to the ground.	Picard quietly moves to the resonator... picks it up...	and carefully removes the pieces. It's finally over.	OFF his expression...                                             CUT TO:       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT FIVE      55.46   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship in orbit around Vulcan.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log: Stardate 47169.2.			Security Minister Satok has taken			Tallera into custody and begun a			search for the rest of the			isolationists.47   INT. CORRIDOR	Picard, Riker and Data are walking through the	Corridor. Picard is still dressed in his Mercenary	outfit. Mid-conversation.					RIKER			Once we realized you weren't on			the mercenary ship, we scanned the			surface for your neural implant...			and tracked the signal to the			cavern.	Picard nods in understanding.					DATA			What will happen to the resonator?					PICARD			Satok assured me that all three			pieces will be destroyed.					DATA			It is unfortunate that it cannot			be studied. The resonator is a			key artifact from a remarkable			period of history.					PICARD			Normally, I would be the first to			agree with you... but perhaps			there are some things best left in			the past.					RIKER			What's going to happen to the			mercenaries?					PICARD			They have been detained by the			Vulcan authorities, for the			moment.					(MORE)       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT FIVE     55A.47   CONTINUED:					PICARD (Cont'd)			But they're also facing charges			from the Klingons, the			Cardassians, the Ferengi, and			about seven other worlds.

You were declared			dead, remember? You can't give			orders around here.	Picard smiles at the joke, but Data misses the humor	and thinks for a moment.					DATA				(to Riker)			If we are to adhere to the exact			letter of Starfleet regulations,			then technically sir, you have			been declared a renegade. In			fact, I believe you are facing			twelve counts of court martial			offenses. You cannot give orders			either.	Picard is quick to jump on this.					PICARD				(to Data)			Quite right. I'm going to get			some sleep. In the meantime I			suggest you escort Commander Riker			to the brig.					DATA			Yes, sir.	Picard EXITS to his quarters and Data takes Riker by	the arm.					DATA			This way, sir...					RIKER			Data, he was just joking... you			know that, right?
