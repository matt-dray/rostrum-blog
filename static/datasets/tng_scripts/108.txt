SPACE - USS ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)	The great ship orbits a blue-green planet softly cloaked	in a swirl of cloud cover.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 41249.3.			We have orbited the two major			planets of the Beta Renner system			taking aboard delegates from			those two worlds. Since achieving			space flight, their major life			forms, the Anticans and the			Selay...2    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM 4 - ANGLE ON PICARD	in full dress uniform, waiting impatiently near the	platform. O.S. TRANSPORTER SOUND IS BUILDING.3    ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER	as FIVE FIGURES begin to form in the sparkling	TRANSPORTER EFFECT. As they solidify, they are revealed	as FIVE ALIENS (Selay). The Chief Delegate is SSESTAR.	All Selay are tall and two axhandles across the	shoulders. Their reptilian heads are sinister -- sleek	scaled skin, lipless mouths, and beady eyes. The	markings on their heads are cobra-like, and folds of	skin at the neck imply a cobra hood.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			... have become deadly enemies.			But both have also applied for			admission into our Federation.			We are to deliver these			delegates to this sector's neutral			Conference Planet called			"Parliament" in the hope their			dispute can be resolved.       STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER       2.3    CONTINUED	Picard gestures the Selay off the platform with a	somewhat strained smile.					PICARD			I am Captain Picard. We hope			to make this journey pleasant			and comfortable. Arranging			that will be my first officer,			Commander Riker.4    REVERSE ANGLE - ON RIKER AND TASHA	also in dress uniform, waiting near the Transporter	control console. TASHA concentrates on the Selay	delegates as RIKER steps forward formally.					RIKER			Welcome aboard. If you'll follow			me...				(starts MOVING OFF)			... I'll show you the			accommodations we've...5    WIDER ANGLE	The Selay leader, Ssestar, interrupts:					SSESTAR			We can already smell the Anticans.			They were taken aboard first?					PICARD			Only because their world was the			first on our heading to			Parliament.					SSESTAR			Will our quarters be near the			Anticans?					PICARD			About one hundred meters apart.			Is that all right?					SSESTAR			No. Unsatisfactory.	Picard starts to frown, but Riker nods to the captain	-- he'll handle it.       STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER       3.5    CONTINUED					RIKER			I believe we can accommodate their			wishes, Captain.				(to Ssestar)			We'll rearrange suite assignments.			If you'll follow me?	Ssestar hesitates, then grunts an assent and motions	his people to follow as he moves toward the door.					SSESTAR			And we must be upwind from the			Anticans.					RIKER			Of course, sir...	The delegation EXITS with Riker. As they leave and the	DOORS CLOSE:					TASHA			Neither seem very promising			Federation candidates.	Picard nods, begins EXITING with Tasha.					PICARD			Even Parliament's peacemakers may			find this case difficult.6    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship moves majestically out of orbit, goes into the	WARP SPEED EFFECT.7    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE	All the regular crew at their stations, except for	Geordi and Worf, who are absent. A replacement CONN	OFFICER is at that panel, next to DATA at Ops.					PICARD				(to Riker)			Do you understand the basis of			all that nonsense between them?					RIKER			No sir. I didn't understand that			kind of hostility even when I			studied Earth history.       STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER       4.7    CONTINUED					PICARD			Oh? Well, yes, but these life			forms feel such passionate hatred			over differences in customs, God			concepts, and even strangely enough,			economic systems...8    ANOTHER ANGLE	Data has frowned at something on his panel, looks around	at Picard.					DATA			Sir, my sensors are picking up			an unusual energy object ahead.					PICARD			On screen.	Data punches up the command.9    ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	A strange ENERGY PATTERN moving at warp speed.					TASHA			Confirmed, sir. My sensors read			nothing solid but considerable			energy in...				(puzzles over reading)			... in changing patterns.					DATA			Traveling at warp speed, too.			Intriguing.				(tabs panel, looks up)			I can find no match with anything			in our records, sir.					PICARD				(eyes viewer; then)			Change course for a close sensor			pass... we'll then increase warp			speed to reach Parliament on			schedule.					DATA			Aye, sir.       STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER       5.10   INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON GEORDI AND WORF	The room is small, busy with equipment, including one	key console. GEORDI is leaning over the complicated	console and talking to WORF as he runs a pattern on the	panel.					GEORDI			Why the interest in this, Worf?			It is just routine maintenance			on the sensor assemblies.					WORF			Simple, Geordi. Our captain			wants his junior officers to			learn, learn, learn...					GEORDI				(grins)			Not just the junior ones.				(indicates)			Okay, hold this relay off-line			while...	Worf moves in and takes over as indicated, while:					TASHA'S COM VOICE			Security to Sensor Maintenance.					GEORDI			La Forge here.11   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE					TASHA			We're making a close sensor pass			on an unusual object, Geordi.			Any problems?					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			None, Lieutenant. All equipment			on line and functioning.					TASHA				(turns to Captain)			Sensors ready, sir.					PICARD				(to Data)			Life form reading?					DATA			No life form reading, sir.					PICARD			Begin the pass.       STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER       6.12   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND ENERGY "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)	as the Enterprise changes course slightly to intercept	the "cloud."13   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	as they close rapidly with the object.					DATA			Sir, it is changing shape... !14   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)	The "cloud" bulging out slightly, putting the bulge in	the Enterprise's path.15   ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA					PICARD			Any readings indicating matter			there?					DATA			Negative, Captain. Energy only.16   EXT. SPACE - CLOSE ON ENTERPRISE AND "CLOUD" (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise begins passing just through the wispy	edge of it.17   INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON WORF AND GEORDI	(OPTICAL)	Worf is where he moved in at the console relay. Geordi	is standing to one side. Suddenly there is a BRIEF GLOW	(OPTICAL) from the key console to Worf. The big Klingon	jerks as though something has struck him, and he	convulses spasmodically and collapses. Geordi tabs his	communicator instantly.					GEORDI			La Forge to Sickbay. Medical			emergency in Sensor Maintenance			Room!       STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - TEASER       7.17   CONTINUED	MOVE IN CLOSE ON GEORDI as he bends over the crumpled	Klingon.					GEORDI				(continuing)			Repeat -- medical emergency!									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE      8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:18   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	plunging through space at warp speed, leaving the	"cloud" behind.19   INT. SENSOR MAINTENANCE ROOM - ON WORF AND GEORDI	Worf still lies in a heap on the floor, Geordi leaning	over him and checking for life signs. Worf begins to	stir, slowly at first, as the doors SLIDE OPEN and	Beverly and ASSISTANT ENTER at a dead run, medical	devices in hand. They quickly kneel at Worf, begin	checking him.					BEVERLY			What happened?					GEORDI			Don't know. It seemed like he			was hit by...				(shakes head)			... some sensor feedback, maybe.	Worf suddenly starts to powerfully flail his arms and	legs around, struggling against something we can't see.	The assistant tries to hang on, but Worf's Klingon	strength sends him across the room. Then, as Worf	flails at furniture in his way, easily splitting it,	Beverly has opened the medical kit with quick	efficiency, pulls out a hypospray, and administers it.20   CLOSER - EMPHASIZING WORF	He stops struggling, looks around with eyes that seem	to be seeing for the first time. An expression of	wonder and amazement crosses his face. Beverly and	Geordi exchange a glance, both clearly concerned.					BEVERLY			Lieutenant Worf?				(no response)			Lieutenant, can you hear what I'm			saying?	Worf manages a sort of grunt, holds up a hand and	stares at it. Then he moves his body, trying to get	his feet under him. He is at first unable to get the	right coordination down, as though this simple act is	as foreign to him as it is to a newborn.      STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE      9.20   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY				(continuing)			Let's get him up.	They rise. Worf watches and sees how they do it. As	they both reach down to boost him by the arms, he	manages to get to his knees and start to push to his	feet. Beverly is studying him closely. He does not	seem violent now; he stares around more like a young and	bewildered child. Beverly nods to Geordi, picks up her	medical kit, and they start to lead Worf OUT. He moves	with them, slowly and carefully putting one foot ahead	of the other.21   INT. READY ROOM - ANGLE ON GEORDI AND PICARD	Picard is at his desk, Geordi standing before it.	Picard looks up at him, frowning as:					GEORDI			He was just monitoring the sensor			console when he jerked as though			something hit him. What my			sensors showed...				(frowns)			... It was kind of a... glow... just			for a second. I can't explain it.					PICARD			Could your VISOR device have			malfunctioned?					GEORDI			Doubt it, sir. It seemed what			I was seeing was something real.22   INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY, TROI, WORF	Worf lies on an examination table, Beverly and assistant	working over him with her medical scanners. Troi looks	up at the o.s. medical viewscreen, then back at Worf.	The Klingon is quiet now, his eyes moving around the	room and to the women. His attitude is one of quiet and	deep curiosity. Beverly finishes, smiles down at Worf.					BEVERLY			I'm going to give you something			to help you rest. Just relax.      STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE      10.22   CONTINUED:	Worf's expression remains unchanged. Beverly brings out	a hypospray and activates it on his arm. His eyelids	begin to sag closed almost immediately. Beverly puts	away the hypospray, motions Troi into her office.23   INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - BEVERLY AND TROI	on their ENTRY:					BEVERLY			Fortunately, he's stronger than			an orbital tug. There's nothing			physically wrong with him. What			have you sensed?					TROI			Nothing... which bothers me. He			has never shielded his feelings			from me. I can't understand why			he is suddenly doing it now.					BEVERLY			Are you able to perceive anything			at all, Counselor? It may be			important.					TROI				(beat; concentrating)			Perhaps... very faintly.			Almost... like a frightened			child.					BEVERLY			Worf "frightened?"					TROI			It doesn't make much sense but...				(beat; concentrating)			Yes, it's fear. Definitely there.	They exchange puzzled looks.24   OMITTED      STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE      11.25   INT. BADAR N'D'D'S QUARTERS - ON TASHA ANDBADAR N'D'D	BADAR N'D'D is wraith-thin, pale, with glittering	lupine eyes; and when he curls his mouth in what looks	like a smile, some extremely long, sharp canines are	revealed. His clothing can only be described as	disreputable -- dark and loose, somehow lumpy (as though	it hides body parts we don't want to know about).	Tasha's tremulous smile is offset by a twitch of her	nose that indicates Anticans don't smell too nice.	Riker ENTERS.					TASHA			Sorry to call you, sir, not			strictly security, it's about			the dietary requirements of the			Antican delegates.26   INTERCUT RIKER AND TASHA					RIKER			I thought that had been taken care			of in advance, Tasha.					TASHA			So did we, sir. Their live			animals were beamed aboard -- We			were going to preserve the meat			for them, but ....				(squeamishly)			... they say we must bring it to			them alive.					RIKER				(beat)			Then do so!				(to the Antican)			Lieutenant Yar was... confused.			We no longer enslave animals			for food purposes.					BADAR N'D'D			But we have seen humans eat meat!	The Antican grins -- a terrifying display of long,	sharp fangs.					RIKER			You've seen something as fresh			and tasty as living meat, but			inorganically materialized out			of patterns used by our			transporters.					BADAR N'D'D				(in revulsion)			How sickening! How barbaric!      STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE      12.27   INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON BEVERLY AND WORF (OPTICAL)	Worf lies sedated on one of the beds, being	automatically monitored by the medical computers.	Beverly approaches with a medical instrument in hand	to take some samples. She leans over the bed, using	the instrument on his arm. As she does, there is a	SUDDEN SPLIT-SECOND BURST OF ELECTRIC-LIKE ENERGY	BETWEEN THEM. Beverly is highlighted briefly by a BLUE	GLOW (OPTICAL). She steps back away from the bed,	blinking as if trying to assimilate some new	information.28   ANOTHER ANGLE	Troi ENTERS from the Corridor. Beverly looks around	at her, puzzled, as Troi moves closer, looking up at	the medical viewscreen.					TROI			He's reading normal? How did you			manage that?					BEVERLY				(dazed)			Yes... normal, now.					TROI				(looks up quickly)			Are you all right?					BEVERLY			Yes... perfectly.	Beverly looks at the medical instrument in her hand,	seems to remember.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			Yes... both of us quite normal.	Beverly ministers to Worf. Worf starts to stir,	shaking his head and blinking as if clearing his head of	something.					WORF			Where... where am I?					TROI			Don't you remember? You were in			the Sensor Maintenance Room ---					WORF			I remember monitoring the sensor			console -- and that's all. What			am I doing here?      STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE      13.28   CONTINUED:					TROI			That's a story the doctor will			tell you.	She starts to smile over at Beverly, and the smile slips	a little. Beverly is staring at the medical viewer	again, deep in thought, paying no attention to Troi and	Worf.29   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON DATA AND PICARD (OPTICAL)	at Science Station 1. Data is replaying visual of	"cloud" on the screen for Picard's observation.					DATA			I called it a "cloud" for lack			of a better term at the time.			But the sensor pass shows it as			much more. Combinations very			complex, precise energy			patterns...					PICARD			Constantly interacting on each			other?					DATA			Yes, sir... But whether			individually or as a whole, it			is difficult to say.					PICARD			Obviously, you seem to feel it			should be inspected more closely.					DATA			A mystery is only a mystery as			long as it remains uninvestigated,			sir.					PICARD			Ah. I love a mystery, Mister			Data, but this one has to wait			until we deliver the delegates			to their peace conference on			Parliament.	He walks down the ramp toward his command chair.      STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE      14.30   INT. CRUSHERS' QUARTERS - ON WESLEY	Wesley is in the living area, working with a P.A.D.D.	and a Viewscreen, quickly tapping commands into the	P.A.D.D. and watching figures or diagrams change on the	o.s. viewer. The quarters doors are HEARD to SLIDE	OPEN, and Wesley looks around.31   WESLEY'S P.O.V. - BEVERLY	Beverly comes in, looks around apparently startled as	Wesley speaks, but she seems to recover composure	quickly. (NOTE: Throughout, Beverly appears remote,	not displaying her normal warmth toward her son, views	him almost as though he is an interesting stranger.)					WESLEY			Hi Mom. You're back early.					BEVERLY			Yes.	She moves closer to him and looks at the viewer as he	indicates it and the P.A.D.D.					WESLEY			Physical sciences class. We're			studying Doctor Channing's theory			on dilithium crystals.					BEVERLY			Tell me about it.	Wesley looks up at her, slightly puzzled. She never	was interested before -- now her eyes glitter with an	unaccustomed curiosity.					WESLEY			Really? You never seemed that			interested in warp theory before.				(indicates)			Doctor Channing thinks it's			possible to force dilithium into			even more useful crystals. If			as shown here, matter and			antimatter could be aligned even			more efficiently...					BEVERLY				(interrupting)			Would that affect navigation?					WESLEY			This is engineering, not helm			control.      STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE      15.31   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Oh yes, the helm's located on the			bridge.					WESLEY				(stares, concerned)			Mom, is something wrong?	Without answering, turns and heads for the door. Wesley	stares after her, frowning, as she EXITS.32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING PICARD	He glances around as the turbolift doors OPEN, and	Beverly ENTERS and advances down the ramp toward Geordi,	back at his helm position. (NOTE: She is still not	acting in her usual manner. Everything about the bridge	seems to be of interest to her, as though she's never	seen it before. She responds with darting, curious	little looks when spoken to, not quite able to focus	long on the person whom she addresses. Her speech	patterns have become very formal, also not like her.	Also notice she does not call the captain by his rank or	address him as "sir.")					BEVERLY				(to herself)			This... is the helm.	Geordi looks up surprised, then grins, nods.					GEORDI			Unless there have been some			changes I don't know about.					PICARD			Doctor Crusher?					BEVERLY			You will wish to know Lieutenant			Worf is much improved. Ready to			report back on duty.					PICARD			What was the diagnosis?	Beverly heads for the upper bridge.					BEVERLY			A temporary mental abberation.					PICARD			When it concerns a bridge officer,			I expect a better explanation,			Doctor.      STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE      16.32   CONTINUED:	Beverly nods, moves toward the Science Stations.					BEVERLY			Then I must first run some			crosschecks in the			library-computer. Klingons are			so unusual in their reactions,			aren't they?					PICARD				(still puzzled, but:)			Take Science Station Two, Doctor.33   ANGLE ON BEVERLY (OPTICAL)	moving to where Data is in view too. She begins calling	up information. Innocently, Data glances to her	Viewscreen. What he sees there puzzles but does not	alarm him.					DATA			Intriguing, Doctor. What does			helm control have to do with			medical crosschecks?	She ignores him, then seems satisfied over what she	views. Data has turned back to his own panel -- Beverly	appears to carefully pick out a place in which to touch	her panel again... and as she does so, a blue electronic	EFFECT APPEARS BRIEFLY ON THE PANEL, then quickly	DISAPPEARS. Beverly blinks, then looks around as if	awaking from a dream.					BEVERLY			I... I don't know why I'm...					DATA				(looks up)			Is something wrong, Doctor?34   ANGLING ON PICARD AND UPPER BRIDGE	Picard looks around, concerned over Beverly seeming to	be disoriented.					PICARD			Doctor, are you all right?      STAR TREK: "Lonely Among Us" - 8/21/87 - ACT ONE      17.34   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Yes... yes. I -- I'll do my work			from my office. That's where I			should be...	She MOVES OFF quickly toward the turbolift. Picard	watches her, still concerned.					PICARD			Do you want someone to accompany			you?	She EXITS into the turbolift.

CORRIDOR NEAR ENGINEERING - ANGLE ON TURBOLIFT	The corridor is oddly low lit. As the turbolift DOORS	OPEN and Riker STEPS OUT, he glances around, frowning	at the lack of light. He starts toward Engineering,	and a SPARKLING LOOP suddenly whips over his head and	around his neck. He lurches back, yanked by the	garrote; then it is abruptly loosened. Riker regains	his balance as the garrote is whipped away from his	neck, and he turns to see:86   ANOTHER ANGLE - SSESTAR AND RIKER					RIKER			What in hell... ?	The large Reptilian manages what appears to be an	apologetic smile.					SSESTAR			Sorry.
