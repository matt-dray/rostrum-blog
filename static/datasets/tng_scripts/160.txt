A modern community.	Beverly, Data and Worf are walking through the plaza.					PICARD (V.O.)			Although non-aligned, the planet			has enjoyed a long trading			relationship with the Federation.	Beverly spots the cafe, and stops.					BEVERLY			We've still got a few minutes			before our next meeting...	Worf scans the plaza. Everything seem calm. They	ENTER, and seat themselves at a table.	A WAITER stands by the door staring intently into the	plaza. He does not acknowledge the presence of the	Starfleet officers.

Worf and Data are moving after her... behind	them, at the door, the waiter watches with interest,	also moves outside...4    EXT. PLAZA	A scene of chaos. Shattered glass lies glittering on	the pavement. Dust and debris from the explosion is	settling. A jet of some escaping gas pours from a	broken pipe. Three people are down, all of them	showing blood.5    ANGLE - TWO POLICEMEN	ENTER. Beverly starts to move to the first victim, but	an officer draws a phaser, and blocks her way.					BEVERLY			Put that thing away. I'm a			doctor.	Beverly isn't waiting for permission.

I am.	Worf comes back out of the restaurant with some	ripped-up tablecloths, some liquor bottles... he's	helped by the waiter who crosses to Beverly... as she	takes the materials, immediately begins to utilize them	in emergency care... she barely glances up at the	waiter who is interested in what she's doing... a	throwaway line --    STAR TREK: "The High Ground" - REV. 11/8/89 - TEASER    3A.5    CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY			Thank you.					WAITER			Not at all, Doctor.       STAR TREK: "The High Ground" - 11/3/89 - TEASER       4.5    CONTINUED: (2)	He moves away... takes a beat at the entrance to the	cafe to look back again, thoughtfully, then enters...6    ANOTHER ANGLE - DATA					DATA			Captain, there has been an			incident.									INTERCUT TO:7    INT.

CAVERN	A perimeter of light holds the stygian darkness at	bay. In some places movable screens augment the	natural stone wall which have formed to create a	sense of privacy.	Beverly is in a secluded area with rock walls on three	sides. The alcove is furnished simply -- a cot, a	small table, and a folding chair. Beverly is seated	on the camp bed. Her hands and ankles have been bound,	and she shifts uncomfortably. She is angry and afraid,	and trying to hide it.	A MAN, KYRIL FINN enters. Beverly swallows hard, lifts	her chin, and tries to stare him down, but she ends up	looking only anxious.	Finn is an attractive man in his early thirties, but	he has an air of shyness and awkwardness which seems	out of place with his combat style clothing, and the	phaser he wears. His hair's a little too long and wavy	for serious bad-ass. In fact, with his hunch	shouldered stance and one hand dug deep into his pocket	he looks like a man trying to be overlooked. In his	other hand, he has a plate of food.					FINN			Are you hungry? Do you want			something to eat?	She just stares at him. Scared, doing bravado.					FINN			I doesn't matter to me. You			want to be hungry? Be hungry.	He sits in front of her... picks at the food, eating	with his hands...					FINN			What's your name?	No response.					FINN			You're a doctor on a Federation			starship?				(beat)			I always wondered what it would			be like to travel across the			galaxy.					(MORE)   STAR TREK: "The High Ground" - REV. 11/6/89 - ACT ONE   10.21   CONTINUED:					FINN (Cont'd)				(rueful, self-deprecating)			It's not something I've exactly			had time for.	Stonewalling him. He shrugs.					FINN			This isn't the best way to meet			new people, is it?	He stands.					FINN			If you want something, just ask			for me -- Kyril Finn.				(a beat)			They know me.	He EXITS and takes the plate of food with him. As	he exits, she looks down, angry, helpless...22   INT. CAPT. READY ROOM - CLOSE ON WESLEY	who has just heard the news. Pulling back to reveal...					TROI			We have no reason to believe she's			been hurt in any way...					PICARD			In fact, it's more likely that			they will take good care of her...			if they want to use her as a			bargaining chip.					WESLEY				(beat)			A bargaining chip?					TROI			The innocent become the pawns in			a conflict like this, Wesley.	Picard thinks a beat, stands... begins to move around	the desk toward Wes.      STAR TREK: "The High Ground" - 11/3/89 - ACT ONE      11.22   CONTINUED:					PICARD			The Ansata separatists have been			trying for generations to be freed			from the rule of the Eastern			Continent. If they can get the			government to even acknowledge			their demands, then kidnapping			your mother will have served a			purpose.	He leans on his desk.					PICARD				(continuing)			That may be what they are after.			It may not. Frankly, I don't			care. All I care about is getting			her back, Wesley... In a few			minutes, we're leaving to meet			with the authorities...					WESLEY				(interrupting)			Request permission to be on the			away team, sir.					PICARD			No. You have an important job			to do here. If we are to find			your mother, we must have a way			to trace the movements of these			terrorists. I want you on the			team that will investigate this			new technology of theirs.					WESLEY			I understand.					PICARD			Report to Mister Data. Dismissed.	He exits. Picard glances at Troi. They share a	moment. She acknowledges his efforts.					TROI			He needs your strength right now.					PICARD				(beat)			History has shown us that strength			may be useless in the face of			terrorism, Counselor.	Off Troi's reaction...   STAR TREK: "The High Ground" - REV. 11/7/89 - ACT ONE   12.23   INT. ALEXANA'S OFFICE - DAY	Alexana Devos, a striking woman in her late thirties,	meets with Picard and Riker. (This is the same woman	we saw in the teaser.) Tall and athletic, she is a	natural born leader. But she is also a woman under	great pressure, caught up in a struggle that she's no	longer sure she can win. Trying to deal with a hundred	problems at once has left her preoccupied and driven	and almost burned out. She is sitting down at a desk	littered with isolinear reader chips. On one wall are	monitors that provide a running text of current police	activity. She studies them intently.					PICARD			What exactly is Ansata policy in			regard to hostages?					ALEXANA			I doubt they have one. They don't			usually take hostages.	The implications of such a strategy is not lost on	Picard or Riker. She turns to face them...   STAR TREK: "The High Ground" - REV. 11/6/89 - ACT ONE   13.23   CONTINUED:					ALEXANA			These aren't people we're dealing			with here. They're animals...				(her anger rising)			Fanatics, who kill without remorse			or conscience... who think nothing			of murdering innocent people.					PICARD			They could just as easily have			shot her where she stood...					ALEXANA				(acknowledges)			Don't ask me to explain them.			I can't. The atrocities I've			seen...	A beat as Alexana forces herself to gain her composure.					ALEXANA			And now they have this new device			that makes them even more deadly.			How do I combat an enemy who fails			to register on any scanner until			they're literally standing in			front of you with a phaser pointed			at your head?					RIKER			What can you tell us about this			device?	Alexana removes an armband from a drawer, and tosses	it onto the desk.					ALEXANA			Not much, really.	Picard picks up the device, and inspects it, hands	it to Riker. Over this Alexana continues.   STAR TREK: "The High Ground" - REV. 11/5/89 - ACT ONE   14.23   CONTINUED: (2)					ALEXANA (cont'd)			They first started using it two			months ago. We've taken several			of these off dead terrorists.			Our people have looked at them...			Nothing they can explain...					RIKER			You mind if we take this with			us... give our people a chance			to study it?					ALEXANA			Not at all. And I'll put you in			touch with our research people, if			you wish.					PICARD			I appreciate your help.					ALEXANA				(a wry smile)			Perhaps if we found ourselves in			possession of some of that			advanced Federation weaponry of			yours it would shift the balance			of power back to our favor.					PICARD			That we cannot do for you.					ALEXANA				(as she expected)			No, of course not.	Picard rises. The others follow suit.					PICARD			I would like to leave Commander			Riker to assist in your search			for Doctor Crusher.	As she walks them to the door:					ALEXANA				(it won't help)			If you like...					RIKER			You don't sound very optimistic.   STAR TREK: "The High Ground" - REV. 11/7/89 - ACT ONE   15.23   CONTINUED: (3)					ALEXANA			I know my enemy, Commander...			They don't leave much room for			optimism.	Off Picard and Riker's worried expressions.24   INT. CAVERN	As before, Finn enters with a plate of food. Same line	--					FINN			Are you hungry? Do you want			something to eat?	She's looking quite a bit more tired than before. But	she's still not willing to respond... at least not on	the first volley.	He studies her... puts down the plate, moves to her...	Beverly can't control the impulse. She shrinks back in	fear.					FINN			Relax, I'm just going to...	He indicates her bonds. He drops to one knee, and	releases her ankles. (And note: that despite his	rumpled, good guy attitude there is a side of this that	could be considered torture, manipulation, setting up	dependency.)					FINN			Come on. Eat something. What's			the point of not eating? You're			the only one who suffers. Do I			look like it's bothering me?			Okay, it's bothering me.	He picks up the plate and holds it out in front of her.	She finally takes it... begins to pick up the meat with	her fingers, eats...					FINN			No forks.

I hurt them.	He grabs the food dish out of her hands. Stands.					FINN			You're finished eating. Get up.	When she looks up at him, hesitating with fear... he	reaches down and pulls her up roughly...					FINN			Get up.	He indicates for her to precede him out of the alcove,	and she begins to obey. They start out into the cave	proper. Beverly suddenly pauses, and looks up at him.	She is embarrassed by the non-sequitur, but can't	control herself.					BEVERLY			I have... a son.					FINN			You'll be with him again, Doctor.			I see no reason to kill you.	The inference being if he did see a reason later, he	might.

CAVERN	For the first time, we see full breadth of the rebel	camp... as Finn and Beverly move by, a pair of	children, one watches while the other cleans a	weapon... people look over at Beverly, exchange looks	with Finn who nods confidently -- he's got this under	control.	He leads her to a section of the cave that has been	set aside as an infirmary. A section of the cave has	been set aside as an infirmary. Five patients rest	on cots. A couple are bandaged, but don't seem to be	in much distress.
