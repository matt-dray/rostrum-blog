MAIN BRIDGE - (OPTICAL)	PICARD, WORF, DATA, RIKER, TROI, SUPERNUMERARIES as	needed.					DATA			Captain, sensors have located the			transport ship.

Can we			assist you in any way?					TALMADGE'S COM VOICE			No injuries... but I'd like			permission to transport a couple			of guests to your ship.   STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/27/92 - TEASER   3.2A   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Of course...					TALMADGE'S COM VOICE			We're conveying a mediator to			Seronia.

TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Troi ENTERS the Transporter Room. The Transporter	TECHNICIAN works the console and AMBASSADOR ALKAR and	his mother MAYLOR MATERIALIZE.	Alkar is in his 30's, very attractive. His serenity	is contrasted by a deep sense of purpose.	Maylor is an ancient woman, with white hair, craggy	face, and stooped back. But there is a deeper power	that emanates from her that is intense -- and	disquieting. She simmers with rage, and while she is	not loud or grating, there is a malignancy which	permeates every word she speaks. She looks right at	Troi.					TROI			I'm Counselor Deanna Troi.   STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/28/92 - TEASER   4.2B   CONTINUED:	Alkar steps down, hand extended.					ALKAR			Ambassador Ves Alkar...				(gestures)			... and my mother, Sev Maylor.			Counselor, it's imperative that			I speak with your Captain...	Before Troi can answer, Maylor comes off the stage,	moves right toward her, locks on and drills into her.					MAYLOR			You think he's attracted to you...			but he isn't. You offer him			nothing...	There is a brief, stunned silence. Alkar moves	smoothly in, takes Maylor's arm.					ALKAR			She hasn't been well. Could she			be taken to quarters?					TROI			Of course.				(to Transporter Chief)			Chief...				(to Alkar)			I'll take you to meet Captain			Picard...	The Transporter Chief moves toward Maylor. Alkar	addresses Maylor, nodding toward the Chief.					ALKAR			Go with him...	Maylor accedes, walks toward the door... but stops and	looks back at Troi.					MAYLOR			Don't pursue him. I won't have			it... I'll stop you...	The Transporter Chief eases her out the door. Alkar	looks apologetically at Troi.     STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - 7/24/92 - TEASER     5-6.3    CLOSE ON TROI	hand at her throat, looking not just uncomfortable,	but deeply upset by this strange and unexpected	incident.                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                             STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT ONE   7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            A3	OMITTEDA4	INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)	Picard and Alkar are talking with Starfleet ADMIRAL	SIMONS who is on the viewscreen.					ALKAR				(with some urgency)			I am grateful for the			Federation's offer to escort me,			but if I arrive at Rekag-Seronia			on the Enterprise, the armed			Flagship of Starfleet, my mission			as a Peace negotiator will be			compromised. There must be a			Federation transport ship in the			area that could take me there.					PICARD			With all due respect, Admiral			-- to put the Ambassador on			another unarmed transport will			only invite a second assault.					ALKAR			I believe the attack on us was			an isolated incident, nothing			more...	The Admiral pauses, taking in both sides, then --  STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT ONE  7A.A4	CONTINUED:					ADMIRAL			Ambassador Alkar... the			Rekag-Seronia dispute has			threatened Federation ships for			many months. We are grateful that			you are willing to undertake this			mission... and you have our full			support.					ALKAR			Thank you, sir.					ADMIRAL			However, we also recognize that			safety is an issue -- not just			yours, but the crew that escorts			you. To send you on an unarmed			transport puts everyone at risk.			I think it's best if you proceed to			Rekag-Seronia aboard the			Enterprise.   STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT ONE   8.A4	CONTINUED: (2)	There is a hesitation... Alkar doesn't agree, but	acquiesces.					ALKAR			Then I have no choice.					ADMIRAL			Once you get to Rekag-Seronia,			you may conduct your negotiations			as you see fit. Until then --			you'll be in good hands with			Captain Picard.	The message of the speech is not lost on Alkar, who	smiles. Even when he's in disagreement, nothing seems	to ruffle him.					ALKAR			... I understand.					ADMIRAL SIMONS			Good luck, and a successful			journey.	The Admiral disappears from the Viewscreen. Picard	looks at Alkar, then--					PICARD			Picard to Riker.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Yes, sir?					PICARD			Set a course for Seronia.4    INT. GYM	A soft-form martial arts class is in progress (like	the one in "Clues"); the group wears a form of gi.  STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/27/92 - ACT ONE  8A.4    CONTINUED:	Worf leads it; Troi is participating -- and Alkar.	Alkar's skill is evident in the way he moves.	At one point, Troi looks over and smiles at him.	Worf completes the final move, then --					WORF			That is all for today. There will			be another class tomorrow at			oh-seven-hundred hours.	The group moves off in casual clusters. Troi finds	herself face to face with Alkar.					TROI			The skills are demanding...			You're very disciplined.   STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/27/92 - ACT ONE   9.4    CONTINUED: (2)					ALKAR			I believe in a strong connection			between body and mind.				(beat)			You obviously share that			conviction.	She smiles at him.					TROI			Yes... Only sometimes I have a			problem getting my body to conform			to my mind's wishes...	He laughs and they EXIT frame.4A   INT. CORRIDOR	as they come from the gym.					TROI			I would imagine that your			self-discipline helps you in your			work...	He shrugs and smiles in a self-deprecating way.					ALKAR			I don't know about that... I think			maybe my biggest asset is			patience.	She gives him a questioning look.					ALKAR			I let everybody else talk until			they're exhausted... then when			I start, they're too tired to			argue.	She smiles at that.					TROI			You're going to need all your			patience at Seronia... I can't			imagine how you'll get the two			sides talking to each other...	Again, his modest smile.  STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/27/92 - ACT ONE  10.4A   CONTINUED:					ALKAR			Neither can I. I won't know that			until I get there. I tend to feel			my way through a situation...	They have reached a Turbolift, and ENTER it.4B   INT. TURBOLIFT					ALKAR			Deck nine. If I were empathic,			like you... I'd have a real			advantage.					TROI			I thought Lumerians were			empathic...					ALKAR			Only with each other, not other			species. So... I don't have any			idea what you might be feeling			just now...	She thinks, smiles to herself.					TROI			Curiosity...				(off his look)			What I sense from you is very			unusual. Serenity... calmness...			tranquility... you seem to embody			the very qualities you hope to			draw out in others.	The Turbolift doors open and they EXIT.5    INT. CORRIDOR					ALKAR			Tell me, Counselor... have you			ever been involved in diplomatic			negotiations?					TROI			Several times... with Captain			Picard. There've been instances			when having an empath along has			been helpful.  STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT ONE  10A.5    CONTINUED:					ALKAR			I'm sure.				(beat)			I could use some of that help.			Would you come with me when we			reach Seronia?					TROI			If the Captain authorizes it, of			course I will.	They have reached his quarters.					ALKAR			I hope to see you again.	She smiles in response, and turns to head up the	corridor. But suddenly the door OPENS -- and there	stands Maylor, quietly furious, eyes blazing.					MAYLOR			You're late.					ALKAR			Mother, I told you I would be gone			for over an hour...					MAYLOR			You're late because of her.     STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - 7/24/92 - ACT ONE     11.5    CONTINUED: (2)	She turns to Troi, and once again, her ancient,	glittering eyes bore into Troi like malevolent lasers.					MAYLOR			Have you mated with him yet?					TROI			What --?					MAYLOR			That's what you want, isn't it?					ALKAR			Mother, come in, please --	But Maylor moves toward Troi, who instinctively moves	back.					MAYLOR			I can always tell. The ones with			a certain look in their eye...					TROI			I'd better go...	Alkar takes his mother's arm, restraining her from	moving in to Troi, but the venom of her words is	unstoppable.					MAYLOR			I'll tell you this... if you do,			you will regret it for the rest			of your life...	Troi shrinks back from the woman, obviously sensing	deeply the malevolence that permeates her.					ALKAR			Come on, Mother... you need to			lie down...	He pulls the woman toward the room, her gaze still	locked intently on Troi's. He gives Troi a helpless	glance.					ALKAR			I'll see you later...	Troi nods and the strange duo disappear into the	quarters. Troi takes several deep breaths, trying to	calm herself.  STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT ONE  12.5A   INT. TROI'S OFFICE	The chime SOUNDS.					TROI			Come in.	The door opens and Riker ENTERS, carrying a Padd.					RIKER			Hi. It's that time again...	She looks at him, perplexed. She's still distracted by	the incident with Maylor. Riker lifts the Padd.					RIKER			The dreaded crew evaluation			reports.	Troi makes a slight grimace. Clearly this is no one's	favorite task.					TROI			Does it have to be today?					RIKER			It won't get any easier tomorrow.					TROI			It might...	She takes a breath, obviously troubled.					RIKER				(concerned)			What is it?					TROI			I've just had a very -- disturbing			encounter with Alkar's mother.				(beat, as her feelings				 emerge)			Wil, she frightens me.					(MORE)  STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/28/92 - ACT ONE  13.5A   CONTINUED:					TROI (Cont'd)			The feelings I sense from her			are -- malevolent. They're out of			proportion -- evil.	Riker stares at her, knowing that if Troi senses those	things, they're there. But maybe there's a reason...					RIKER			I understand she's been ill...			and she's very old -- probably			senile.				(a gentle grin)			Listen... we might all end up like			that some day.	She can't help but smile... and, as usual, Riker has	made her feel better.					TROI			You're right. Okay, let's get			through these evaluations. When			they're done I'm going to reward			myself with two pieces of fudge.	He grins and looks back to the Padd.					RIKER			First, molecular biology.			Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis...    STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - 7/24/92 - ACT ONE    13A.5A   CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			She's just a bitter old woman...			don't give her the power to worry			you.	She smiles at him, grateful, as always, for his	friendship.					TROI			You're right.

There's an			emergency.	Riker and Troi exchange a quick glance and then Riker	is out of there, followed by Troi.6    OMITTED7    INT. ALKAR'S QUARTERS - MINUTES LATER	Riker and Troi ENTER. BEVERLY has two Med Techs there;	they are already into life-saving procedures on Maylor,	who lies sprawled on the floor, unconscious. Troi	moves to Alkar, who is pale and drained, staring at the	form on the floor.					BEVERLY				(to med tech)			Forty cc's inoprovaline.	The med tech gives her a hypospray, she administers	it, watches the portable monitor. Nothing. Beverly	scans Maylor's body once more, takes a breath, looks	up at Alkar... shakes her head.   STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/27/92 - ACT ONE 15-16A      7    CONTINUED:					RIKER			I'm sorry, Ambassador.	Alkar's jaw tightens and he sags slightly, as though	his knees feel spongy. When he speaks, his voice is	slightly husky.					ALKAR			She was ill... I should never have			brought her along...	Alkar turns away in despair.					TROI			Alkar...	Troi follows Alker to comfort him. He takes a few	breaths, gains control.					ALKAR			She was ninety-three... she'd			lived a long life... I should be			grateful for that.	He glances at Troi.					ALKAR			Counselor... there's a funeral			meditation... part of our			rituals... as an empath you're			the only person on board who could			perform it with me...					TROI			I'd be glad to help...	Off their looks --8    OMITTED9    INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - A LITTLE LATER (OPTICAL)	Alkar is opening a small, ornate box. He opens the	box and takes out a few oddly shaped chunks of dark	ore, gives one to Troi.     STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - 7/24/92 - ACT ONE     16.8    CONTINUED:					ALKAR			Captain...					PICARD			I wanted to express my			condolences. This must be a			difficult time for you.					ALKAR			My mother and I were very close.			It will be hard to adjust to life			without her.					PICARD			Do you want to consider postponing			your visit to Bironi? I'm sure			everyone would understand...	When Alkar replies, there's an edge to his voice --	the first time we've heard such an overtone.					ALKAR			I'm no less committed to my task			than I was before my mother died,			Captain.					PICARD			I was only thinking of your best			interests...					ALKAR			They will be served if I can bring			the Bironi and the Rekags			together. For a lasting peace.	The two men eye one another. Then --					WORF'S COM VOICE			Worf to Captain Picard.					PICARD			Go ahead, Mister Worf.					WORF'S COM VOICE			Sensors have picked up a Bironi			warship... in a parallel course			just inside sensor range.					PICARD			Yellow alert, Mister Worf.					WORF'S COM VOICE			Aye, sir.    STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - 7/24/92 - ACT ONE    16A.8    CONTINUED: (2)	Alkar shakes his head, and again, there is a hint of	anger in his voice.					ALKAR			You communicate distrust... you			announce your warlike intentions.			It's not the way to enter into			peace negotiations.					PICARD			I must take the necessary			precautions. One ship you were			on has already been attacked.				(beat)			And I think you'd agree that a			dead man cannot be a particularly			effective negotiator.	This gets a rise from Alkar... he stifles the instinct	to step toward Picard... he clenches his fists and	gains control, then EXITS, leaving Picard to stare	after him.9    INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - A LITTLE LATER (OPTICAL)	Troi sits on a couch, curled up and reading. But she	seems unable to concentrate. Her eyes drift away from	the book and she stares into space. Then, the door	CHIMES. She rises and crosses to it, it opens. Alkar	stands there. He carries a small, ornate box.					ALKAR			Hello.					TROI			Alkar... come in.  STAR TREK: "Man Of The People" - REV. 7/27/92 - ACT ONE  17.9    CONTINUED:					ALKAR			The meditation... is one of our			most sacred ceremonies.	He leads her to the couch.
