SPACE - STARBASE AND ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as the Enterprise moves toward Starbase 74.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 41365.9.			The Enterprise has been ordered			to Starbase 74, in orbit around			Tarsas III.2    EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as the Enterprise closes with the huge starbase	entrance port.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			... where a routine maintenance			check of all systems will be made,			and certain upgrades completed,			including the Holodeck, with which			we have had problems. I anticipate			a glowing report. This ship has			performed magnificently -- beyond			anyone's expectations.3    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	The REGULAR CREWMEMBERS are in their accustomed places	as:					GEORDI			Coming into position.					RIKER			Stand by to dock.					DATA			Ready to dock.4    INT. STARBASE (OPTICAL)	as the Enterprise moves into docking position.          STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - TEASER          2.4    CONTINUED:					RIKER (V.O.)			Engage mooring beams and lock			off.					GEORDI (V.O.)			Aye sir.5    INT. STARBASE (OPTICAL)	The two elements COME INTO PLACE.6    INT. MAIN BRIDGE					GEORDI			Docking complete.					PICARD			Thank you, Number One. Well			done, and well done all.7    INT. ENTERPRISE AIR LOCK	A hatch OPENS to the Starbase and allows the easy	passage of people and supplies. There is a RUSH OF	AIR as the hatch opens. Then a group of maintenance	personnel EMERGE from the far end and CROSS to the	Enterprise.8    INT. AIR-LOCK CORRIDOR	Picard and Riker greet the starbase personnel.	Commander ORFIL QUINTEROS, the base commander, steps	forward. TWO other pale, frail people with translucent	skin stand nearby. They are the BYNARS.					QUINTEROS			Commander Quinteros; request			permission to come aboard.					PICARD			Granted -- and welcome.	Quinteros STEPS FORWARD and shakes Picard's hand.					PICARD				(continuing)			This is Commander Riker.          STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - TEASER          3.8    CONTINUED:	As the two shake hands the group moves down the	corridor.					QUINTEROS			You're late. We expected you a			week ago.					RIKER			We were unexpectedly delayed at			Omicron Pascal.					QUINTEROS			Is there anything specific you			wish to report, or that we should			be aware of?					PICARD			No. We are very pleased with the			operation of the Enterprise.					QUINTEROS			I knew you would be - I was in			charge of the team which put her			together.					RIKER			And are these gentlemen the			Bynars?	He indicates the Bynars.8A   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING	as they ENTER.					QUINTEROS			They're not gentlemen or ladies,			Commander.				(off Riker's look)			They are a unified pair. Always			together. This is One Zero.	One Zero bows.					QUINTEROS				(continuing)			And this is Zero One.	Zero One bows. Picard and Riker nod to them.          STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - TEASER          4.8A   CONTINUED:					QUINTEROS				(continuing)			They just finished upgrading the			computers on the Wellington -- did			a great job.					PICARD				(to the Bynars)			Your reputation precedes you.			I am pleased you will be improving			our system.					BYNAR ONE ZERO			It is a great pleasure...					BYNAR ZERO ONE			... to work on such a large mobile			computer.					PICARD			You have forty-eight hours,			because at forty-eight plus six			we have an appointment at Pelleus			Five which we must keep.	The Bynars swap a look with each another.					ZERO ONE			I thought we'd...					ONE ZERO			... have more time.					PICARD			I'm sorry. Our mission can't be			delayed. Can we postpone this			work?					ZERO ONE			Oh, no. This is...					ONE ZERO			... the best time...					ZERO ONE			... to do it.					ONE ZERO			We can complete...					ZERO ONE			... our work within the...          STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - TEASER          5.8A   CONTINUED: (2)					ONE ZERO			... time allotted.					QUINTEROS			They work very quickly, but it'll			be tight.					PICARD			Commander Riker and I will stay			aboard, and be available should			you need us.					QUINTEROS			Thank you, Captain. I don't think			we'll need you until we're ready			for inspection.	Quinteros nods and FOLLOWS the Bynars AWAY, who CHATTER.9    INT. CORRIDOR	Picard and Riker walking along.					RIKER			The Bynars are perfect for this.			This is the first time I've come			in contact with them.					PICARD			As I understand it, over time			they've become so interconnected			with the master computer on their			planet that their language and			thought patterns have become as			near to binary as possible for			organic beings.					RIKER			It will be interesting to see how			they improve a computer as			advanced as ours.					PICARD			Well, I'm going to put my feet			up, turn on my personal relaxation			light and lose myself in the pages			of some old novels.	They STEP INTO the turbolift.          STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - TEASER          6.10   INT. TURBOLIFT	Picard gives their destination.					PICARD			Bridge.				(then:)			And you, Number One? You've			earned a good rest. What are you			going to do with it?	Riker smiles. The turbolift doors OPEN.					RIKER			I've never been good at organizing			my time off, but something will			come up -- it always does.	Picard nods at him, and STEPS OFF.					PICARD			I'll be in my Ready Room.	Riker acknowledges with a nod. Picard heads toward	his Ready Room as Riker STEPS ONTO the bridge.A11	INT. STARBASE (OPTICAL)	ESTABLISH the Enterprise inside the immense interior.11   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	CLOSE-UP on two of the Bynars as they pull open a	panel. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Riker and Wesley watching	them. Other than these four, the bridge is empty.	The Bynars' CONVERSATION IS UNINTELLIGIBLE. It's a	flow of data based information, which SOUNDS LIKE	HIGH-SPEED RADIO MULTIPLEX IN BURSTS. The sound of	it, and the movements of the aliens amuses Riker. TWO	BYNARS ENTER the bridge and COME hurriedly UP. They	are all in a state of agitation. The CONVERSATION goes	on AT VERY HIGH SPEED.					RIKER			I thought there were only going			to be two of you.					ONE ZERO			Because of the limited time			allotted...          STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - TEASER          7.11   CONTINUED:					ZERO ONE			... us, we need others...	The newly-arrived Bynars continue with a HIGH SPEED	STREAM OF AGITATED CONVERSATION.					RIKER				(picking up on their				 agitation)			Is there a problem?	The Bynars closest turn toward Riker.					ZERO ONE			Ah... No...					ONE ZERO			...no. No problem.	The tone - the hesitation. Riker isn't satisfied.					RIKER			Then why are you all so excited?					ZERO ONE			Because we... ah... have to...					ONE ZERO			... the ah, stacking...					ZERO ONE			... to reconfigure the computer...					ONE ZERO			... to communicate with itself...					ZERO ONE			... more efficiently...					ONE ZERO			... and at higher speeds.	Zero One and One Zero MOVE OFF to help their mates.	Riker watches, concerned.					WESLEY			You act like you don't believe			them.					RIKER			I'm not sure. It's probably			nothing.          STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - TEASER          8.11   CONTINUED: (2)					WESLEY			Maybe it's just how a different			species behaves.	Riker nods thoughtfully.					RIKER			Maybe. I'm going to stroll the			ship. You have the bridge. Keep			an eye on them.					WESLEY			Aye sir.	Riker turns and CROSSES to the turbolift, as Wesley	looks over at the Bynars with a new awareness.									FADE OUT:                         END OF TEASER                                   STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE         9.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:12   INT. CORRIDOR	As Riker walks along he sees TASHA, WORF, and some	other members of the Crew, at the far end of the	corridor. They are dressed for athletics. Each	carries a small duffel bag.					TASHA			We've been challenged to a			friendly game of Parrises Squares			by some of the maintenance			personnel -- want to join us on			the starbase?	Riker makes a quick count.					RIKER			You've already got all the players			you need.					TASHA			We can switch off.					RIKER			No... if you do that in Parrises			Squares you lose the rhythm of			the game.					TASHA			I can't talk you into coming with			us?					RIKER			No. But win, all right? The			pride of the Enterprise goes with			you.					WORF			Rest assured, Commander, we will			be victorious, at whatever the			cost.					RIKER				(concerned)			Worf -- it's just a game. You			know, a little friendly			competition -- work up a sweat,			have some laughs, make new			friends.         STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE         10.12   CONTINUED:					WORF				(with a gleam in his				 eye)			If winning is not important...			then, Commander, why keep score?	Riker can only shrug because he has no answer. Worf	nods a good-bye, and HEADS OFF with the others. Tasha	holds back for a beat.					TASHA			I think he's pulling your leg.			Believe it or not, Worf's			developing a sense of humor.					RIKER			Let's hope so for their sake.	Riker smiles and shakes his head. Tasha, returns the	smile, flashes a quick thumbs up... and SPRINTS OFF to	join the others.13   ANGLE ON RIKER	He watches them go for a lonely moment. The area	SUDDENLY DARKENS. Riker steps over to the com panel.	He touches the panel, which LIGHTS UP, ILLUMINATING	HIM.14   RIKER AT COMPANEL	He touches the panel.					RIKER			Computer -- There's a power			reduction in section L-Ninety			Four. Explain.					COMPUTER			Unoccupied sections are being			closed down in order to clear			space in the main computer banks.			It's necessary to facilitate the			system upgrade. Full power can			be restored if needed.	Riker is satisfied. He MOVES OFF.         STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE         11.15   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - CLOSE ON PAINTING	Its design and form is to be determined, the artist is	Lieutenant Commander Data.					GEORDI (O.S.)			What do you think?					RIKER (O.S.)			First tell me what it's supposed			to be, then I'll give you an			opinion.	PULL BACK TO REVEAL Geordi, Data and Riker examining	the "work of art" which is on an easel set up in the	Observation Lounge.					DATA			It is an attempt at pure			creativity.					GEORDI			What we're investigating is, "Can			Data be creative?"					DATA			This is my attempt... with			guidance from Geordi.					GEORDI			I suggested the Zylo eggs.					RIKER			Is that what those are?	Riker heads for the door.					RIKER				(continuing)			Keep notes. This project might			turn out to be of interest to			future scholars.					GEORDI			Really?					RIKER			Think about it. A blind man			teaching an android to paint?			That's got to be worth a couple			of pages in someone's book.	HOLD ON Data and Geordi as Riker waves a cheerful	good-bye and WALKS OFF.         STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE         12.15A  INT. SICKBAY AND CORRIDOR	BEVERLY is picking up notes and notebooks. She's	excited almost to the point of being frazzled. Riker	ENTERS.					RIKER			You look like you're packing up			and leaving forever.					BEVERLY				(surprised)			Oh -- Commander Riker. No -- I'm			just getting my notes together.			It's so exciting. Doctor Terence			Epstein is at this Starbase.					RIKER			Is he someone I should know about?	He FOLLOWS her OUT into the corridor.					BEVERLY			He's the leading mind in			cybernetics. He lectured at			my medical school. Since the			disaster at Micromius I've been			working on a theory combining			cybernetics and regeneration. It			sounds impossible I know -- but I			think I have an approach which			could work. What an opportunity!			To have a chance to discuss this			with Doctor Esptein. Sorry, Will,			I'd like to stay here and chat --			but I have to be going.	And she's INTO a turbolift -- leaving Riker standing	alone.16   OMITTED17   INT.

What should I do?	Riker steps over to the com panel.         STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE         14.17   CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			Computer - I need a place to play			some music - a little atmosphere.					COMPUTER			Specify.					RIKER			Jazz.					COMPUTER			Era?					RIKER				(pauses)			Circa 1958.					COMPUTER			Location.					RIKER			Kansas City. No, wait. New			Orleans. Yeah. New Orleans -- the			Low Note. 'Round midnight.	Pause.					COMPUTER			Program complete. Enter when			ready.18   HOLODECK DOOR	Riker steps to the entrance. The doors OPEN. Before	him is a --19   OMITTED20   HOLODECK (OPTICAL)	-- JAZZ CLUB -- blue light -- dusty -- low ceiling -- small	tables crowded together -- a worn little bandstand lit	by pencil spots. Riker's impressed.					RIKER			Very good.	He turns and nods his appreciation to the Bynars who	are off to one side watching.         STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE         15.20   CONTINUED:					RIKER				(continuing)			Very good indeed.	He STEPS INTO the Holodeck, turns his attention to the	com panel on the arch. The Bynars, who ENTER with him,	are fascinated.					RIKER				(continuing)			Now, computer -- someone to play			with. A combo. Say, drums			upright bass...piano. And a 'bone			for me.	And just like that, the bandstand IS POPULATED with a	jazz combo, including a trombone waiting on the stand.	NONE OF THE IMAGES MOVE, and they won't until Riker	activates them.					RIKER				(continuing)			Now -- an audience...	And the room IS FULL.					RIKER				(continuing)			Whoa... too many. I was thinking			of something a little more			personal...intimate.	And that quick the room IS EMPTY, SAVE FOR ONE very	pretty blonde who is sitting alone at a front table.	Her hand rests lightly on a glass. Her head is turned	as though expecting someone -- a man to join her. Riker	is very impressed -- not only by what the computer has	accomplished, but by the blonde. He turns to the	Bynars --					RIKER				(continuing)			Great job, boys.	The Bynars TALK among themselves in their unique HIGH	SPEED LANGUAGE. Riker turns back to the room.					RIKER				(continuing)			But, computer... blondes and jazz			seldom go together.         STAR TREK: "11001001" - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE         16.20   CONTINUED: (2)	The girl CHANGES to a redhead -- not the same girl with	red hair, but a different girl, with beautiful green	eyes and a low cut shimmering dress. Absolutely	stunning.					RIKER				(continuing; he turns				 to the Bynars.)			Now that is truly exceptional...				(then back to the				 computer)			...but... more sultry.	And again the girl CHANGES -- this time to a BRUNETTE	-- and even more beautiful.21   ANGLE ON RIKER	This three-dimensional, computer-generated image is so	beautiful it takes his breath.					RIKER				(to the Bynars)			Gentlemen, if this is what you			call "enhancement" you have a gift			for understatement.	He CROSSES to the beautiful WOMAN.22   THE BYNARS	They CONSPIRE EXCITEDLY among themselves.
