BRIDGE	PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, and GEORDI at their	positions; N.D.'s as necessary. There is a	light-hearted mood on the bridge.					PICARD			The last time I encountered			Admiral Gustafson... I ended up			spending nine straight hours at			the opera.					GEORDI			Nine hours... ?					PICARD			The entire "Ring" cycle at one			sitting...					RIKER			That's a little too much Wagner			for me.					PICARD			And for me... but not, apparently,			for Admiral Gustafson.

I warned her that			this time --       STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - 3/24/92 - TEASER       2.4    CONTINUED:					WORF			Sir, sensors detect an			unidentified object... twenty-two			thousand kilometers off the port			quarter.					PICARD			On screen.5    ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	An alien object of unusual shape can be seen, though	still at quite a distance. Picard moves toward the	screen, between t conn and ops.					PICARD			Magnify.	The object springs into greater relief. It is strange,	and somehow foreboding.					PICARD			Mister Data?					DATA			It appears to be a probe of some			kind... but there is no Starfleet			record of this shape or design.					RIKER			Is it scanning us?					WORF			No sir... but it has assumed a			relative position and is holding			course with us.					DATA			The probe is composed of...			paricium and talgonite... a			ceramic alloy.					GEORDI			Not a very sophisticated			technology...					WORF			Sir, I'm detecting a low-level			nucleonic beam coming from the			probe.    STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - REV. 3/26/92 - TEASER    3.5    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Shields up; stand by phasers.					DATA			The beam is scanning the shield's			perimeter.				(frowns)			The probe is emitting an unusual			particle stream --					WORF			Captain, the beam is penetrating			our shields --	A point at the top of the probe seems to FLARE briefly,	as...					PICARD			Increase power to --	Suddenly Picard staggers backward, as though struck.	He sags, losing consciousness. Riker is already	rushing to him as he begins falling.					RIKER			Captain?...6    CLOSER - PICARD	As he falls, losing consciousness, Riker's hand ENTERS	FRAME behind Picard's head so as to protect it, cushion	it, against the hard deck toward which it's	falling...7    PICARD'S POV (OPTICAL)	Riker's face leaning in close...					RIKER			Captain, I've got you; it's			all...	Riker and his surroundings DISSOLVE in a DAZZLE OF	COLORS.

KAMIN MAIN ROOM - DAY	He realizes he's seated in a deep and comfortable chair	in the modest, certainly unusual (to us), but well-kept	and inviting main room of what is apparently a home.	In addition to the front entry, there are openings to	the (o.s.) kitchen and (o.s.) bedroom. Picard just	peers around; confused.					ELINE				(continuing, gently)			How are you feeling?       STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - 3/24/92 - TEASER       4.9    CONTINUED:	As she lightly strokes his face with the moist towel:					ELINE				(gently)			Kamin... can you answer me?	Picard rises to a sitting position, still scanning the	room, a little groggy and disoriented.					PICARD			Where is this... ?	A frown of concern on the woman's face.					ELINE			You're still feverish...	Picard looks around, getting control of his faculties.	Everything he sees is strange, unaccustomed. Might	he be in a holodeck program?					PICARD			Computer, freeze program.				(beat)			End program.	Nothing. The woman keeps moving, trying to blot his	forehead. He gets to his feet, automatically reaching	for his communicator.					PICARD			Picard to Enterprise --	But there is nothing there to hit. He looks down at	his garb -- strange and alien.					ELINE			Kamin, please don't try to get			up yet... you're still not well.					PICARD			I asked you... what is this place?	Her look is of loving concern.					ELINE			This... is your home, of course.	MOVE IN ON PICARD'S FACE, and HOLD, until we...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - 3/24/92 - ACT ONE      5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            10   INT. KAMIN MAIN ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)	Picard and Eline just as they were. He's up and	moving, inspecting the room.					PICARD			Where is my uniform? My			communicator?	She looks truly worried.					ELINE			I'd better call the doctor			again...					PICARD			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of			the Federation Starship			Enterprise. I would like to speak			with whoever is in charge here.					ELINE				(frightened now)			If you'll just lie down, I'll brew			you some nice warm kenomay...					PICARD			Just tell me this -- am I a			prisoner here?	Her eyes widen in alarm.					ELINE			Please, dear... you've had a high			fever for three days... you			mustn't push yourself too			quickly...	Picard has discovered a panel in the wall which	contains a small metallic square in the center. He	touches it, it opens.					ELINE			You shouldn't go outside...	Picard moves to EXIT... a bit cautiously...      STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - 3/24/92 - ACT ONE      6.11   OMITTED12   EXT. COURTYARD FRONTING KAMIN HOME - DAY (CONTINUOUS)	The dwelling is smooth and pale, with the appearance	of a Mediterranean villa. There is a modest front	courtyard with a garden -- now blooming with odd and	alien flora. Picard steps out into the courtyard,	shading his eyes against the bright sunlight; stops	as the door closes behind him to survey the area.	Eline follows him, concerned.					ELINE			Kamin... please come back			inside...	She follows him briefly as he makes his way out of the	courtyard, then stops in frustration, realizing he will	not listen.13   EXT. TOWN SQUARE - HIS POV	More of the white stucco-like dwellings, a square area	in the center where SEVERAL TOWNFOLK have gathered.	A fine-looking, pretty-faced youngish woman crosses	Picard's path en route to the gathered group. She	smiles in recognition, and waves at him as she goes.14   ANGLE ON GROUP (OPTICAL)	as Picard approaches. There is a small group of people	gathered around a man -- BATAI, a genial-looking man	in his 50's -- who is just finishing the planting of	a sapling tree, tamping down the earth and then rising	to address the group.					BATAI			This sapling is planted as an			affirmation of life... in defiance			of the drought and with			expectations of long life.			Whatever comes -- we will keep			it alive, as a symbol of our			survival.	The group applauds... and then Batai spots Picard.					BATAI				(happy relief)			Kamin! You're back on your feet!			How do you feel, my friend?      STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - 3/24/92 - ACT ONE      7.14   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Are you in charge here?	Batai is a bit taken aback by the brusque question.					BATAI			In charge... ?					PICARD			I want to be returned to my ship			immediately.	The group has a reaction to this... exchanging curious	glances. Batai moves closer to Picard.					BATAI			What... ship is that?	The honest confusion in the man frustrates Picard.	He looks around, takes a breath... tries again.					PICARD			Please... if you could tell me...			what is this place? Where am I?					BATAI				(getting it)			The fever... it's taken your			memory.	Picard stares at him... mind working quickly...	frustrated by his inability to get straight answers	from these people. He decides on a different tack.	He smiles a bit ruefully.					PICARD			That must be it. Perhaps you			could help me...					BATAI			Anything, my friend.					PICARD			My name is Kamin... and you are			-- ?					BATAI				(wary, this is strange)			Batai...				(helpful)			Council leader.      STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - 3/24/92 - ACT ONE      8.14   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Ah. And you say I've been ill...					BATAI			For over a week. Eline should've			put you in the hospital, but she			insisted on caring for you			herself.					PICARD			Eline.					BATAI			Your wife. If you don't remember			that, maybe it's safer not to go			home.	Picard allows himself a genial smile. He is at least	getting information.					PICARD			And... what is this place?	Batai becomes wary again, alarmed by his friend's total	memory loss.					BATAI			Perhaps you should see the			doctor...					PICARD			Please -- I'm sure it will come			back to me...					BATAI				(gesturing)			This... is the community of			Ressik. Northern province.					PICARD			What planet?	Batai appears mystified, then comes toward Picard, puts	an arm around his shoulder.					BATAI			Come... let me take you back home.					PICARD			I'm really quite all right. If			you'll just answer...    STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE    9.14   CONTINUED: (3)					BATAI				(carefully)			This is the planet Kataan.					PICARD			Kataan... not a Federation			planet.	Batai looks at him, puzzled. Picard gives the group	a reassuring smile.					PICARD			I think I'll take a walk...	A hesitation.					BATAI			You've been ill for a week...					PICARD			Exercise will do me good. I'd			like to -- re-acquaint myself with			the surroundings.	He gives a nod, then begins to stride purposefully out	of the square. Batai stares after him, as do the	mystified townspeople.15thru	OMITTED1616A  EXT. FIELDS - DAY	Picard roams the hills beyond the town, searching for	clues to his mysterious abduction. He climbs a small	ridge, stares off in the distance, then climbs down and	proceeds on his way.17   OMITTED18   INT. KAMIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT	Eline sits at a small table, idly stirring soup in a	bowl, when she hears something outside. She jumps up,	goes to the door, activates it. Picard is standing	there, bone-weary.					ELINE			Thank goodness...	She ushers him in and he settles in the chair...	grateful to be off his feet.   STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE   10.18   CONTINUED:					ELINE			I've had people out trying to find			you everywhere. Why did you			worry us like that?	He is silent. She tries again.					ELINE			Are you hungry?					PICARD			Hungry, thirsty... weary... I			suppose that proves this isn't			a dream, doesn't it?	She stands, stunned, staring at him.					ELINE			You think this... your life...			is a dream?	The note of anguish in her voice catches him. His	reply is gentle.					PICARD			It's not my life... I know that			much.	Stricken, she blinks away tears, turns to get food.					ELINE			I've kept something hot for you.	He sits at the table and she carries a bowl of soup to	him.					ELINE			Where did you go?					PICARD			I walked. For hours.	He begins eating the soup.					ELINE				(concerned)			And you just out of bed...	She sits opposite him, grateful to have him back,	devotion in her eyes. Picard busies himself with the	soup.					PICARD			This is delicious...   STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE   11.18   CONTINUED: (2)					ELINE				(pleased)			You always say that...	He looks up at her, reminded of his apparent history	with this woman. He decides to approach her head-on.					PICARD			Would you -- answer some questions			for me? No matter how strange			they might seem to you?					ELINE			Of course...					PICARD			Are there other planets in this			star system? Do you visit any			other systems... ?	Shocked, she literally just gapes at him. He reads her	response.					PICARD			All right. Is there any kind of			communication system here? How			do you send messages to... to			other communities? Other places?					ELINE			The usual way... by			voice-transit conductors. Do			you want to send a message?					PICARD			Yes. When can that be arranged?					ELINE				(shrugs)			Tomorrow.				(beat)			Don't you want to ask about...			us?	Picard hears the note of anguish in her voice. He sets	down his spoon, softens.   STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE   12.18   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			Of course. Anything you can tell			me would be helpful. We are...			married?	She nods, clearly in pain that he has no recollection	of this.					ELINE			Three years ago... the happiest			day of my life was the day we got			married.				(beat)			You're probably tired of hearing			it... but I've loved you since			I was seven years old. That's			when I decided I was going to be			your wife, and no one was going			to change my mind.	She smiles at him, reaches out and covers his hand with	hers.					ELINE			I'm glad I was so stubborn...	He stares at her. Her warmth, her sincerity are	obvious. It puts him in an uncomfortable position. He	tries to return to his agenda.					PICARD			What is it that I do... here in			Ressik?					ELINE				(great pride)			You're the best iron weaver in			the community. At least I think			so. You prefer playing the flute,			of course.   STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE   13.18   CONTINUED: (4)					PICARD			The flute?	She rises, goes to a nearby shelf (or whatever) and	brings to him. It is a device much like a	penny-whistle. He holds it, turning it over in his	hands; it is completely unfamiliar.					PICARD			And when did I learn to play it?					ELINE				(laughing again)			I'm afraid you've never learned,			dear. You do keep trying.	Picard puts the device to him mouth... tries a few	notes... it sounds pretty awful. Even Picard can't	help but smile.					PICARD			I see what you mean.	He sets the flute down, rises.					PICARD			Thank you for the soup. And for			your help. Tomorrow will you help			me send a message?	She smiles as though indulging a child. She has him	back... he isn't saying strange things anymore. It's	enough for now.					ELINE			Of course. Will you come to bed			now?	He stares at her. This is a bit awkward. He looks off	toward a door which must lead to a bedroom, then back	at the reclining chair.   STAR TREK: "The Inner Light" - REV. 3/26/92 - ACT ONE   14.18   CONTINUED: (5)					PICARD			I'll sleep here...					ELINE			Oh, no... please come with me...	In her voice, genuine concern. Picard tries diplomacy.					PICARD			I've been sick... I may be tossing			and turning... it wouldn't be fair			to you.					ELINE				(a smile)			Let me be the judge of that.	She moves toward him... stretches her arms to hold	him... and as she does, her dress falls open at the	neck. Picard stares at what he sees.19   OMITTED20   CLOSE - ICON MEDALLION	It is a replica, an exact miniature, of the probe.					PICARD (o.s.)			Where did you get this?21   RESUME - SHOT					ELINE				(taken aback)			It's... the first gift you ever			gave me.22   CLOSE ON PICARD	as he stares at her.23   INT.
