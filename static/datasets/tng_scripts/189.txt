ALIEN MEDICAL FACILITY - CORRIDOR - DAY	CLOSE ON a wide sliding door opening... TWO MALCORIAN	MEDICAL TECHNICIANS rush someone on a gurney through	the doors and into a small room crowded with medical	equipment for emergency trauma care. The level of	technology in evidence is approximately mid 21st	century Earth with just enough differences to tell us	that this is an alien world. There are two treatment	bed/tables, cabinets and trays with medical	instruments, and a display for reading scans. The	Malcorians are humanoid with a slight difference in	facial features... their hands are shaped like mittens	without fingers (and if this is a difficult makeup job,	they can all wear gloves.)	There is a sense of urgency as the Technicians rush the	gurney into the Emergency Room... two young Malcorian	physicians, NILREM (male) and TAVA (female) quickly	move equipment and get a table ready for the incoming	patient. Throughout the following scene, we should	NOT SEE the face of the man lying on the gurney, but	he is in Malcorian civilian garb and has a large	bandage on his head. We may notice he does wear gloves	(mittens) on his hands. They have the gurney in	position and the Technicians help to move the victim	off the gurney and onto the table.					NILREM			Ready... lift!	They all lift and move the victim on the table. The	Technicians now move away and EXIT.       STAR TREK: "First Contact" - 11/28/90 - TEASER       2.1    CONTINUED:	The two doctors move with the smooth efficiency of	hurried professionalism. They begin to attach the	victim to alien emergency equipment...					NILREM			He took a severe blow... possible			trauma to the telencephalon...					TAVA				(examining patient)			Start fifteen octares of			quadroline. We'll need a complete			del-scan series.	Nilrem takes stethoscope-type device and puts it on the	patient's STOMACH. Nilrem listens... frowns...					NILREM				(incredulous)			I can't find his cardial organ...	Tava quickly grabs the patient's wrist...					TAVA			What do you mean? I'm reading			a steady circulation...	Nilrem goes searching for the heart with his scope...	moves it around... finally places it on his chest...					NILREM			There it is... up here...					TAVA			In his digestive tract?					NILREM			Have you ever seen anything like			this... ?	They exchange a puzzled look and then Nilrem gets back	to work as Tava gingerly uses his hands to probe the	man's stomach...					TAVA			He's missing three costal struts			on one side and four on the other...					NILREM			You think that's something... look			at this...     STAR TREK: "First Contact" - REV. 11/30/90 - TEASER     3.1    CONTINUED: (2)	Moving to see Nilrem at the man's feet, having removed	his shoes and socks, showing toes --					NILREM			He has digits on his terminus...	Reactions... they move to his hands and peel off his	gloves... to reveal fingers on his hand... more	reactions. They exchange a look.

Riker	feels the pain in his head...					RIKER			What happened?	A senior physician (BEREL) has joined the group... an	overworked man who doesn't need any more in his life	right now, certainly not an alien in his hospital.					BEREL			You're in the crisis room at the			Sikla Medical Facility. You've			had a severe injury, but you're			going to be all right.	Riker takes this in for a moment... nods again in	understanding. His head hurts terribly.					RIKER			I was caught in the riot when the			police moved in... that's the last			thing I remember.					BEREL			Can you tell us your name?	Riker is careful... it's all starting to come back to	him and he wants to make sure he doesn't say the wrong	thing.					RIKER			Rivas.

I have no family.	He lifts his hand as if to rub his head and then sees	the primitive equipment he's attached to.					RIKER			I can't stay here... I have to			get back...					BEREL			You're in no condition to leave			yet...	Berel studies him with an experienced eye... doesn't	believe Riker's telling the truth... still, using very	good bedside manner, he manages a reluctant grin as	he moves to a more intimate position, perhaps sitting	on the corner of the bed...					BEREL			There are several... unusual			things about your case, Mister			Jakara... your cranial lobes, for			example. They seem to be surgical			implants...					RIKER			I did have some cosmetic			surgery... to correct a genetic			birth defect...	Picking up his hand... looking at the fingers...					BEREL			And these? Another birth defect?     STAR TREK: "First Contact" - REV. 12/6/90 - ACT ONE     6.3    CONTINUED: (3)					RIKER				(acknowledges, of				 course)			Yes, isn't that something? My			father's were the same way...					NILREM				(sharp)			You want us to believe that all			your abnormalities are inherited			genetic traits?	Berel shoots him a look, and Nilrem backs off.					RIKER			I understand your confusion. My			personal physician is much more			familiar with these... genetic			irregularities... to be honest,			I'd feel better if I were back			home under her care...					BEREL			Why don't I talk to her about			that... what's her name?					RIKER				(beat)			Crusher... but actually, I'm not			sure you'll be able to reach her.					BEREL			Why not?					RIKER			She's taking... a sabbatical.	A long look by Berel. Then...					BEREL			Well, we'll do the best we can			for you.	Berel pats him on the wrist, rises. About to leave, a	'Columbo' afterthought...     STAR TREK: "First Contact" - REV. 12/6/90 - ACT ONE     7.3    CONTINUED: (4)					BEREL			Oh, there was one other thing...				(he pulls a phaser out				 of his pocket)			We found this curious looking			device in your clothes... what			is it?					RIKER			Oh, it's just a toy I was taking			home... a present...					BEREL			I thought you didn't have any			family...					RIKER			For a neighbor's child.				(beat)			Did they find anything else, I			had one piece of jewelry... a			metal pin...					BEREL			No, I'm sorry. This was all we			found...	Berel glances at the others, they all leave. Riker	immediately breaks his pretense, looks to the heavens	with an 'oh shoot' look, tries to get up... but pain	shoots through his head and he must retreat back to	bed...4    INT.

Nilrem	finishes it...					NILREM			It's all the space flights...			they've attracted creatures from			outer space...					BEREL			Now, that's exactly the kind of			thing I don't want to hear ... is			that understood?					TAVA			What are you going to do?					BEREL				(sighs)			With all the medical facilities			available, why did he have to end			up here?					NILREM			I think we ought to call Central			Security.					BEREL			I'm not calling anybody yet.

DURKEN'S OFFICE - DAY (OPTICAL)	DURKEN is the leader of his people and this is a	fitting office for a man of his stature, oval shaped	with windows that look outside. Durken himself is in	his fifties, slight in stature, no Ronald Reagan here,	there is a gentle, Woodrow Wilson quality, thoughtful,	brilliant, committed. With him here is MIRASTA, a	woman 30-35 years old, and the Minister for Internal	Security, KROLA. He is older than Durken, with a keen	intellect and piercing eyes. Two other non-speaking	members of the cabinet are present.	Mirasta, the Minister of Science, is displaying a star	chart with some rough animation on a wall monitor...					MIRASTA			At twelve-point-four after launch,			the warp field generator will be			activated...					DURKEN			That's when it would break the			light barrier?					MIRASTA			Yes, Chancellor. If we're			successful, the craft will leave			our star system in a matter of			minutes and will be on its way			toward the Garth system...					KROLA				(non-supportive)			And then what?					MIRASTA				(with a disarming smile)			And then, Krola, we'll see what's			there...					DURKEN			How long, Mirasta?					MIRASTA			We have the prototype design for			the warp engine... it would simply			be a matter of building the			actual production units.

Your			opponents will see this as another			example of your determination to			pull us further from our			traditional ways...	Durken stands, moves as he talks...					DURKEN			My opponents look back as I look			forward. I cannot believe that			my people would choose to retreat			after all we've done...					MIRASTA			I agree.					KROLA			The people were willing to accept			your social reforms because they			believe in you, Chancellor. But			there are many who say we have			gone far enough... all of these			new ideas... new technology...			and now space travel... it			confuses them, frightens them...					DURKEN			And I will not allow them to			remain in the dark ages... the			warp program will proceed as you			have outlined, Mirasta...				(beat, smiles to Krola)			And then we will slow down, Krola,			to let everyone catch their breath			including you...	Krola nods and as they all rise to leave...    STAR TREK: "First Contact" - REV. 11/30/90 - ACT ONE    12.7    INT. MIRASTA'S LAB - DAY (OPTICAL)	From this room, a person can personally supervise and	control rocket launches, satellite operations, radio	and optical telescope functions, receive telemetry,	etc. If the head of NASA wanted to be completely	"hands-on" in the next fifty years, this is the kind	of place he/she would have. There should be computers,	monitors, printers, observational equipment, models	of spacecraft, etc.	Mirasta enters... sits down at one of the computer	monitors and taps in a few commands.	Behind her, Picard and Troi MATERIALIZE. Mirasta	turns in her chair toward the door reacting to the	noise... Picard is dressed in his uniform, Deanna in	conservative civilian garb. They are not posing as	aliens.					PICARD			Excuse me, Mirasta Yale?	She glances at them curiously.					MIRASTA			Yes?					PICARD			My name is Jean-Luc Picard.
