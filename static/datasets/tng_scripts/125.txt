WE CLEARLY SEE THE	REGISTRY NUMBER on her wing -- ten foot tall navy blue	letters reading NCC-1701D.					RIKER (V.O.)			First officer's log, stardate			41775.5. We are en route to the			ocean world known as Pacifica...2    INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE	The mood is relaxed. RIKER is at Command with TROI	beside him. WORF'S at Security, DATA and GEORDI at Ops	and Conn.					RIKER (V.O.)				(continuing)			Our mission is routinely			scientific in nature. We look			forward to seeing the warm blue			waters and fine white beaches that			make Pacifica a treasured jewel			of the galaxy.3    ANGLE ON DATA	intently listening to the punchline of a joke Geordi's	telling...					GEORDI				(grinning)			... So the guy staggers to his			feet and goes back to the girl.			She smiles, looks him right in			the eye and says "Just try that			in hyperspace!"	Geordi LAUGHS at his own joke, but Data is simply	reflective.       STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/9/88 - TEASER       2.3    CONTINUED:					DATA				(thoughtful)			Ah, I see. So the difficulty in			attaining such complex			positioning in a zero gravity			environment, coupled with the			adverse effect it would have on			the psychological well being of			the average human male, is what			makes this anecdote so amusing.			Yes. Very humorous indeed.			Hysterical, in fact.	The look on his friend's face tells Data that something	is missing. Suddenly, he realizes what it is and	bursts into STIFF, FORCED LAUGHTER. It comes out	awkwardly and ends much too abruptly.4    BACK TO WIDE ANGLE	Riker is smiling, having overheard.					RIKER			What's our e.t.a. at Pacifica,			Mister La Forge?					GEORDI			Twenty two hours, fourteen			minutes.					RIKER			Increase to warp six.					GEORDI			Aye sir.					RIKER				(to Troi, mischievous)			Think anyone'll mind if we arrive			a little ahead of schedule?					TROI				(warm smile)			I know I won't. I've been looking			forward to a nice swim.          STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - 3/8/88 - TEASER          3.4    CONTINUED:					DATA			You are aware Counselor, that the			Holodeck can be programed to			recreate an oceanic environment.					TROI			It's just not the same, Data.			Have you ever gone for a real			moonlight swim?					DATA				(deeply puzzled)			One can swim in moonlight?	Troi rolls her eyes and turns to Worf...					TROI			How about you, Worf?					WORF				(shaking head)			Swimming is too much like bathing.					DATA			-- Commander Riker.	Data is monitoring something, looking concerned...					DATA				(continuing)			I am receiving a Code Forty-Seven.	Riker frowns, instantly concerned...					RIKER			Verify.	Data rechecks his console...					DATA				(astounded)			It is a Code Forty-Seven, sir.			Starfleet emergency frequency.	Riker and Troi exchange worried glances...					TROI			Code Forty-Seven...

THE SCREEN by	his bed COMES TO LIFE, awakening the Captain...					RIKER			Riker on the bridge, Captain.			I'm sorry to disturb you.	Picard is still a bit groggy.					PICARD			What is it, Number One?					RIKER			An incoming message -- Code Forty			Seven, sir.	Picard REACTS to the news. He sits up in bed, wearing	a form-fitting sleepsuit (warm and extremely	comfortable).					PICARD			Pipe it through.	A YELLOW LIGHT above the screen FLASHES on and off	signifying that an urgent message is coming through.6    OMITTED7    ON SCREEN	RIKER'S IMAGE IS instantly REPLACED BY THE official	SEAL OF STARFLEET and the United Federation of Planets.	A FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE addresses Picard...					COMPUTER VOICE			This is an emergency communique.			It is not to be discussed with			fellow officers unless deemed			absolutely necessary. There will			be no computer record of said			transmission.					PICARD			Understood.					COMPUTER VOICE			Proceed with voice print			identification.					PICARD			Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain, USS			Enterprise.       STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/9/88 - TEASER       5.7    CONTINUED:	The screen HUMS momentarily...					COMPUTER VOICE			Voice print verified.	The SEAL FADES OUT and a FACE FADES IN... It's the	noble face of WALKER KEEL, a striking middle-aged man	in a Starfleet captain's uniform. He is tall, with	piercing grey eyes and long brown hair just going	silver at the temples.	Picard is clearly shocked, though not displeased, to	see him...					PICARD				(half-whisper)			Walker...					KEEL			Hello, Jean-Luc. Been a long			time.					PICARD			Too long, my friend. Why are you			contacting me on this frequency?					KEEL			It was a difficult decision. I			felt it was worth the risk.					PICARD			Risk?!					KEEL			It's about Starfleet... about			something we've always considered			to be impossible.8    MOVE IN ON PICARD	grimly stunned by his friend's powerful words...9    OMITTED10   INT.

We need			to talk, face to face.					PICARD			You're using a Code Forty-Seven!			I have to know what this is all			about.					KEEL			Not over subspace. No.					PICARD			For God's sake Walker, you know			this is a secure channel --					KEEL			-- No!	For the first time, Keel looks a little over the edge.					KEEL				(continuing)			I want you to meet me on Dytallix B.					PICARD				(thinking it over)			When?					KEEL			Immediately.					PICARD			Impossible. We're expected at			Pacifica --					KEEL			-- That can wait.	Keel's face grows hard...					KEEL				(continuing)			You owe me. And you owe it to			yourself to hear what I have to			say.	Picard is flustered and thoroughly confused. Still, he	is mesmerized by the bleak urgency in Walker's voice...          STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - 3/8/88 - TEASER          7.10   CONTINUED: (2)					KEEL				(continuing; slow,				 measured)			Something's beginning... Have you			felt it?... Creeping out of the			woodwork...				(whisper)			An infestation.10A  BACK TO TWO SHOT					PICARD			What is?	Keel looks long and hard at Picard -- as though	studying his face for some reason.					KEEL			Don't trust anyone. Remember			that, Jean-Luc. Don't take			anything for granted.					PICARD			Walker --					KEEL			-- Dytallix B. We'll be waiting.	KEEL'S IMAGE VANISHES as he ends the transmission.	Picard is left staring at the BLANK SCREEN -- the	YELLOW LIGHT REFLECTING OFF HIS FACE.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT ONE       8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:11   INT.

Dytallix B is one			of seven uninhabited worlds mined			for the Federation by the Dytallix			Mining Company. I believe B is			in the nearby Mira system.					PICARD			Fine. Chart a course for it			immediately, warp seven. And			there will be no records or			logs mentioning any aspect of			this diversion.					RIKER			Captain, they're expecting us at			Pacifica.

THE TUNNEL - ON PICARD	under the barrel of the phasers.					PICARD			This is some greeting, "old			friend."	Keel ignores the comment -- instead STEPPING FORWARD,	empty hands at his sides...					KEEL			Tell me Jean-Luc -- where did we			first meet?	Picard doesn't reply, thinking it ridiculous...					BOLIAN				(tense, waving gun)			Answer the question!      STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT ONE      13.26   CONTINUED:	Picard remains cool -- a thin smile on his lips.					PICARD			On Tau Ceti III. It was a bar --			Quite an exotic one at that.				(looks at Bolian)			What do I win?					KEEL			Do you recall the night you			introduced Jack Crusher to			Beverly?					PICARD			You know full well I hadn't even			met Beverly then. You introduced			them.					KEEL			My brother introduced them.					PICARD				(losing patience)			You don't have a brother -- two			sisters, Anne and Melissa. Now			what the hell's this all about?!	Keel takes a deep breath and nods at the others.	Slowly, they lower their weapons...					RIXX			Apologies, Captain. We had to			make sure you were really you.					PICARD			Walker, what's going on?					KEEL			Captain Picard, meet Captains			Scott and Rixx.	The Bolian offers Picard his pale-blue hand...					PICARD			I believe we've met...

I am.	Picard is impressed by her unblinking honesty. She	comes off confident, not arrogant. Picard addresses	all of them...					PICARD			Starfleet's finest.				(looks around shaft)			Fancy meeting you here.					RIXX			We all came secretly, Picard.			To discuss the threat.					PICARD			What threat?					TRYLA			Have you noticed anything about			Starfleet Command lately?			Anything unusual?					PICARD				(thinking about it)			No. We've been on the outer rim			for awhile. Haven't had much			contact with them.	The other captains look at one another. The RED	SUNLIGHT CASTS EERIE SHADOWS across their faces...					KEEL			Some of us have seen strange			patterns emerging.

Interfleet			communications are at a minimum.			But something is happening.					TRYLA			And we fully expect the Enterprise			to be targeted soon.					PICARD				(incredulous)			Targeted for what? By whom?					KEEL			We're not sure yet.	Picard is clearly skeptical. These people seem to be	chasing shadows. Walker Keel addresses him with	renewed intensity...					KEEL				(continuing)			Dammit Jean-Luc, I tell you that			some of Starfleet's top command			people are changing! This could			affect the very core of our			organization. Officers I've known			for years are bluffing their way			through talk of old times!					RIXX			That's their weakness! A lack			of memory.	Picard turns away, troubled by the picture they're	painting.					TRYLA				(scornful)			He doesn't believe us.

Just vague talk of wild			schemes. Who's behind it, and for			what purpose? How are people			being changed?					KEEL				(softly)			I can't say exactly. But I think			its spread to my own ship.	The WIND MOANS AND HOWLS outside the tunnel, ROCKS AND	SAND CAN BE HEARD SCRAPING against the walls...					KEEL				(continuing)			My first officer hasn't been the			same since we stopped off at			Earth. Our medical officer says			he's perfectly normal, but I don't			think I trust him either.					PICARD				(exasperated)			Walker --					TRYLA			-- We know we don't have all the			answers. All we ask is that you			keep your eyes open.					PICARD			That's sound advice at any time,			Captain.					KEEL			Stay in touch with us -- covertly.			This meeting never took place as			far as Starfleet is concerned.	Keel can tell that Picard is clearly uncomfortable with	this.					KEEL				(continuing)			Please... I'm asking you as a			personal favor.	Reluctantly, Picard gives a slight nod, indicating	agreement. Keel grasps him warmly by the shoulders...         STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - 3/8/88 - ACT ONE         17.26   CONTINUED: (5)					KEEL				(continuing; warm,				 intense)			I'm glad, Jean-Luc...

Such a			terrible loss of life.					PICARD			It's interesting you mention the			Horatio. That's one of the things			I wanted to discuss.					AARON				(dry)			Really?					PICARD			Has the cause of her destruction			been ascertained?					SAVAR			Absolutely.				(looking straight at				 Picard)			Implosion, due to extreme			negligence on the part of her			captain.     STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/11/88 - ACT FOUR     42.74   CONTINUED:	Picard wants to cry out in defense of Keel, but he	realizes that would be a foolish thing to do at the	moment. Aaron gleefully senses his discomfort...					AARON			Drink up, Picard. I believe			you'll find it an excellent			aperitif.75   INT. QUINN'S QUARTERS - QUINN (OPTICAL)	is sitting calmly on the sofa with the unconscious	Riker at his feet when the door OPENS. Worf and Geordi	BOLT IN.					QUINN			It's good that you're here. He			slipped and hit his head.					GEORDI				(into intercom)			This is Lieutenant La Forge in			Guest Quarter Sixteen. We have			a possible medical emergency.					QUINN			Your Doctor Crusher is most			capable; I'm sure he'll be all			right. Now if you'll excuse me,			my time here is limited...	Quinn MOVES TOWARD THE DOOR, but Geordi blocks his	path. Quinn looks to Worf as though he's about to	question what is going on, then quickly flies into	action, LEAPING TOWARD GEORDI. The blind man	BACKPEDDLES, FIRING HIS PHASER directly into the old	Admiral's chest.	Quinn halts, temporarily. Then Geordi and Worf are	stunned to see Quinn BRUSH OFF THE EFFECTS OF THE	PHASER with a simple shake of his head. With amazing	quickness, HE LIFTS GEORDI AND brutally THROWS HIM	into the door. GEORDI GOES OUT the door and HITS THE	FLOOR, unconscious.	This leaves Quinn and Worf to face off over a gaggle	of comatose bodies...					QUINN				(evil smile)			Come on, Klingon. It's just you			and me now...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                                 STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE        43.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:76   INT. QUINN'S QUARTERS - WORF AND QUINN (OPTICAL)	are about to fight it out. Quinn is savagely smug and	barely breathing hard after mopping the floor with	Geordi and Riker. Worf must get over the shock of	seeing an old man with the strength of ten.	The Klingon psyches himself up and CRIES OUT LIKE A	WARRIOR as he makes a move on Quinn. WORF THROWS A	PUNCH that would knock the head off Mike Tyson... It	lands squarely on Quinn's chin, jerking his head to	the side.	Worf can't believe his eyes when QUINN'S HEAD SNAPS	BACK INTO PLACE -- the Admiral is smiling, seemingly	unaffected by the punch.					QUINN			Do Klingons fear death as much			as humans? I could snap your neck			in a second, but that wouldn't			be as much fun.	QUINN GRABS WORF'S STOMACH -- his hands digging deep	into the flesh. WORF BELLOWS in pain as QUINN LIFTS	HIM off the ground by his stomach muscles. The old	man's strength is mind- boggling.	Suddenly a PHASER BLAST HITS QUINN dead on. Mildly	stunned but still standing, he lets go of Worf and	turns to face his new adversary.77   ANGLE ON BEVERLY	standing in the doorway, phaser in hand.78   ANGLE TO INCLUDE QUINN (OPTICAL)	disregarding Worf and moving toward her. SHE FIRES	AGAIN... Halted for an instant, HE MOVES FORWARD...	SHE FIRES AGAIN... Though slowed, HE KEEPS COMING...	SHE FIRES AGAIN... He stiffens, the phaser blasts are	starting to take a toll -- he still moves forward,	nearing her now.      STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT FIVE      44.78   CONTINUED:	Beverly fires again and again, DRIVING HIM TO HIS	KNEES. WORF'S FIST FLIES INTO FRAME, catching the side	of Quinn's head with a powerful smash. QUINN SLUMPS	to the ground, incapacitated at last.	Beverly and Worf are breathing hard, shellshocked by	the battle. Quinn lies quivering at their feet -- his	metabolism racing crazily even though he's unconscious.	Geordi is coming around.					WORF			Are you all right?					GEORDI				(groaning)			If I could see... I'd be seeing			stars.	Geordi sits up. Behind him, Beverly is kneeling over	the unconscious Riker. Worf indicates the twitching	admiral lying before them. The Klingon rubs his sore	stomach and speaks with detectable awe...					WORF			Who... what is he?	Beverly stares at "Quinn" before answering.					BEVERLY			Let's find out.79   INT. SICKBAY - QUINN	lies on a Sickbay bed. Riker can be seen lying	unconscious on a bed in the background. Beverly stands	over Quinn with Worf and Geordi beside her...					BEVERLY				(disturbed)			Retinal scans are an exact match			... It really is Quinn!					GEORDI			How can that be? He picked me			up like a rag doll.      STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT FIVE      45.80   ANGLE FAVORING QUINN	tossing his head back and forth in restless sleep.	Beverly administers a hypo before he can reawaken.	He calms down a bit, his head resting on its side.					BEVERLY			I'm going to run a complete			internal scan.					GEORDI			Keep me posted, Doctor. I'll			be on the bridge.	Geordi EXITS. Beverly is transfixed by something she	spots on the back of Quinn's neck...					BEVERLY				(to Worf)			What is this?	It's a small blue splinter-like thing protruding	slightly from the base of the neck...	Beverly leans down to get a closer look... She	hesitantly reaches forward to touch it... and it moves!81   INT. RECEPTION AREA, EARTH - PICARD	and the two admirals are still waiting to enter the	dining room.					AARON				(trace of a smile)			What do you know of conspiracies,			Captain?					PICARD				(surprised by the				 question)			Not nearly enough I suppose.					AARON			But that's the charming thing			about them, isn't it? When a			machination is real, no one knows			about it. And when it's			suspected, it's almost never real.        STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE        46.81   CONTINUED:					SAVAR			Except of course, in the paranoid			delusions of those who believe.	The dining room doors swing OPEN and Remmick STEPS OUT	and addresses them...					REMMICK			Sorry to interrupt. Dinner is			served.					AARON			Wonderful! Bantering with the			captain has given me quite an			appetite.	They start to move toward the dining room, but Picard	lingers in the hallway...					PICARD			I'd like to contact my ship. To			inform Commander Riker that we're			ready to sit down.	Aaron is about to object to this but Savar cuts him	off, nodding graciously...					SAVAR			Of course, Captain. We'll wait			for you at the table.	Picard waits until the two admirals have gone inside,	before activating his communicator. He speaks in	hushed tones with one eye on the dining room door...					PICARD			Picard to Riker.82   INT. SICKBAY (INTERCUT AS NEEDED) - RIKER	is still dead to the world. Beverly answers for him...					BEVERLY			Doctor Crusher here, Captain.			May I speak freely?					PICARD				(looking around)			I suppose we have no choice.			Where's Riker?          STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT FIVE          47.82   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			He was attacked by Quinn. Or what			We thought was Quinn.					PICARD			Specify, Doctor.83   ANGLE TO SEE QUINN (OPTICAL)	resting fitfully on the bed -- and a large diagram of	his body on the medical screen above it. WE CAN SEE	A STRANGE INSECT-LIKE ANIMAL IS LIVING INSIDE HIM.	It's tendrils have wrapped themselves around the stem	of Quinn's brain.					BEVERLY			A parasitic being has invaded his			body. It has complete control			over all brain functions. It			seems to breath through a small			"gill" protruding through the back			of Quinn's neck. Look for this,			Captain. I believe it will be			visible on anyone who has been			compromised.					PICARD			Any idea what it is or where it			comes from?					BEVERLY			Negative. I've never seen			anything like it before.	WE HEAR GEORDI'S INTERCOM VOICE summoning Worf to the	bridge.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Lieutenant Worf. If the situation			is under control, we could use			you on the bridge.					BEVERLY				(looks to Worf)			It's okay. He won't be waking			up for a long time.	Worf EXITS, leaving Beverly alone with the unconscious	forms of Quinn and Riker.					PICARD			Continue, Doctor.          STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/9/88 - ACT FIVE          48.83   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			By the placement of the tendrils,			the parasite appears to stimulate			the vicim's adrenal glands which			generate great strength and			resistence to --					PICARD			-- Spare me the medical details,			Doctor. Just tell me if you can			remove it.					BEVERLY			Not without killing the patient.	Unseen by Beverly, Riker bolts upright in the bed	behind her. Wild-eyed and seemingly disoriented, he	slowly begins to rise...					BEVERLY			You must set your phaser on kill,			Captain. Stun has little effect --					PICARD			Doctor, one does not beam into			Starfleet Headquarters armed.	Just then, Remmick EXITS the dining room and walks by	Picard...					REMMICK				(as he passes)			Your food is getting cold,			Captain.					PICARD			About to go to dinner now, Doctor.			Have Riker join me when he's			available. Picard out.	Beverly is anxious and doesn't want to terminate the	conversation. Riker is moving up behind her... She	turns and GASPS just as he puts his hand on her	shoulder --          STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE          49.84   INT. DINING ROOM - PICARD (OPTICAL)	is seated across from Aaron and Savar at a polished	black table. Three other settings are unattended --	in front of each is a silver bowl-like covering that	conceals the entree.	A ceremonial guard lines the wall beside the table...					AARON			Go ahead and start, Captain. We			don't stand on ceremony around			here.	Picard removes the lid and is repulsed to find a plate	full of squirming worm-like things -- moving around	like living spaghetti.	Picard quickly pushes his plate away and watches in	abstract horror as Savar and Aaron greedily use their	hands to down their portions of the same living meal.	The Guard MOVES FORWARD and wolfs down a bowl of the	stuff.					AARON				(continuing)			Oh do eat up, Picard. Just raise			your hand if you want seconds.	The admirals and the guards laugh salaciously. The	sight of a Vulcan giggling as he chews on live worms	is too much for Picard to bear.	Jumping to his feet, he turns and runs right into	Number One. Riker roughly shoves the captain back into	his seat.					RIKER			You're not going anywhere.	Picard closes his eyes in dull shock as Aaron walks	to Riker and reveals the blue splinter on the back	of Riker's neck...					RIKER				(continuing;				 to Picard)			You'll be one of us soon.	Riker nods at the others as he sits down at the table.					AARON				(angry)			You were meant for the doctor.             STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE            50.84   CONTINUED:					RIKER			It couldn't be helped. Riker			walked in on us unexpectedly.					SAVAR			No matter. The doctor will soon			be joining us. All in good time.	A door OPENS and Tryla Scott WALKS IN and takes her	place at the table.					SAVAR			Ah, Captain Scott. Good, the			setting is now complete.	It's a bitter blow to Picard when her evil smile lets	him know that she's been one of them all along. She	takes a strand of "live spaghetti" and delicately gulps	it down.					AARON				(to Picard)			You didn't really think we were			in the dark about your intentions,			did you?					SAVAR			Patience is one of our virtues,			Captain. Instead of going after			you, we allowed you to come to			us.					AARON			More dramatic this way, don't you			think?					TRYLA			Yes... one thing both races share			is a love of theatre. And you've			put on a fine show.					PICARD				(shellshocked)			What exactly is your race? Where			do you come from?					SAVAR			It's not important. Let's just			say... we've come a long way to			join you.          STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE          51.84   CONTINUED: (2)					TRYLA				(grinning)			It's a perfect match. We're the			brains and you're the brawn.					RIKER				(cold)			You'll understand soon, Picard.					SAVAR			Indeed. We've been moving slowly,			cautiously, for many months now.			Careful to cover our tracks.			Careful not to arouse suspicion,			until it's too late.					RIKER				(to Picard)			And it is too late. For you, that			is.					AARON			Well said, brother. Picard and			Riker control the Enterprise.			Which means we control the			Enterprise.	Dejected, Picard watches as Riker removes the lid and	takes a big handful of living spaghetti. He tilts his	head back and prepares to swallow it.					SAVAR				(smiling)			Eat hearty, brother! Relish your			new body!	Just as the worms are about to touch his tongue, RIKER	shocks everyone by PULLING A PHASER AND FIRING at the	guard. HE quivers before DROPPING like a fly.	Tryla fires at Riker and misses. Picard seizes the	moment, grabbing the phaser from the unconscious	Guard. Aaron pushes Picard to the ground and BOLTS	FOR THE DOOR. Before Picard can pivot to pick him off,	TRYLA SCOTT JUMPS UP AND takes aim on him. SHE FIRES,	barely missing his head. RIKER CUTS HER DOWN before	she can fire again. Scott quivers and drops. A	PARASITE quickly FLEES her open mouth...          STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE          52.84   CONTINUED: (3)	Meanwhile, Savar has charged Riker and has him in a	death grip around the throat. PICARD FIRES INTO THE	VULCAN'S BACK...	The VULCAN drops to his knees, finally releasing his	grip. He falls over, dead.	Still holding his throat, Riker reaches back and	removes the counterfeit splinter from his neck.	Suddenly, both he and Picard have the same thought...					PICARD			Aaron!85   INT. GREAT HALLWAY - AARON (OPTICAL)	is desperate, running straight toward us down the long	hallway. Far behind, Picard and Riker come around a	corner and take aim...					RIKER				(calling out)			Hold it, Aaron!	Aaron spins and FIRES -- Picard and Riker dive out of	the way. The Admiral keeps running... he's almost at	the end of the hall... RIKER AND PICARD FIRE, scoring	two direct hits. AARON WINCES AND GOES DOWN. His	momentum sends him sliding along the smooth floor.86   ANGLE ON PICARD AND RIKER (OPTICAL)	running up to the body. They get there just in time	to see the PARASITE evacuating it. Before they can	fire, it SCURRIES AROUND THE CORNER and out of sight.					PICARD				(to Riker)			Come on!87   INT. ANOTHER SECTION OF HALLWAY - PICARD AND RIKER	cautiously turn the corner. In the distance, they see	the CREATURE SLITHER UNDER A DOOR...	Hurrying to the door, they give each other a long look,	knowing that anything could be behind it. At last,	Riker touches a wall panel and the door slides OPEN...             STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - 3/8/88 - ACT FIVE            53.88   ANGLE INTO THE ROOM	where Remmick is tapping on an unknown object similar	to a typewriter. A HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING SOUND is	emanating from it... Remmick looks up at Riker and	Picard, his face a mask of calm innocence.					REMMICK			Can I help you, gentlemen?	Picard and Riker aren't sure just what to make of this.	Remmick seems so placid and unconcerned.					REMMICK			Is there any trouble? Perhaps			if you'd tell me what it is --					PICARD			-- Remmick!	Picard is pointing to a PARASITE that is beginning to	CLIMB UP REMMICK'S LEG. Riker raises his phaser,	preparing to fire on it, but Picard blocks that with	his forearm					PICARD			No, Will!88A  ANGLE FAVORING REMMICK (OPTICAL)	looking on wide-eyed, as the Parasite climbs up his	arm and onto his shoulder. Picard and Riker are	momentarily paralyzed, unsure of what to do.	Remmick looks from the creature to the two Officers	with a stoic expression on his face. Then, in a	strange almost lizard-like movement, he rolls his head	to the side and opens his mouth. In an instant, the	PARASITE SCAMPERS INTO HIS MOUTH and down his throat.	Remmick addresses the stunned Picard and Riker as	though nothing of consequence had happened...					REMMICK				(calm, sincere)			You don't understand.	As he speaks, his NECK BULGES as some of the creatures	dart around inside it...					REMMICK				(voice distorted)			We mean you no harm. We seek			co-existence.          STAR TREK: "Conspiracy" - REV. 3/14/88 - ACT FIVE         54.88A  CONTINUED:	Remmick is slowly starting to rise... Picard and Riker	look at each other as if to say "freak this!" They OPEN	FIRE, DRIVING REMMICK BACK down into his chair.	The upper half of REMMICK'S BODY BEGINS TO DISSIPATE	under the phaser fire... A bizarre form is taking its	place. Shaped vaguely like a man, IT LOOKS LIKE A	liquidy BUBBLE WITH HUNDREDS OF PARASITES swarming	around inside it.	The BUBBLE BEGINS TO COLLAPSE down into what used to be	Remmick's lower abdomen. Another SHAPE IS REVEALED as	the gooey mass collapses. It is dull yellow -- looking	LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN A PARASITE AND A HUMAN FETUS.	It looks at Picard and Riker and CRIES OUT WITH AN	ANGRY ROAR. Picard and Riker concentrate on its head	and SCORE A DIRECT HIT between the eyes... The	FETUS-CREATURE EXPLODES AND THE PARASITES DISSIPATE	into nothingness...	Picard and Riker CEASE FIRING. All that's left before	them is a smoldering mass -- a pair of legs and part	of a spine that used to be Dexter Remmick...89   EXT.
