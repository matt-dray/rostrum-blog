	FADE IN:

A1	EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	Travelling at standard warp.

B1	INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS

	RIKER, DATA, TROI and WORF are playing five-card draw
	poker, Riker dealing. Riker and Data have similarly
	large piles of chips in front of them. It looks like
	Troi and Worf are down to mortgaging the farm. Worf
	stares at his hand -- his poker face leaves a lot to
	be desired.

					WORF
				(scowls)
			One.

					RIKER
				(baiting him)
			Worf. Are you trying to fill
			another inside straight?

	Worf grunts.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Don't say I didn't warn you.

	Riker deals him a card. Worf takes a look and folds.

					WORF
			Pah.

					TROI
				(to Riker)
			I fold.


        STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/24/90 - TEASER        1A.

B1	CONTINUED:

	Riker looks at Data, who carefully adds two chips,
	followed by three more.

					DATA
			I will raise you three.

					RIKER
			No cards?

	Riker reacts as Data answers with an utterly unreadable
	look.

					RIKER
				(to others)
			Best poker face I've ever seen.

	Riker stares at Data for a beat.

					RIKER
			Dealer takes two.

	Riker deals himself two cards. Stares at them for a
	moment. Adds five chips to the pile. Then five more.
	He looks at Data.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Raise you ten.

	Without hesitation, Data counts out ten chips, then
	twenty more.

					DATA
			I will see your bet, and raise
			you twenty.

	Riker smiles.

					RIKER
			Data. Are you sitting on a full
			house or a flush?

					DATA
			It will cost you twenty to make
			that determination, Sir.

        STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/18/90 - TEASER        1B.

B1	CONTINUED: (2)

	Riker stares at him for a few beats. Smiles and tosses
	in his cards.

					RIKER
			Dealer folds.

	Data calmly pulls in the chips. Both Troi and Worf
	push back from the table -- finished for the night.
	Troi looks at the chips in front of Riker and Data,
	now even more evenly matched.

					TROI
				(teasingly)
			You two have successfully split
			the evening between yourselves.

					WORF
			I suspect conspiracy. But far
			be it for me to accuse my superior
			officers.

	Riker laughs. Looks at Data.

					RIKER
			It's getting harder to bluff you,
			Data. You've learned this game
			well.

					DATA
			Yes sir, I believe I have.

	Riker reshuffles the deck of cards, considering Data
	as he does so.

					RIKER
			Tell you what.

	He fans out the cards on the table. Troi and Worf
	stick around to see what he's up to, as Riker pushes
	his entire pile of winnings towards Data.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			I'll bet you I can find a card
			that you bury anywhere in this
			deck. And furthermore, I'll make
			you help me do it.

	Data considers the challenge for a moment.

        STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/18/90 - TEASER        1C.

B1	CONTINUED: (3)

					TROI
			Careful, Data.

					DATA
			Your guidance is much valued,
			Counsellor. However...

	Data pushes his chips into the betting pot. Troi
	laughs. Data selects a card.

					RIKER
			Don't let me see it.

	Data pulls it up towards his face. Troi and Worf
	adjust their positions to be behind Data, so that they
	too can see the card.

C1	CLOSE UP THE CARD

	The Jack of Hearts.

					RIKER (O.S.)
			Now lose it in the deck.

D1	RESUME

	Data does so, and Riker quickly shuffles and plops the
	deck right down in front of Data.

					RIKER
			Cut the deck into two halves.

	Data does so, making two halves. Riker takes one half
	away, discarding it.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Again.

	Data again makes two halves with what's left. Riker
	again takes one away.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Once more.

	Same procedure.

        STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/18/90 - TEASER        1D.

D1	CONTINUED:

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			How many cards are left?

	Data fans them slightly, counting as he does so.

					DATA
			Eleven.

					RIKER
			Pick five.

	Data does so.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Throw them away.

	Data puts them aside. Six remain in front of them.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Choose three.

	Data does so.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Now pick one of those.

	Data picks one.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Turn it over.

	Data does so -- it is the Jack of Hearts. Troi and
	Worf appear astonished.

					RIKER
				(knowing the answer)
			Is that your card?

					TROI
			Incredible.

	Riker smiles and moves to pull the large pile of chips
	towards his side of the table.

        STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/18/90 - TEASER        1E.

D1	CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA
			You surreptitiously placed the
			edge of your left thumb onto the
			card immediately after I inserted
			it back into the deck. When you
			divided the deck to reshuffle,
			you kept that card on top. You
			thus were able to have me either
			discard or save depending on the
			card's location, which you
			followed at each step. Until we
			were left with one -- the card
			I originally chose.

	Riker scowls, beaten. Data reaches his arms out and
	starts pulling the pile of chips towards his side.

					DATA
			Sir, I think under the
			circumstances...

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Picard to Riker.

					RIKER
				(to com)
			Captain?

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			We've received a distress call.
			Changing course to intercept...

1    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	Speeding at high warp through space.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, stardate 44215.2.
			The Enterprise has bypassed its
			scheduled archaelogical survey
			of Camus Two in response to a
			distress call from a Federation
			freighter. The Arcos has assumed
			an emergency orbit around Turkana
			Four, birthplace of our late
			comrade Tasha Yar.

2    INT. BRIDGE

	PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF and TROI at their stations.
	A supernumerary is at the Conn.

					DATA
			We will enter the Turkana system
			in eleven minutes, Captain.

					PICARD
			Engine status.

					DATA
			Stable. But we have maintained
			warp factor nine for longer than
			is recommended.

	Picard notes Data's report with a nod.

					WORF
			Subspace message from the Arcos.
			Their transmitter is failing, sir.
			Audio only.

					PICARD
			Let's hear it.

         STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/28/90 - TEASER         2.

2    CONTINUED:

	Worf touches a control and the voice of crewman TAN TSU
	is heard on audio, fuzzing in and out of a rough
	transmission.

					TAN TSU'S VOICE
			Enterprise, this is Tan Tsu, Arcos
			engineer. Estimate five minutes
			till warp drive containment
			breach.

	A small explosion can be heard in the background,
	momentarily disrupting the audio. It returns with even
	less quality than before.

					TAN TSU'S VOICE
				(continuing)
			Make that three minutes. Thanks
			for trying, Enterprise...

	The transmission fritzes out completely. Picard
	reacts, turns to the supernumerary.

					PICARD
			Warp nine-point-three, Ensign.

	The supernumerary works the controls. The ship hums
	around them.

					PICARD
			How much time?

					DATA
			Seven minutes and fifteen seconds
			will bring us within transporter
			range.

					PICARD
			Go to warp nine-point-six.

	The supernumerary touches the controls.

			Aye, Captain.

	Picard glances at the Conn.

			Drop to impulse.

	The ensign at Conn takes the ship out of warp.

			Visual contact.

				(to com)
			Get them out of there, O'Brien.

	A field of stars and a reddish planet, Turkana Four.
	We're close enough to barely make out in the far

	watch, the ship explodes in what from this distance,
	looks like a delicate, silent, flash of color.

					RIKER
			O'Brien, status!

	O'Brien at the instrument panel.

					O'BRIEN
				(to com)
			There's nothing to lock onto,
			Commander.

8    INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	The bridge crew reacts.

					DATA
			I am reading an ion trail
			characteristic of a freighter
			escape pod.

	Data continues working his instrument panel. Worf is
	working his controls as well.

					WORF
				(to Picard)
			Unable to establish contact.

					PICARD
			It could have been damaged by the
			explosion. They may have been
			incapable of maintaining orbit.

					RIKER
			Let's hope they stay clear of the
			colony.

	Data looks up from his instruments.

					DATA
			That is exactly where the ion
			trail leads, Commander.

					PICARD
			Hail the colony.

         STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/28/90 - TEASER         5.

8    CONTINUED:

	A beat. Riker looks concerned.

					WORF
			I've been trying to, Captain...
			No response.

					RIKER
				(to Picard)
			There haven't been reliable
			communications since the
			government fell apart.

					DATA
			The last Federation vessel to
			attempt contact was the Potemkin
			six years ago. They were warned
			that anyone transporting down to
			the colony would be killed.

	A beat.

					PICARD
			Ready your away team, Number One.

	Picard stares with concern at the red planet on the
	viewscreen in front of him.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			are in orbit above Turkana Four,
			an Earth colony that severed
			relations with the Federation
			nearly fifteen years ago. I am
			concerned about sending an away
			team, but if we are to discover
			the fate of the two missing
			Federation crewmen, I see no
			alternative.

10   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)

	Riker, Data and Worf are entering the transporter room.
	O'Brien is at his controls. Beverly is waiting for
	them, medical kit in hand. Worf seems concerned with
	her presence.

					DATA
			The surface settlement appears
			to be all but destroyed. Sensors
			show that the colonists now live
			in structures that extend nearly
			three kilometers beneath the city.

					RIKER
			Have you located the escape pod's
			landing point, Chief?

					O'BRIEN
			Yessir... three hundred meters
			beyond the colony perimeter...

	Riker nods. Worf turns to him.

					WORF
				(re: Beverly)
			Sir, we can anticipate a violent
			response to our presence.

					WORF (Cont'd)
			Perhaps the Doctor should wait
			here for our signal.

					BEVERLY
				(an edge)
			I appreciate the concern. But
			I think it's exaggerated.

					WORF
			Doctor, the colony is completely
			lawless. Lieutenant Yar spoke
			of rape gangs...

					BEVERLY
			Mister Worf, I can handle myself.

					RIKER
				(a decision)
			She's coming. The Arcos crewmen
			may require immediate medical
			assistance.

	Worf nods. Riker pulls his phaser, adjusts the
	setting.

					RIKER
			Phasers on maximum stun.

	The away team members step onto the transporter pads
	and take out their phasers, adjusting the settings.
	When they are set, with phasers in firing position --

	O'Brien works the controls and the away team
	DEMATERIALIZES.

	Bronx.

12   INT. ENTRANCE TO TUNNEL

	A wide, partially fallen-in tunnel. The away team
	ENTERS cautiously from outside, phasers ready. Data is
	reading his tricorder.

					DATA
			The dispersion trail continues
			in this direction.

	He stops to double-check his readings. Then turns
	slightly with the tricorder, pointing with it.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			The concentration gradient
			definitely increases along this
			vector.

	He indicates a direction.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			The escape pod was apparently
			moved into the tunnels ahead of
			us.

	WORKMEN walk by carrying several cannisters. They give
	the away team half-a-look, avoid them, and go on with
	their business. Several CIVILIAN-LOOKING INDIVIDUALS
	approach from the other direction, again giving the
	away team a wide berth and attempting no contact. It
	suggests a city street. Pedestrian traffic.

	The Federation officers seem surprised, and lower their
	phasers. Riker glances towards Worf.

        STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/30/90 - ACT ONE        8.

12   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Not the response we expected.

					BEVERLY
			Maybe things have changed here.

	Suddenly, all hell breaks loose around them. Alarms go
	off; the three workmen dive for cover; FOUR COALITION
	MEN and ONE COALITION WOMAN in their early to
	mid-twenties come hurrying around a corner.

	One is carrying a small crate in his arms, one of the
	others has a phaser, the remaining three carry
	nightstick-looking devices. The garments worn by three
	of them are torn in several places, as if in a fight
	that just happened. One of the men looks seriously
	injured, though still on his feet and moving; his shirt
	is torn across his chest. In the flurry of activity,
	we may notice a diamond-shaped bright orange/yellow
	solid glow, about an inch in diameter, on a spot under
	their garments just below the collar bone.

	They stop dead in their tracks, completely surprised at
	the sight of the away team directly in front of them,
	phasers now raised. The newcomers assume a ready
	stance with their weapons. The injured man slumps to
	his knees. Beverly goes to assist. She begins to
	examine the wounds.

					MAN #1
			Identify yourselves.

					RIKER
			We're from the Federation Starship
			Enterprise. We tracked two
			crewmen to this area. Do you know
			anything about them?

					MAN #1
			Possibly.

	The others in his group are glancing anxiously around.

					RIKER
			What do you mean?

					MAN #1
			It depends on what you have to
			offer in return.

12C  ANGLE ON THE WOUNDED MAN

	as his diamond-shaped orange/yellow glow suddenly
	pulses beneath the skin -- right where his shirt has
	been ripped open. Almost as one body, the group
	suddenly turn towards a corridor opening. The other
	Coalition members are pulsing as well.

					MAN #1
			They found us.

12D  RIKER AND WORF

	react to the pulsing, glance at each other.

					WORF
				(to Riker, re: the glow)
			Proximity detectors. I've seen
			them used on Manu Three.

	A beat later we hear shouting and a couple of phasers
	firing from the corridor.

					MAN #1
				(to Riker)
			Follow me.

	He and his group take off down an opposite corridor.
	Riker pauses for a moment, makes a decision.

					RIKER
			Come on.

	The away team follows quickly after them.

	(NOTE: re the detectors: whenever a gang member is in
	foreign territory, it glows. When an enemy begins to
	approach, it pulses.)

	The away team stands in front of him, surrounded in
	the background by several male and female Coalition
	members who don't appear particularly threatened by
	their appearance. Since the members are back in their
	own territory, the orange/yellow glows are no longer
	activated, and are therefore invisible. Man #1 is
	near Hayne.

					HAYNE
				(to Riker)
			The Alliance is holding your men
			hostage, Commander Riker, not
			us. You can expect a ransom
			demand...

					RIKER
			The Alliance?

					HAYNE
			Our good friends.

	Some of his comrades give a low laugh. Hayne pulls
	out of the box a bottle of what looks like liquor.

					HAYNE
				(to his gang)
			Our "good friends" are going to
			be upset when they realize we took
			their last crate of Telluridan
			synthale.

	More laughter. Riker looks impatient.

					RIKER
			Maybe it would be easier if I
			contacted the authorities.

					HAYNE
				(flash of anger)
			We are the "authorities."

	Hayne quickly recovers his cool. Sets down the bottle
	and picks up one of the nightstick weapons, called a
	STUNSTICK, pointing it at a schematic wall-hanging of
	the city below the ground. The city is shaped like a
	sunken pyramid with the base at the lowest depth.

					HAYNE
				(continuing)
			The Coalition -- our cadre -- runs
			this side of the city. The
			Alliance controls the other. Take
			your choice.

					RIKER
			Are you offering to help?

13   CONTINUED: (3)

					HAYNE
				(nodding)
			In return for some...
			consideration. Phasers are in
			short supply down here. A
			starship isn't going to miss a
			few.

	Worf grunts with distrust.

					WORF
			That is no better than a ransom
			demand.

					HAYNE
			No matter what you give the
			Alliance, they'll eventually kill
			your crewmen anyway. With our
			help there's at least a chance
			you'll get them back alive.

	A beat. Hayne senses their hesitation.

					HAYNE
			All we're asking for is help in
			maintaining our defense. We're
			trying to keep the peace.

	Riker glances at the stolen crate, looks doubtful.

					RIKER
			Everything we've seen suggests
			otherwise.

	Hayne indicates the crate with a dismissive gesture.

					HAYNE
			A prank. The proximity implants
			prevent either side from doing
			any serious damage.

	Hayne taps the spot just below the center of his collar
	bone. Then he indicates the map.

					HAYNE
				(continuing)
			They warn us when an enemy is
			approaching.

13   CONTINUED: (4)

					WORF
			Then why do you need more phasers?

					HAYNE
			The Alliance just discovered a
			large cache of weapons. I just
			want to make things even.
			Preserve the peace.

					BEVERLY
			You keep using the word "peace."
			We've heard a different version
			of life on Turkana Four.

					HAYNE
				(bristling)
			Ancient history.
				(a beat)
			Where did you hear that?

					DATA
			A former crewmember was born here.

	Hayne considers that for a moment.

					HAYNE
			Where's he now?

					DATA
			She was killed in the line of
			duty.

					HAYNE
				(shrugs)
			That's as good a way to die as
			any.

	Hayne has inadvertently hit a nerve, but Riker does
	his best to hide it.

					HAYNE
				(continuing)
			As I said -- ancient history.
			This is now. And your men are
			in trouble.

        STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/23/90 - ACT ONE        13.

13   CONTINUED: (5)

					RIKER
			We'll return to the Enterprise
			and consider your proposal.

	Hayne nods his acceptance. Then steps over and hands
	the bottle of synthale to Riker.

					HAYNE
			A gift for your Captain.

	Data quickly scans it with the tricorder, finding
	nothing amiss. Riker touches his insignia.

					RIKER
			Riker to Enterprise. Energize.

	The away team DISAPPEARS into the transporter beam.
	When they're gone, Hayne turns to his second-in-
	command.

					HAYNE
			I want everything there is to
			know about the starship
			Enterprise.

14   INT. BRIDGE

	Picard is examining the bottle from the colony; the
	away team is back and standing nearby. Bridge crew
	consists of Riker, Data, Worf, Beverly, Troi, and a
	supernumerary at the Conn.

					RIKER
				(re: the bottle)
			According to Hayne, the Coalition
			and the Alliance raid each other
			for supplies -- much of it
			non-essential.

					PICARD
			Why?

					WORF
			A battle exercise.

					RIKER
				(nodding)
			Their defenses apparently prevent
			deep strikes into each other's
			territory. Minor skirmishes are
			all that's left.

        STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT ONE        14.

14   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			"Coalition", "Alliance" -- it all
			sounds so reasonable. But you've
			described the behavior of urban
			street thugs. We certainly won't
			trade weapons for the crewmen.
				(beat)
			How do you suggest we deal with
			them?

	Picard sets down the bottle.

					RIKER
			We have to tell them something.

					WORF
			No promises. No denials.

					PICARD
				(nods in agreement)
			For now, Hayne's Coalition is our
			only safe access to the colony.
			Let's keep the door open and see
			where it leads.

	Worf glances down at his instrument panel.

			On screen.

	The crew is staring at the viewscreen.

19   ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (INTERCUT AS NEEDED) (OPTICAAL)

	Hayne and Ishara looking at the crew.

					HAYNE
			There's an old saying, Captain.
			"The enemy of my enemy is my
			friend." I've decided it's in
			my best interest to help you get
			your men back.

					PICARD
			With nothing from us in return?

					HAYNE
			You could be forced into paying
			my adversary a ransom in weapons.
			I'll do anything I can to avoid
			that possibility.

					PICARD
			What do you propose?

					HAYNE
				(indicating Ishara)
			Ishara will be our liaison.

					ISHARA
			I know Alliance territory. I can
			help you with a rescue plan.

	A beat.

					PICARD
			One moment.

	Picard signals Worf to mute the channel.

					WORF
			Mute.

20   RESUME BRIDGE

	As Picard turns to his officers.

					PICARD
			Reactions?

					WORF
			I do not trust him.

					RIKER
			She could be a fake. We mentioned
			that a former member of the crew
			had come from the colony.

					BEVERLY
				(nodding)
			All Hayne had to do was search
			through whatever their database
			had on Starfleet to come up with
			Tasha's name.

					PICARD
			Counsellor?

					TROI
			He's being deceptive, and he's
			clearly hoping to manipulate us.
			As for the young woman's identity,
			I can't tell.

	Picard considers for a moment, makes a decision.

					PICARD
			Regardless, this is an option we
			cannot neglect. We'll continue
			on other fronts as they present
			themselves. For now, let's see
			what she has to say.

	Picard turns to Worf, who touches his panel.

22   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)

	CLOSE ON Ishara, MATERIALIZING on the transporter pad.

	Data is waiting for her when she steps off. She takes
	note of his appearance.

					DATA
			Welcome to the Enterprise, Ishara.
			I am Commander Data.

					ISHARA
			You're not human.

					DATA
			I am an android.

	Ishara glances at him.

					ISHARA
			Built for fighting... ?

					DATA
				(reacts)
			On what do you base that
			assumption?

					ISHARA
			A cybernetic device serving on
			a starship...

					DATA
			The Enterprise is not a ship of
			war. It is a ship of
			exploration.

	This doesn't particularly intrigue her -- in fact, she
	seems on the whole somewhat emotionally disconnected.
	NOT HARSH -- just missing something. Though there is
	an undercurrent of woundedness or vulnerability beneath
	it all that she does her best to hide.

					ISHARA
			The first thing to do is help you
			map the colony.
				(takes out chip)
			This is a general grid of the
			tunnel systems. I can fill in
			the specific details from memory.

       STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/30/90 - ACT TWO       18A.

22   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			My orders are to escort you to
			the Observation Lounge. We will
			proceed from there.

	She nods assent, and they head for the door.

23   INT. CORRIDOR

	Data and Ishara are walking away from the transporter
	room.

					DATA
			Your sister never spoke of you.

					ISHARA
			That's not surprising.

	Data glances at her.

        STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/24/90 - ACT TWO        19.

23   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			It is surprising to me. Tasha
			and I spent much time together
			in the course of our duties. We
			had a considerable number of
			conversations.

	Ishara studies him for a moment.

					ISHARA
			Did she talk at all about the
			colony?

					DATA
			Only to say that she was lucky
			to have escaped.

					ISHARA
				(matter of factly)
			It wasn't luck. It was cowardice.

	Data looks surprised.

					DATA
			"Cowardice" is a term that I have
			never heard applied to Tasha.

	She glances at him -- a shift of the head and a look
	in her eyes that Data seems to recognize. She picks
	up on it.

					ISHARA
			Is something wrong?

					DATA
			No. It is just that for a
			moment, the expression on your
			face was reminiscent of your
			sister.

	This seems to strike a place of vulnerability in her,
	but she covers it immediately, turning away from him,
	and speaking in her even, unemotional tone.

					ISHARA
			It's been fifteen years. I don't
			even remember what she looked
			like...

24   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE

	The door slides open and Data ENTERS with Ishara.

24A  ANGLE ON THE SENIOR STAFF

	Waiting in the room. Picard, Riker, Troi, Geordi,
	Beverly. They can't help but stare at her for a couple
	of silent beats -- almost as if looking for some sign
	of Tasha.

24B  RESUME

	Ishara reacts to their gaze.

					ISHARA
			You don't believe I'm Tasha's
			sister.

					PICARD
			We have considered that
			possibility.

					ISHARA
			I'm not surprised. You can
			sample my DNA if you like.

					BEVERLY
			Thank you, I will.

	Picard indicates a chair.

					PICARD
			Please. Sit down.

	Ishara takes a seat, Data does the same. Troi studies
	her carefully, trying to get a sense of her.

					PICARD
			Perhaps it would help if you gave
			us some idea of what we're dealing
			with on Turkana Four. Our last
			information describes a colony
			in complete disarray.

					ISHARA
			It started falling apart almost
			thirty years ago. There were
			dozens of factions. They fought
			until the city above ground was
			in ruins.

					RIKER
			The Coalition and the Alliance
			are all that's left?

       STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT TWO       20A.

24B  CONTINUED:

					ISHARA
				(nodding)
			We were the two strongest
			factions... When the government
			couldn't stop the violence, they
			gave us police powers. The
			proximity detectors were
			originally designed by the
			government to keep us under
			control.

					PICARD
			Apparently, that part of the plan
			didn't succeed very well.

					ISHARA
			No. After a few months, we
			didn't need the government any
			more.

			Tasha left you in the middle of

	A beat. Ishara's voice grows quieter.

					ISHARA
			She didn't abandon me, if that's
			what you mean. Tasha asked me
			to go with her. But I had
			already joined the Coalition.
			They were my family.

	The group reacts to her admission. She looks at
	Picard, voice still quiet, doing her best to hide her
	difficulty with this subject.

					ISHARA
				(continuing, to Picard)
			Captain, we don't have a lot of

26   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

					ISHARA
			Take that threat seriously,
			Captain. They'll torture them
			and then they'll kill them. My
			cadre has never recovered a
			hostage alive from the Alliance.

	She has everyone's attention.

					ISHARA
				(continuing)
			Your crewmen could be held in any
			number of places. The Alliance
			has two main headquarters and
			thirteen ancillary bases of
			operation. All underground. All
			heavily guarded.

					GEORDI
			If I could get to the myographic
			scanner...

					ISHARA
			What's that?

					DATA
			A sensing device on the escape
			pod. It monitors the bio-electric
			signatures of the crew. In the
			event they get separated from the
			pod.

					GEORDI
			I could install a booster on the
			device that would relay its
			signals to the Enterprise. Then
			we could track the men from up
			here.

					PICARD
			Unfortunately, we don't know where

28   PULL BACK TO INCLUDE

	Riker, Data, Geordi, Worf and Ishara gathered around
	a large flat screen, as Ishara indicates various

	they are deep in "work" mode.

					ISHARA
			... and here.

	They lean back from the table screen.

					RIKER
				(pointing)
			We could transport an away team
			right into this intersection...

					ISHARA
			Don't underestimate them,

			that... I've seen them use this
			kind of strategy before.

	Riker gives her a questioning look.

					ISHARA
				(continuing)
			I know it looks isolated and

			is they have hundreds of men on
			the levels above and below
			waiting for you to make your

			Transport a couple of photon

			That won't give us enough time.

			install the relay.

	A beat. Ishara indicates the map.

					ISHARA
			Transport me into this corridor.
			My magnetic implant will set off

			Too dangerous. We've seen what

	A beat on a silent, deserted tunnel. Ishara suddenly
	MATERIALIZES, phaser drawn. As soon as the Transporter
	beam clears, the implant beneath her collar bone begins
	to glow its characteristic bright orange/yellow.
	Simultaneously, a piercing alarm goes off in the tunnel
	around her.

29C  INT. CHAMBER - ESCAPE POD (OPTICAL)

	The Alliance guards at the pod appear dumbfounded at
	the alarm wailing distantly offscreen. It is followed
	by a second. And a third.

	Three more Alliance members come running in from
	adjoining tunnels, confused about what's happening.

	The female guard motions to them to follow her, and
	they all run toward the alarms, weapons ready, leaving
	the two male guards behind at the pod.

	Riker, Data and Worf simultaneously come out from
	behind a slight wall and stun the two remaining men.
	Geordi steps out carrying a toolkit-sized box of
	equipment.

	They all head straight for the escape pod. When they
	get there, Riker, Data, and Worf stand guard as Geordi
	reaches underneath with the equipment.

	suddenly begins to pulse. She immediately runs in the
	opposite direction.

	As she disappears around a corner, the four Alliance
	members arrive from the left.

	They cautiously move forward. One of the Alliance
	members pauses at the corner and shifts towards the
	left -- a diamond shape below his collar bone suddenly
	pulses GREEN. (As with Ishara, his shirt is open
	enough at the neck to expose the spot. The other
	Alliance members are pulsing GREEN beneath their
	shirts.)

	He silently indicates the others to fan out as they
	head after her, splitting up behind the various low
	walls and projections and debris as they do so.

35   INT. ADJOINING CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)

	Ishara is creeping along behind a series of
	projections, the alarms blaring around her. She
	suddenly stops dead in her tracks, as her implant
	pulses orange/yellow. She whips around -- the guard
	has just stepped from behind a low wall. Ishara aims
	her phaser too late -- the guard swings his stunstick,
	which lets out a bright, crackling arc flash that hits
	Ishara across the ribcage, sending her flying across
	the floor, her phaser fire rainbowing across the air
	as she goes.

	The guard quickly advances as Ishara tries in a daze to
	struggle to her feet, reaching her and aiming the
	stunstick right at her face -- only to fall to the
	ground, stunned by a phaser blast.

36   INCLUDE RIKER (OPTICAL)

	As he starts to hurry across to Ishara -- and is
	suddenly fired upon by two men from behind a
	projection. Riker returns fire continuously, as a
	still dazed Ishara attempts to stand. He reaches her
	and hauls the barely conscious woman into the next
	tunnel -- touching his insignia with his free hand as
	he goes.

			Come.

	The door opens and Riker ENTERS.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			How is she?

					RIKER
			A couple of cracked ribs, but

					PICARD
			Doctor Crusher just called me with

			Ishara is Tasha's sister.

					RIKER
			After what she did for us down

					PICARD
				(a beat)
			You took some unnecessary personal

	Riker pauses for a moment before answering.

					RIKER
			We lost Tasha on an away mission,

			her sister...

	Picard nods sympathetically.

					PICARD
			That's an emotional response,
			Will. We can't afford that.

39A  INT. SICKBAY

	Ishara is sitting on a diagnostic bed, as Beverly runs
	a rectangular device that looks vaguely like a medical
	version of a phaser over the side of Ishara's ribcage.

					BEVERLY
			I've fused the bone tissue along

	She takes the instrument down. The door slides open
	and Picard ENTERS.

				(continuing)
			The muscles around the area will

	Beverly nods to him as she heads offscreen towards the

					PICARD
			I wanted to thank you personally

			I expected.

					ISHARA
				(darker)
			I don't run away when things get
			tough, like some people do...
			like my sister did...

	A beat as Picard and her look at each other.

					PICARD
			Let me tell you about your sister.
			The first time I met Tasha Yar,
			she was making her way through
			a Carnelian mine field to reach
			a wounded colonist.

	Ishara seems taken aback by the story.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Her ship had responded to their
			distress call, as had mine. When
			it was all over, I requested that
			Tasha be assigned to the
			Enterprise.
				(smiling)
			Her ship's captain owed me a
			favor.

	Picard pauses a moment.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			In the months that followed, Tasha
			never once failed to put the
			safety of the crew before her own.
				(beat)
			She died doing the same.

	Ishara stares at him, then looks away -- she doesn't
	know what to say.

	words.

40   INT. BRIDGE - SCIENCE STATION

	Ishara, now wearing more Federation-style than
	cadre-style clothing, is working with Data at a
	computer screen. He is sitting in front of it, she is
	standing next to him, guiding the process over his
	shoulder.

	Data indicates a curiously-shaped room next to a large
	chamber.

					DATA
			What is this structure?

					ISHARA
			A main fusion source -- there's
			one next to each of the Alliance
			headquarters. It powers all their
			defensive systems.

       STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/29/90 - ACT THREE       31.

43   CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Data touches a control, causing the map to display a
	series of small concentric circles over the spot,
	symbolically suggestive of a radiating power source.

44   RESUME

	Ishara again points to the map.

					ISHARA
			This chamber is accessed from the
			level below. Entry points are
			evenly spaced along this wall
			every twenty-five meters.

	Data again touches a control. Ishara looks up, taking
	in the sight of the bridge for a few moments. She's
	curious in spite of herself.

					ISHARA
			Data... Where was Tasha's post?

	Data seems a little surprised that she is asking about
	her sister, given her previous reluctance about the
	subject.

					DATA
			The Tactical Station -- where
			Lieutenant Worf is now.

	Worf has noticed Ishara's attention. He nods his
	acknowledgement. Ishara smiles in return. She seems
	to be starting to fit in. She turns back to Data,
	again curious in spite of herself.

					ISHARA
			Did Tasha have many friends here?

					DATA
			Yes. She was especially close
			to Commander Riker and Lieutenant
			Worf. And to myself.

					ISHARA
				(surprised)
			Are you able to have friends?

	Data looks up from the task in front of him.

					DATA
			Yes.

           STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/29/90 - ACT THREE           32.

44   CONTINUED:

					ISHARA
			But you don't have feelings, do
			you?

					DATA
			Not as such. However, perhaps
			even among humans, friendship is
			sometimes less an emotional
			response, and more a sense of
			familiarity.

					ISHARA
				(understanding)
			You can become used to someone.

					DATA
			Exactly. As I experience certain
			sensory input patterns, my mental
			pathways become accustomed to
			them. The inputs eventually are
			anticipated. And even "missed"
			when absent. When something once
			expected is no longer there.

	A quiet beat. This may be the first time in ten years
	Ishara has allowed herself to feel the loss.

					ISHARA
				(softly)
			Like my sister.

					DATA
			Yes. Like your sister.

	OFF the quiet look on Ishara's face.

45   INT. ENGINEERING

	Geordi is pointing to a chamber close to Alliance

	edge of the pyramid shape's base.

					GEORDI (O.S.)
				(continuing)
			And that's about two kilometers
			of solid granite above them.

47   RESUME

					RIKER
			So much for the transporter.

					GEORDI
			Not necessarily. We could use
			the ship's phasers to cut a shaft
			through the bedrock to this
			storage tunnel here.

47A  INSERT SCHEMATIC MAP (OPTICAL)

	Geordi's hand indicates a line starting from just
	outside the surface settlement and heading straight
	down through the ground to a chamber near the one he
	previously indicated.

					GEORDI (O.S.)
			With a clear path through the
			rock, we'd be able to transport
			down to the tunnel. That would
			put us close enough to get to the
			crewmen.

	Geordi's finger traces out the steps on the map.

47B  RESUME

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			It would take me a few hours to
			adjust the phasers for drilling.

	Riker indicates the map.

47B  CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			It's a maze around there...

					ISHARA
				(nodding)
			I spent a lot of time in that
			section before they took it over.
			There are blind tunnels and dead
			ends that don't even show up on
			this map.

					WORF
			We don't have much choice.

					ISHARA
			If it wasn't for my implant
			setting off all the alarms, I
			could guide you to your men.

	A beat.

					DATA
			We could remove the implant.

	Ishara shakes her head.

					ISHARA
			It has a micro-explosive inside
			that detonates on contact with
			air. When you join a cadre, you
			join for life.

	Data considers this a moment.

					DATA
			A small force field containing
			xenon or another inert gas could
			be placed over the incision site.
			The explosive could thereby be
			safely disarmed at the same time
			it is removed.

	For once with respect to strategy, Ishara seems to hold
	back, a hesitant look on her face. Riker picks up on
	it.

					RIKER
			It's more than just a tactical
			device to you, isn't it? It's
			part of your identity.

			Our parents were killed in some
			crossfire just after I was born.
			Some people took care of us for

			came home and they were gone.
			So Tasha took care of me. And
			when I got old enough, I joined
			the Coalition.

					DATA
			And Tasha did not?

					ISHARA
			My sister hated the cadres.
			Blamed them for our parents death.
			For everything. She refused to

				(continuing)
			But maybe I was wrong. Maybe
			she made the right choice.

	Ishara indicates the ship around them.

				(continuing)
			To work together for something

					DATA
			You find that appealing?

	She smiles at his innocent choice of words.

					ISHARA
			Very appealing. You're a perfect
			example. I hardly even know you
			Data, but already I completely
			trust you. I even consider you
			my friend.

					DATA
			Thank you. I would like to
			consider you my friend, Ishara.

	She grows quiet, filled with a deep sense of regret.

			If I had known about this place
			fifteen years ago, things might've

			Ishara is willing to have the

					PICARD
			Very good. You may inform Doctor
			Crusher.

					DATA
			She also expressed a desire to
			leave the colony. She hopes
			to apply to the Academy and
			eventually join Starfleet.

	Picard is completely taken aback. Troi is
	particularly disturbed.

					PICARD
			Does she understand the magnitude
			of these decisions?

					DATA
			She claims to, Captain.

					PICARD
			Her courage certainly speaks in
			her favor. But Ishara's personal
			history concerns me.

					DATA
			Did her sister not come from the
			very same environment, Sir?

51   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Tasha never joined one of these

			fundamental difference between

					DATA
			I do not know. But I do know that
			often for humans, decisions made
			in youth only hold true for youth.

	Impressed by Data's reasoning, Picard turns to Troi,
	who shakes her head, concerned.

					TROI
			I get a sense of ambiguity from
			her. Her loyalties are clearly
			divided, Captain, no matter what
			she may say.

					PICARD
			Are you suggesting we deny her
			an escape from this environment,
			Counselor?

					TROI
			No... I'm just not convinced she
			really wants to escape. It is
			the only way of life she's ever
			known.

					PICARD
			Ultimately, it is her decision
			to make, not ours...
				(beat)
			Certainly nothing would please
			me more than to see another

	She heads for an opening, hesitating.

					WORF
			Are you certain?

					ISHARA
			No, I'm not.

	She stops.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT FOUR           46A.

67   CONTINUED:

					ISHARA
			I was here. But it was a long
			time ago. I'm trying to remember...
			there have been changes...

	She looks around for a few more moments, makes a
	decision.

					ISHARA
			It's through here.

	She guides them towards one of the openings.

68   FOLLOW (OPTICAL)

	as Ishara leads the away team through an opening, past
	a couple of turns, to a place where they can see a
	secure-looking door, and one Alliance man standing
	guard nearby.

					ISHARA
			Your men are behind that door.

	Riker glances at the others, 'Let's do it... ' he moves
	stealthily into a forward position... and when the
	guard reacts to his movement, he fires -- the guard
	collapses, stunned. The away team rushes the door.
	Riker and Worf fire point-blank at the door when they
	get there, knocking it over.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FOUR           47.

68   CONTINUED:

	Riker, Data and Worf dive into the room. Ishara
	remains outside and on guard.

69   INT. CHAMBER (OPTICAL)

	A nondescript chamber. Riker, Data and Worf find Tan
	Tsu and the other crewman on their feet, hands bound
	together with some high-tech looking restraints.

					RIKER
			Hold out your hands.

	The crewmen comply as Riker fires a phaser blast at
	one of the restraints.

70   INT. TUNNEL (OPTICAL)

	Ishara glances back towards the chamber, then
	immediately and with intent, heads away from the room,
	clearly pursuing her own agenda.

	As she approaches a tunnel opening, a guard suddenly
	appears from within the tunnel, shocked to find her
	there. She blasts him with her phaser, winging him.

	Injured, the man falls to the ground, but manages with
	his last remaining strength to fire his phaser up at
	a small metal panel on the wall several meters away,
	before passing out. The panel answers with an
	ear-shattering alarm.

	Ishara, clearly distressed by the alarm, continues
	running the direction she was headed, disappearing into
	the tunnel.

71   INT. CHAMBER

	Riker frees the last crewman as all react to the sudden
	alarm.

					RIKER
			Let's get moving.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT FOUR            48.

72   INT. TUNNEL

	The away team and crewmen come flying out of the room
	-- Ishara is nowhere to be seen.

					RIKER
			Where is she?

	This is just what he didn't want to happen. Worf
	spots the wounded and unconscious guard across the
	tunnel.

					WORF
			Commander, look.

	Riker sees the guard.

					RIKER
			What the hell happened here?

					WORF
			She probably tried to draw their
			fire. It triggered the alarm.

					RIKER
				(nodding)
			Worf, get these men back to the
			Enterprise.
				(to Data)
			Data, you're with me. She can't
			be far.

	Worf hurries the crewmen out the way they came as Riker
	and Data split up and head towards the two tunnels
	opposite.

73   INT. TUNNEL OUTSIDE POWER GENERATOR (OPTICAL)

	One Alliance guard is standing outside what looks like
	a room-sized power generator. He appears edgy about
	the distant alarm. Ishara steps from around a
	projection, phaser raised. The guard has a second to
	register complete surprise at her presence before she
	blasts him away.

	She moves quickly to the generator, fires her phaser
	at a panel, which falls away, revealing the control
	devices underneath. She quickly steps forward and
	manipulates the controls. In response, the generator
	begins a slowly escalating hum.

					DATA (O.S.)
			Ishara.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT FOUR           48A.

74   INCLUDE DATA

	standing several yards away. He lowers his phaser,
	puzzled at her actions.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			What are you doing?

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT FOUR            49.

74   CONTINUED:

	She turns and faces him -- doesn't answer. He looks
	from her to the generator with its increasingly shrill
	sound.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			The fusion generator is
			overloading.
				(turns to her)
			You are attempting to disable the
			defense system. For what reason?
			We have rescued the crewmen.

					ISHARA
			I don't care about your crewmen.
			We have three thousand troops
			waiting at the perimeter. When
			the defenses go down, they'll come
			in. The Alliance will fall.

	A beat.

					DATA
			The Federation will be responsible
			for the resulting deaths. I
			cannot allow that.

					ISHARA
			You don't have a choice.

					DATA
			That is not true.

	He steps forward.

					ISHARA
			I don't want to kill you, Data.

	She looks like she genuinely doesn't. But she clicks
	the setting on her phaser, aiming straight at his
	chest.

					ISHARA
				(continuing)
			But I will.

									FADE OUT.

                        END OF ACT FOUR                         

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE           50.

                           ACT FIVE                             

	FADE IN:

75   INT. TUNNEL OUTSIDE POWER GENERATOR

	Ishara's phaser is trained on Data; Ishara is
	positioned between Data and the increasingly
	overloading generator.

					DATA
				(re: the generator)
			We will both be destroyed in the
			explosion.

					ISHARA
			The Coalition's been all I've
			had for fifteen years. They've
			given me a life. I don't mind
			dying for them.
				(a beat)
			But you won't have to if you get
			out of here right now.

	Data doesn't move.

					DATA
			Was this your intention from the
			beginning?

					ISHARA
			We never could have gotten this
			deep into Alliance territory
			without your help.

					DATA
			Our help was not deliberate. You
			deceived us.

	She seems defensive, as though feeling some guilt about
	what's happened.

					ISHARA
			What's the difference? You got
			what you came for. Why should
			you care about what we do?

	A beat as Data seems to come to a conclusion about
	something.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT FIVE            51.

75   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Your friendship with me was part
			of the deception, was it not?

	Her silence is her answer. She is not proud of it.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			You misled me at each step. And
			yet I was completely unaware.

					ISHARA
			That doesn't matter now! None
			of it does!
				(desperately)
			Get out of here, Data. Please.

	The generator suddenly increases its hum exponentially.

					ISHARA
				(continuing)
			Now.

					DATA
				(re: the generator)
			My duty requires me to intercede.

	And it all happens very quickly -- as he starts to step
	forward...

					ISHARA
			Stop...

	She clasps both hands on the phaser, tenses for firing
	--

					RIKER (O.S.)
			Ishara!

76   INCLUDE RIKER (OPTICAL)

	Stepping from behind a projection, phaser raised.
	Ishara immediately fires at Riker, missing as he ducks
	back behind the projection, giving Data the split
	second he needs to raise his phaser and fire at her.

	Ishara crumples, stunned by Data's phaser.

	Data rushes to the generator and starts working the
	controls under the exposed panel. Riker goes to
	Ishara, crouches down to see if she's alright.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE           52.

76   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			What was she doing?

	Data steps back from the generator as its humming whine
	begins to subside.

					DATA
			Disabling the detection system
			so her forces could attack.

	Riker picks up Ishara's phaser as she starts to regain
	consciousness. He stares at Data.

					RIKER
			Set to kill.

	OFF Data's neutral expression as he continues to
	process everything.

76A  EXT. ENTERPRISE

	In orbit around Turkana Four.

76B  INT. CORRIDOR

	A security man is standing guard outside crew's
	quarters. Worf approaches, stands in front of the door
	-- it slides open.

76C  ANGLE ON ISHARA

	sitting inside the room, like a prisoner awaiting her
	fate.

76D  INCLUDE WORF

	who seems barely able to tolerate her presence.

					WORF
			The Captain wants to see you on
			the bridge.

	Ishara stands, leaves the room and joins Worf, as the
	door slides shut behind her. Worf heads up the
	corridor, Ishara falling into step beside him. They
	continue for a few beats.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE          52A.

76D  CONTINUED:

					ISHARA
			What's going to happen to me?

					WORF
			That is Captain Picard's decision.
				(beat)
			If the captain were Klingon, you
			would be executed.

	Worf avoids looking at her, but Ishara glances up at
	him. Again, Ishara's voice is subdued -- she's not
	arguing, just trying to give an account of herself.

					ISHARA
			Sometimes a warrior must use
			deception in the service of her
			cause.
				(beat, quietly)
			If anyone on this ship should know
			that, it's you.

	They reach the turbolift. Worf stares at her.

					WORF
			Such a warrior must also be
			prepared to suffer the
			consequences.

	Worf coldly turns away. Hold for a beat on Ishara's
	face.

77   INT. BRIDGE

	The turbolift opens. Worf and Ishara step out and
	cross towards the center of the bridge, where Picard is
	facing the viewscreen. There is a vast coolness
	towards her from everyone -- in extreme contrast to
	the last time we saw them all together.

	All are facing the viewscreen.

					PICARD
			Your strategy failed.

78   INSERT VIEWSCREEN (INTERCUT AS NEEDED) (OPTICAL)

	A clearly-disappointed but not the least bit apologetic
	Hayne is facing them. Any sense of his disarming
	personality is gone.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE          52B.

78   CONTINUED:

					HAYNE
			It was a calculated risk. You
			gave us an opportunity we couldn't
			ignore.
				(a beat)
			Are you hurt, Ishara?

					ISHARA
			No.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/28/90 - ACT FIVE           53.

78   CONTINUED:

					HAYNE
				(to Picard)
			I want her returned immediately.

					RIKER
				(angered)
			You're not in a position to
			dictate to anybody. She attacked
			two Federation officers.

					HAYNE
			You have no jurisdiction here!

					RIKER
			Don't talk about legal rights.
			Your jurisdiction is based
			entirely on the threat of
			violence.

	A beat as Hayne realizes he isn't convincing anybody.

					HAYNE
			You have your crewmen back. Isn't
			that enough?

	Picard and Ishara are looking at each other -- a silent
	moment between them.

					PICARD
			Commander Data, escort Ishara to
			the transporter toom.

	Riker and other officers react with surprise. Picard
	turns back to the viewscreen.

					HAYNE
			Thank you, Captain.

	Picard doesn't acknowledge Hayne's response in any way
	whatsoever.

					PICARD
			Close the channel.

	Worf does so, as Data stands and goes to Ishara.

	In silence, Ishara turns with Data and they both head
	for the turbolift, entering it, and leaving the Bridge.

	Everyone turns to Picard.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE          53A.

78   CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
			You're far more charitable than
			I would have been, Captain.

	Picard pauses for a moment, glances around the room.
	There's a sadness in his voice.

					PICARD
			I understand your feelings, Number
			One. I share them. But perhaps
			the fault lies in ourselves. We
			were so eager to embrace her.
			Each of us, myself included,
			wanted to see something of Tasha
			in her sister. We saw more than
			what was there.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE           54.

79   INT. CORRIDOR

	Data and Ishara are walking, not looking at each other.

					ISHARA
			You haven't said one word to me.

					DATA
			What do you wish to talk about?

	She looks at him -- decides not to pursue it. They
	continue walking straight ahead.

80   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

	Data and Ishara are standing in front of the
	transporter units.

					ISHARA
			I did what I had to. I'm sorry
			if I hurt you in the process.

					DATA
				(reminding her)
			I am an android. It is not
			possible for me to be injured
			in that fashion.

81   ANGLE ON THE TRANSPORTER CHIEF

	As he finishes setting the controls.

					O'BRIEN
			Whenever you're ready.

82   RESUME DATA AND ISHARA (OPTICAL)

	Data and Ishara look at each other for a couple of
	silent moments.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/28/90 - ACT FIVE           55.

82   CONTINUED:

	Ishara steps onto a transporter pad and turns to face
	him, unable to keep the sadness out of her voice.

					ISHARA
			You know, I wasn't always lying
			to you, Data. The time we spent
			talking... it was the closest
			thing to friendship I've ever had.
				(a beat)
			If that means anything to you.

	No response.

					DATA
			Energize.

	The Transporter beam appears, Ishara DEMATERIALIZES
	into it and is gone.

83   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	travelling at impulse speed through space.

84   INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS

	Riker is working on a report.

					RIKER
			Come in.

	The door slides open and Data ENTERS. Riker is a
	little puzzled by the visit, but is pleasantly
	accommodating.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Data. Come in, come in.

					DATA
			Commander.

	Data steps forward, as Riker stands to greet him.

					RIKER
			What's on your mind?

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE           56.

84   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Recent events have left me
			puzzled, Sir.
				(off Riker's look)
			It has been days since Ishara
			left. And yet, my thoughts seem
			to dwell on her. Almost as if
			I were experiencing a feedback
			loop in my mnemonic network.

	Riker frowns at the subject... still trying to figure
	it out for himself.

					RIKER
			I know what you mean.

					DATA
			It is curious that I was so easily
			misled.

					RIKER
			Make that "we."

					DATA
			Yes sir.

	Riker considers him for a moment, seems to soften a
	bit. How does he explain it to Data when he doesn't
	quite understand it himself?

					RIKER
			Data, in every trust is the
			possibility of betrayal. I don't
			think you were prepared for that.

					DATA
			Were you prepared?

	Riker takes a beat, shakes his head, sighs.

					RIKER
			I'm not sure anybody ever is.

	Data considers this.

					DATA
			Then is it better not to trust?

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE          56A.

84   CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Without trust, there can be no
			friendship, no closeness. None
			of the emotional bonds that make
			us what we are.

					DATA
			And yet you put yourself at risk.

					RIKER
			Every single time. Love itself
			is a leap of faith.

	Data absorbs this.

            STAR TREK: "Legacy" - REV. 8/29/90 - ACT FIVE           57.

84   CONTINUED: (3)

					DATA
			So, a prerequisite for love is
			accepting the risk of betrayal.

	Riker is a little surprised by Data's conclusion.

					RIKER
			That's an interesting point of
			view, Data. Maybe you're right.

	A moment between them as Data glances away, still
	seeming to process these thoughts. Rikers's voice is
	quiet.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			The emotions we experience when
			someone we believe in turns away
			-- they're the most painful a
			person can feel.
				(a beat)
			We believed in her, Data...

	Data thinks about this.

					DATA
			Yes. Perhaps I am fortunate to
			be spared the emotional
			consequences.

					RIKER
				(gently)
			Perhaps...

	Data nods his thanks. FOLLOW Data as he turns and goes
	out the door.

85   OMITTED

86   INT. CORRIDOR

	The door closes behind him as Data takes few steps then
	pauses.

	He waits for a moment, then raises his closed hand. He
	opens it, revealing Ishara's jewel-like implant resting
	on his palm.
