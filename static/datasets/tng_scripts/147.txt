ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE	DATA is at Command, supernumeraries at Conn and OPS,	and WORF and ENSIGN BURKE confer at Tactical. All	heads turn as the forward turbolift opens and RIKER and	KOLRAMI, a slender weasel-like creature, ENTER and	cross to the Observation Lounge.3A   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE					PICARD				(rising, extending his				 hand)			Mister Kolrami -- Captain Jean-Luc			Picard. Welcome aboard.					KOLRAMI			Captain. I bring greetings from			those at Starfleet Command.    STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - REV. 4/21/89 - TEASER    2.3A   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Would you care to be shown to your			quarters?					KOLRAMI			I require little rest, Captain.			I would prefer to commence our			mission.	Picard and Riker share a glance -- "pushy little guy,	isn't he?"3B   INT. BRIDGE	Worf crosses to Data.					WORF			Despite their reputations, this			Zakdorn does not appear to be a			very formidable warrior.					DATA			In the game of military			brinksmanship, individual			physical prowess is less			important than the perception of			a species as a whole. For over			nine millennia potential foes have			regarded the Zakdorns as having			the greatest innately strategic			minds in the galaxy.					WORF			And no one is willing to test that			perception in combat.					DATA			Exactly.					WORF			Then the reputation means nothing.4    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	A magnificent view of the galaxy surrounds them as they	take their seats at one end of the table. Kolrami keys	the screen, and the DIAGRAM of a solar system appears.      STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - 4/18/89 - TEASER      3.4    CONTINUED:					KOLRAMI			The Braslota System. In orbit			around the second planet is the			eighty-year old Starcruiser,			Hathaway.				(nodding at Riker)			He is still your choice?					PICARD			Commander Riker will captain the			Hathaway.					KOLRAMI				(to Riker)			You will have forty-eight hours			to ready the vessel before the			Enterprise attacks.					RIKER			And we'll be experiencing actual			battle conditions?					KOLRAMI			Correct. Engineering will			disconnect the Enterprise's			weapons and link the system with			the modified laser-pulse beam.			All "hits" will be recorded			electronically. If the computer			registers "damage," it will react			accordingly -- shutting down the			affected areas for the appropriate			"repair" time. Additional			questions?	Riker and Picard share a look and shake their heads.					KOLRAMI			Captain Picard, I understand that			you initially resisted Starfleet's			request for this simulation.					PICARD			Yes.					KOLRAMI			May I know why?   STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - REV. 4/25/89 - TEASER   3A.4    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Starfleet is not a military			organization. Our purpose is			exploration.					KOLRAMI			Then why am I here?					PICARD			Because with the Borg threat,			I have decided that my officers			and I need to hone our tactical			skills.					(MORE)    STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - REV. 4/21/89 - TEASER    4.4    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD (Cont'd)			In a crisis situation, it is			prudent to have several options.					RIKER			I still prefer brains over brawn.				(to Kolrami)			I think it's a waste of			effort to test our combat skills			-- it's a minor province in the			make-up of a starship captain.					KOLRAMI			Your objection is noted. Let us			hope your distaste for the			exercise will not affect your			strategic abilities.	There is a moment as Riker absorbs the words and the	underlying contempt with which they were delivered.					RIKER			Mister Kolrami, when I agree to			do a thing. I do it.				(to Picard, lighter)			Care to surrender now, Captain?	Picard gives Riker a warm, small smile, then looks to	Kolrami as if to say, "see what a hell of a fellow he	is?" Off their various expressions --									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - 4/17/89 - ACT ONE      5.					ACT ONE	FADE IN:5    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Plying deep space at impulse.6    INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE	Picard, Riker, Data, PULASKI, and Kolrami are	present. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops. Burke at	Tactical.					PICARD			Well, Number One, you are allowed			a complement of forty. Select			whom you will. Save Data, who			will serve as my first officer			in your absence.	Before Riker can respond, Kolrami jumps in -- leaving	Pulaski slightly taken aback by his rudeness.					KOLRAMI				(to Picard)			I had envisioned you defining the			crew.					PICARD			On my ship, the leader of an away			team has total control of the			mission. If you want to judge			"leadership" -- why not start at			the beginning?	Kolrami sagaciously nods his assent, eyeing Picard as	if he, too, were under scrutiny.					KOLRAMI			Very well, Captain.	With a curt bow, he glides to the turbolift and	disappears.					PULASKI			My, what a charmer.					PICARD				(admonishingly)			Now, Doctor...   STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - REV. 4/20/89 - ACT ONE   6.6    CONTINUED:					PULASKI			Captain, he needs an attitude			adjustment.					DATA			The Zakdornian culture is replete			with self-assuredness and			confidence. It is seldom			undeserved. For example, Kolrami			is a third level grand master at			the game of Strategema.	Fine, but it doesn't make Pulaski feel any better.7    INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN ENGINEERING	Geordi and an ASSISTANT toil at aligning the warp	engine's dilithium chamber.					GEORDI				(giving directions)			Another millimeter... little			more... there! Excellent.					RIKER (O.S.)			Lieutenant.	Geordi straightens to find Riker looking on.					GEORDI			Commander.					RIKER			You've heard of the simulation			aboard the Hathaway?	As they talk, Goerdi takes Riker on a walking tour of	Engineering, checking "this" here, tweaking "that"	there.					GEORDI			Yes, sir, and the best of luck			to you. I've researched the old			Avidyne engines -- archaic by our			standards, very touchy.					RIKER			Anticipating the worst, do you			think it can be whipped into shape			in forty-eight hours?      STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - 4/18/89 - ACT ONE      7.7    CONTINUED:	Geordi stops walking and hefts a tool kit.					GEORDI				(smiling broadly)			I've taken the liberty of packing			a few necessities.	At this, Riker breaks into a grin, also.8    INT. ENTERPRISE - WORF'S QUARTERS	The room has been modified into a Klingon haven. The	lighting is subdued with a ruddy overtones. There is	a powerful scupture of a Klingon man, bare to the waist	taming a horse-like beast with a long snaking neck, and	two twisted horns springing from above each eye.	Worf is seated at his desk working on a model of an	antique Klingon sailing vessel.	A CHIME signals someone is at the door.	It startles Worf, and he breaks the masts on his ship.	A rumble of fury.					WORF			Enter!	The door opens and Riker steps in, looking around	curiously. This is his first time in here.					RIKER			Am I disturbing you?					WORF			Just finishing, Commander.	Worf opens a drawer, and sweeps the ship into it.	Shuts it firmly.					RIKER			"Interesting" quarters.					WORF			Thank you.      STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - 4/17/89 - ACT ONE      8.8    CONTINUED:					RIKER			You know of the simulation. What			do you think?					WORF			Waste of time.					RIKER			It's just designed to be an			exercise.					WORF			Useless. If there is nothing to			lose -- no sacrifice -- then there			is nothing to gain.					RIKER				(playing him)			You mean -- besides "pride."				(caught his attention)			Well, it's a good thing in this			case, because I probably don't			have a chance.					WORF				(alien concept)			There is always a chance.					RIKER			Slim. The Hathaway's most			sophisticated weapon-systems --			even in a computer mock-up --			can't hope to defeat the			Enterprise.					WORF			Still...					RIKER			Worf... when you're out-gunned,			out-manned, and out-equipped --			what else do you have left?					WORF				(long beat)			Guile.					RIKER			Join me.      STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - 4/17/89 - ACT ONE      9.8    CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			The honor is to serve.	Riker allows himself another smile -- this crew is	pulling together nicely.9    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Zooming along at impulse.10   INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE	Riker ENTERS to find Picard in the Command Chair, Data	to his right, Pulaski on his left, Wesley at Conn,	Burke at Tactical, and Kolrami examining Science One.					PICARD			Begin long-range scanning of all			sectors within three light years			of Braslota.				(seeing Riker)			How is your crew shaping up?					RIKER			It's complete, but I would like			to request an addition.					PICARD				(playing along)			Anyone in mind?					RIKER			With your permission, I would like			Acting Ensign Crusher aboard for			educational observation.	Picard nods. Riker, in turn, gives Wesley a "c'mon"	head move. Wesley's enthusiasm can hardly be muted as	he leaps from the Conn -- to be quickly replaced by	a CREWPERSON.					RIKER				(as if an afterthought)			Oh... since we have some time			before reaching Braslota --				(deferentially to				 Kolrami)			I was hoping that you would agree			to play me in a game of Strategema.   STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - REV. 4/24/89 - ACT ONE   10.10   CONTINUED:					KOLRAMI			Although I am intrigued by the			audacity of your request, I can't			fathom why you wish the encounter.					RIKER			I enjoy a challenge.					KOLRAMI			Very well, an opponent of "limited			dimensions" can often be quite			diverting.					RIKER			Thank you.11   INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - TRACKING	Geordi and Riker on their way to Ten-Forward.					GEORDI			So you're going to beat him?					RIKER			Nope.					GEORDI			Oh, then it's going to be a close			one.					RIKER			No.					GEORDI			But you have got a chance?					RIKER			Nah.					GEORDI				(a little sarcastic)			Are you planning to show up?					RIKER			Sure, Kolrami is the best at			Strategema. To even get to play			him is a privilege.   STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - REV. 4/25/89 - ACT ONE   11.11   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Other than you being privileged,			is there anything else I can			look forward to?					RIKER			Nope.					GEORDI			This is going to be exciting.12   INT. ENTERPRISE - TEN-FORWARD	Riker and Kolrami are seated at opposite ends of a	large table. Worf helps Riker prepare for the game	while Troi performs the same function for the Zakdorn.13   ANGLE - GEORDI, DATA AND PULASKI					PULASKI			Against an opponent of approximate			skill -- Strategema can last well			over one thousand moves.					GEORDI			I wouldn't bet on us being here			that long.13A  ANGLE ON WORF AND RIKER					WORF				(confiding to Riker)			I have wagered heavily in the			ship's pool that you will take			him past the sixth plateau.   STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - REV. 4/21/89 - ACT ONE   12.13A  CONTINUED:					RIKER			What if I don't?					WORF			I will be... irritated.	During the above, each contestant inserts his	fingertips into METALLIC RECEPTACLES (think overly-long	thimbles).14   DATA, GEORDI AND PULASKI - TROI JOINS THEM					DATA			Forever curious, this urge to			"compete."					PULASKI			It's a human response, that inborn			craving to gauge your capabilities			through conflict.					DATA			Doctor, there are other ways to			challenge oneself.					PULASKI			Perhaps... but they all lack a			certain -- thrill!					TROI			Data, sometimes humans find it			helpful to have an outsider set			the standard by which they're			judged.					DATA				(catching on)			To avoid deceiving oneself.					PULASKI			Maybe you should challenge			Kolrami to Strategema.					DATA				(surprised)			Why?   STAR TREK: "Peak Performance" - REV. 4/21/89 - ACT ONE   13.14   CONTINUED:					PULASKI			Because when someone is that smug,			you occasionally have to deflate			them just a little.					GEORDI			Yeah, Data, I'd like to see your			neural-flecks tear him down a peg.					DATA			To what end?	Reactions from the humans. Once again the toaster	isn't "getting" it.15   WORF (OPTICAL)	presiding over the contest.					WORF			Computer -- actuation positions			for Strategema.	A base containing the digital counter sits on the	table.					WORF			Ready?	Riker nods. Kolrami nods.					WORF				(continuing)			Begin!	Wow! "Thimble"-encased fingers twitch and goggled-eyes	shift. Correspondingly, the holographic cone springs	to incredible life. Breathtaking! Impossible to	follow or explain, Strategema nonetheless presents an	awesome spectacle even to those who have seen it	before.	Wondrous!

Suddenly, startlingly abrupt,	the images freeze! It's as if Strategema died. No one	moves, no one breathes, no one reacts.
