TRANSPORTER ROOM	RIKER and WORF are standing near the platform. GEORDI	and RO ENTER, carrying large tool kits. Everyone has	tricorders and phasers. CHIEF BROSSMER, a woman in	her forties, is standing behind the console.       STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - TEASER       3.3    CONTINUED:					RIKER				(to com)			Riker here.					PICARD			Number One... transport to the			Romulan vessel as soon as we're			in range.					RIKER			Aye, sir.				(to others)			No weapons. We don't want them			to think they're under attack.	They turn over their phasers to Brossmer.

I			didn't quite catch that.					RO				(stiffly)			Nothing, sir.	They all move up to the transporter pad.       STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - TEASER       4.4    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship drops out of warp.5    NEW ANGLE - ENTERPRISE & ROMULAN SHIP (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise moves alongside a ROMULAN SCIENCE SHIP	which is about half the size of the Enterprise.                                             CUT TO:6    INT. ROMULAN ENGINE ROOM (OPTICAL)	The engine room is a wreck. There are blown out	consoles, burnt panels, flames, smoke, DEAD BODIES,	etc. The room is smaller than engineering on the	Enterprise and should reflect very different ideas	about engineering design and philosophy than those we	are familiar with. Their engine core is a spherical	device contained within a small chamber which has a	single open hatch.	As crewpeople douse the flames, a male Romulan officer	-- MIROK -- is frantically trying to work a	recalcitrant console along with a woman -- VAREL.	The away team MATERIALIZES in the middle of the room.	The Romulans look at them with astonishment.					RIKER			We're from the Federation Starship			Enterprise. We received your			distress call.	Mirok is somewhat dazed. Geordi and Ro move quickly to	the engine consoles and open their carrying cases while	Worf keeps a wary eye on the Romulans.					MIROK			The Enterprise... ?	Mirok is still trying to get his bearings in this	unexpected situation. But there isn't time to play	around, and Riker takes charge of the situation.	Riker's confident and naturally commanding presence	prompt Mirok to listen to him.					RIKER			That's right. Your message said			you'd suffered a failure in your			engine core.					MIROK			Yes.       STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - TEASER       5.6    CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(to Riker)			Commander?7    NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Riker moves to him and the Romulans follow. Geordi and	Ro have removed a piece of equipment about the size of	a footlocker from the console. It looks fused and	burnt.					GEORDI				(re: equipment)			It's a pretty strange set-up, but			I think the graviton field			generator has completely			depolarized. We can't fix it,			it has to be replaced.					RIKER				(to Romulans)			Where are your replicators?					VAREL			They are off-line.	Riker looks around quickly.					RIKER			Who's in charge here?	The Romulans exchange glances, then Mirok steps forward	hesitantly.					MIROK			The captain is dead. I'm... the			science officer. Mirok.					RIKER				(urgent)			We'd like to take the generator			back to the Enterprise for			replication.					MIROK				(brief hesitation)			All right.       STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - TEASER       6.7    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Geordi, you and Ro.	They nod and then wrestle the graviton generator away	from the console. Riker and Mirok move to a different	console.					GEORDI				(hits combadge)			La Forge to Brossmer. Two people,			one piece of equipment to beam			aboard.					BROSSMER'S COM VOICE			Aye, sir.	Ro, Geordi, and the generator begin to DEMATERIALIZE...	then something goes wrong... their images FUZZ and	SPARK strangely.8    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Brossmer is struggling to bring them aboard... STRANGE	SHAPES and EFFECTS dance on the transporter pad.	It's unlike any transporter effect we've seen before.					BROSSMER				(frustrated)			What the hell...				(urgent, to com)			Engineering, I need more power			to the primary energizing coil.	More EFFECTS on the stage. Brossmer keeps working,	but she can't get anywhere.					BROSSMER			Brossmer to Commander Riker. I'm			losing them -- I have to abort.			They should be returning to your			coordinates.	The EFFECTS STOP on the stage.								INTERCUT:9    INT. ROMULAN ENGINE ROOM	Riker and Worf wait for them to reappear... nothing.	After a long beat...       STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - TEASER       7.9    CONTINUED:					RIKER				(urgent, to com)			Chief, they're not here. Do you			have them?					BROSSMER			No, sir.	Beat.					RIKER			Where are they?	Long beat as Brossmer works. Finally...					BROSSMER				(in shock)			I can't locate their patterns.				(beat)			We've lost them, sir. They're			gone.	Off Riker's shocked expression.                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - REV. 3/16/92 - ACT ONE    8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            10   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Only a few minutes have passed since the end of the	Teaser. Picard and Troi are reacting to the loss of Ro	& Geordi.					BROSSMER'S COM VOICE			I'm sorry, Captain. But there's			just nothing left to retrieve.					PICARD			Begin a level one diagnostic.			All transporter systems to remain			off-line until further notice.				(to Data)			Could they have materialized			somewhere else?					DATA				(off console)			Negative, Captain. Sensors are			unable to find them within			transporter range.					PICARD				(to Troi)			Counselor?	Troi waits a beat and silently "listens"... but her	expression is grim. She shakes her head. That seems	to seal the fate of their friends. But there is no	time to mourn.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Riker to Enterprise.					PICARD			Go ahead, Number One.                                       INTERCUT:    STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - REV. 3/16/92 - ACT ONE    9.11   INT. ROMULAN ENGINE ROOM	Riker is standing off by himself in the engine room.	He has to put aside his feelings for now to deal with	the emergency.					RIKER			Captain, we're still looking at			a core breach unless we can			fashion a new graviton generator.			I need...				(beat, then bluntly)			I need replacement personnel, sir.11A  RESUME BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS	Picard thinks for a beat.					PICARD			Mister Data, you may continue your			diagnostic of the transporter			system later. Take a shuttlecraft			and two more engineers to the			Romulan ship.					DATA				(on the move)			Aye, sir.	Data EXITS.					PICARD				(to McDowell)			Mister McDowell, alert the main			shuttlebay to have all available			ships and pilots standing by in			case we need them.					MCDOWELL			Aye, sir.					PICARD				(to Conn Officer)			Lay in a course to take us away			from the Romulan ship at Warp One			in case it explodes.	The Conn Officer nods and works the console. Orders	given, Picard moves back to the command area and sits	down. Hold a beat on his expression as he takes a beat	to reflect on his lost crewmen.                                             CUT TO:      STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE      10.12   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE & ROMULAN SHIP (OPTICAL)	The two ships as seen before.13   INT. ROMULAN ENGINE ROOM	Riker moves to where Mirok and Varel are working on a	console. The atmosphere is tense and urgent.					MIROK				(worried, off console)			Pressure in the containment			chamber has increased fifteen			melakols in the last two minutes.					RIKER				(to Mirok)			What can we do to stop the			overload?					MIROK				(frustrated)			Most of the conduits were damaged			in the explosion. I can't even			access the central computer.14   NEW ANGLE	As Worf and an N.D. Romulan ENTER through a doorway.	They both look dirty and bedraggled.					WORF				(to Riker)			Emergency bulkheads have sealed			this section from the rest of the			ship. There is no way to gain			access to the bridge or other			control centers.					RIKER			Survivors?      STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE      11.14   CONTINUED:					WORF			Readings indicate at least			seventy-three Romulans are still			alive.					VAREL				(shocked)			Seventy-three...	Suddenly there is an ALARM from the console. Mirok and	Varel quickly examine the readings and are horrified	at the result.					MIROK			The pressure has jumped two			hundred melakols!					VAREL			I've lost control of the			containment chamber!					MIROK				(stunned)			It's going to implode...	Riker takes charge of the situation. The Romulans	accept his leadership without question at this point.					RIKER			We'll have to dump the entire			engine core. Do you have an			auto-eject system?					MIROK			Yes, but it's not functioning.			I'll have to do it manually.	Mirok runs over to a bulkhead near the chamber and	rips open a panel. He begins frantically working	controls within the panel.					RIKER			Worf, you two seal the chamber.      STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE      12.14   CONTINUED: (2)	Worf and the N.D. run inside the chamber and begin	pulling out optical conduit and power leads connecting	the sphere-shaped chamber to the walls.					VAREL				(off console)			Implosion will occur in one minute			five seconds...	As the following dialog takes place, Worf and the N.D.	finish disconnecting the conduits and run out of the	chamber. They start to close the door leading to the	chamber, but there is a large beam blocking the way.	They struggle to move it, but it's too heavy.					RIKER				(hits combadge)			Riker to Enterprise. We're			preparing to jettison the engine			core. We'll need you to extend			shields once it clears the hull.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Understood, Number One. We'll			stand by for your signal.					WORF			Commander!	Riker turns and sees the difficulty they're having with	the beam and the door. He and Varel rush over and help	them move the beam...					RIKER				(as he pulls on beam,				 to Varel)			Time?					VAREL			Thirty seconds...	The beam finally crashes to the deck. They try to pull	the doors shut... they get halfway, then jam. Mirok	sits up.					MIROK			Ready!					RIKER				(straining against door)			Stay there! Eject the chamber			on my order!      STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE      13.14   CONTINUED: (3)	But it's futile... they can't move it at all.

Riker and Worf step aside as Data	moves quickly to the jammed doors. With a burst of	android strength, he PULLS the doors together and seals	the chamber.					RIKER				(to Mirok)			Now!	Mirok works a control and the ship SHAKES ONCE as the	chamber is ejected. The lights go OUT.					RIKER				(hits combadge)			Enterprise, extend shields!                                             CUT TO:16   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE & ROMULAN SHIP (OPTICAL)	The two ships are side by side. Suddenly, there is a	flash of LIGHT from the bottom of the Romulan ship and	an EXPLOSION a short distance away from the ship. But	the blast from the explosion is kept away from the two	ships by the shields of the Enterprise, which now	surround both vessels. (It is the explosion which	makes the shields visible.)17   INT. ROMULAN ENGINE ROOM	As before. The room SHAKES slightly then stops.	Everyone is standing still in the gloomy darkness.	After a beat, Riker turns to Mirok and a slow smile	spreads across his face.					RIKER				(to Mirok)			Well... we're still here.      STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE      14.17   CONTINUED:					MIROK				(smiles)			Yes.	It's a unique moment... Starfleet and Romulan	crewmembers standing side by side, celebrating a joint	victory.                                             CUT TO:18   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship hangs in space.19   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard is listening to Riker's report.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			We'll have a complete power survey			done within the hour... we'll			probably have to supply them with			energy for life support... and			they're definitely going to need			a new engine core to get home			again.					PICARD				(to com)			Understood, Commander.

CORRIDOR	Picard ENTERS from a turbolift. He walks along the	corridor, lost in thought... his expression is grim and	deeply disturbed. Follow him for a moment... then as	he rounds a corner CAMERA DROPS OFF ON Ensign Ro, who	is sitting near a corridor intersection.      STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE      15.20   CONTINUED:	Ro is just waking up... she's groggy and disoriented.	She puts a hand to her head and rubs her eyes for a	moment, trying to clear the cobwebs. N.D. CREWMEN pass	her, without seeing her. (NOTE: From this point on,	no one can see Ro. She is invisible to everyone	aboard the ship.)	Ro stands up and looks around... finally decides that	something has gone wrong, although she's not sure	exactly what. She hits her communicator.					RO				(to com)			Ensign Ro to bridge.				(beat)			This is Ensign Ro, reporting in...			I'm in section twenty-three baker,			near sickbay.	Still nothing. She frowns at the recalcitrant	communicator... then she suddenly gets dizzy... she	shakes her head and the dizziness goes away.					RO				(to herself)			Sickbay...	Ro walks along the empty corridor toward sickbay.21   NEW ANGLE	As Ro reaches sickbay. When she gets to the door, she	pulls up short as it refuses to open. Before she can	reach out to touch the door in puzzlement, it suddenly	OPENS and a N.D. CREWPERSON ENTERS the corridor from	sickbay. He barrels past her without a glance. (To	Ro, he seems rude, but again, the Crewman never sees	her.) Ro gives him an irritated look and goes through	the still open door before it closes behind her.22   INT. SICKBAY - CONTINUOUS	Ro ENTERS. N.D. NURSES & PATIENTS go about their	business without noticing Ro standing near the doorway.	She tries to get their attention.					RO			I need some help.    STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - REV. 3/17/92 - ACT ONE    16.22   CONTINUED:	No response.					RO				(louder)			Excuse me?	Still nothing. What's going on here? Ro moves toward	Beverly's office to see if she can get someone to	listen to her over there.23   INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS	Picard and BEVERLY are in the middle of an argument in	the office. Ro pauses in the doorway, naturally	reluctant to interrupt the conversation.					BEVERLY			The transporter could've beamed			them somewhere else... the Romulan			ship, another deck of the			Enterprise...					PICARD				(gently)			We've already checked those			possibilities.				(beat)			The preliminary findings indicate			there was a radiation surge from			the Romulan engine core which			disrupted the signal. They never			rematerialized.					BEVERLY			We should check again, there might			be something we overlooked and---					PICARD				(gentle, but firm)			We've done all we can, Beverly.	Beverly takes a beat... then reluctantly agrees.      STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE      17.23   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			You're right. I just... hate			making out death certificates.				(beat)			Did Ensign Ro have any family?	Ro is shocked -- they think she's dead!					RO			Captain, I'm right here.					PICARD				(to Beverly)			None that I know of, but I'll			check with the Bajoran Liaison			Office.					RO				(yells)			I'm not dead!					BEVERLY				(resigned)			I'll have the official reports			ready within the hour.	Beverly sits at the desk... the weariness of losing too	many shipmates is clear on her face.24   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Picard turns to leave Beverly alone.

Finally	the shapes resolve themselves and Ro and Geordi APPEAR.	They stagger to their feet as a shocked hush fills the	room.        STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - REV. 3/20/92 - ACT FIVE       64.79   CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(urgent, to Data)			Data -- Can you see me?	Data is probably the only one in the room capable of	answering that question at the moment.					DATA				(simply)			Of course.					GEORDI				(hits badge)			La Forge to engineering.

It is heaped with food. Geordi is still eating	ravenously, but Ro is not showing much interest in the	food.					GEORDI			Could you pass the rolls?	Ro passes a plate, but is clearly preoccupied.					RO			You've been eating for an hour...					GEORDI			We didn't have anything to eat			for almost two days. I'm starved.	Ro nods and smiles wanly.        STAR TREK: "The Next Phase" - REV. 3/20/92 - ACT FIVE       66.81   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			What's wrong?					RO			Nothing...	She begins drawing little circles on the table with	a bread stick.					RO			I was raised with Bajoran			beliefs... and I even followed			some of the practices, but...			I never really believed in life			after death. Then suddenly I was			dead and there was another life.			It made me feel like I'd been...			pretty arrogant to discount all			I'd been taught. Now... I don't			know what to believe...	Geordi puts down his fork and considers her for a	moment.					GEORDI			Maybe we should develop our own			interphase device...				(off her look)			... if it can teach Ro Laren			humility, it can do anything.	She looks at him... there's a beat... and then they	both share a laugh.					RO			You know... I think I am hungry			after all.	He grins and passes her a plate of food and they dig	in.81A  EXT.
