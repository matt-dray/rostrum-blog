We'll have Starbase			Montgomery give us an independent			reading.     STAR TREK: "... Icarus...

My ego isn't			at stake here.					DATA			Perhaps we could reprogram the			system to correct the readout			variables --					PICARD			That's certainly an option, but			since we're stopping at Starbase			Montgomery anyway, we'll let them			do the analysis.					RIKER			Sir? I don't recall Starbase			Montgomery on our mission			itinerary --					PICARD			I think we could all use a			twelve-hour layover. Besides,			I've just received some personnel			transfer directives. Priority			matters --					RIKER			Boarding or disembarking?     STAR TREK: "... Icarus...

I suspect			that I was somewhat miserly in			offering congratulations then,			so let me make up for it now.			Congratulations. The captain of			the Starship Ares is retiring.			You've been selected as his			replacement.					RIKER			The Ares... she is in Vega-Omicron			sector.     STAR TREK: "... Icarus...

Not for your military			proficiency, but for your skill			as an explorer and diplomat.					RIKER			Vega-Omicron. It'll take months			at high warp just to get there.					PICARD			With no guarantee of finding			anything once you arrive. Well,			you have twelve hours to think			it over. And maybe it's premature,			but congratulations, "Captain."									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "... Icarus...

STARBASE MONTGOMERY - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	moves into position above a well-established planetary	outpost while:4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - PICARD	sits in his Command Chair, Data at Ops, WORF at	Tactical, WESLEY at Conn, as Riker ENTERS.					PICARD			Establish synchronous orbit.					WESLEY			Aye, sir.	Picard turns to Riker as he approaches:					PICARD			Starbase Montgomery is sending			a civilian advisor aboard to brief			you on the Ares's mission.					RIKER			A personal briefing?					PICARD			Yes. Strategic attache with			specialized knowledge of the			frontier regions. I think you'll			find the briefing... very			interesting.					RIKER			I hope it's complete. Much of			my decision will be based on it.					HERBERT'S COM VOICE			Commander Riker to the Transporter			Room.	Riker heads for the turbolift.     STAR TREK: "... Icarus...

He's on his way now...	Herbert works his magic on the console and now he and	Riker look up at:6    THE TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)	where the FORM OF A MAN MATERIALIZES, and as it starts	to be more clearly defined:7    RIKER	realizes.					RIKER			Dad... ?8    KYLE RIKER	steps down from the Transporter Pad, walks right up to	Riker, studies him just as Riker studies his father.	Kyle's a jut-jawed, extremely fit, silver-haired	civilian in his fifties. As they eyeball each other:     STAR TREK: "... Icarus... " - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE     7.9    RIKER	assumes Academy courtesy: Polite, detached,	unemotional.					RIKER			You're the civilian advisor? The			strategic attache?					KYLE			I asked Captain Picard to keep			it quiet. I didn't want you to			get nervous... excited.					RIKER			It's been fifteen years.			Excitement is hardly the			appropriate emotion.	Kyle purses his lips, considers that, then counters:					KYLE			You've done well. First officer			on the Enterprise is quite a			feather in your cap.					RIKER			I've worked hard.					KYLE			Of course. I'm proud of you,			Will --					RIKER			If you'll excuse me, I've got my			duties to attend to. After you've			settled in, we'll complete the			briefing.				(then, to Herbert)			Have security send an escort for			this gentleman.	With that, Riker about-faces and EXITS, leaving Kyle to	share an awkward moment with Ensign Herbert as we:									GO TO:10   INT. CORRIDOR - WESLEY	turns a corner, catches up with Worf and walks beside	him as:     STAR TREK: "... Icarus... " - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE     8.10   CONTINUED:					WESLEY			Did you hear about Commander			Riker's promotion?	Worf barely acknowledges Wesley, obviously upset by	something.					WORF			Yes.					WESLEY			He didn't even know his father			was coming. It was a complete			surprise --	Worf stops in mid-stride, turning toward Wesley grimly.					WORF			So?					WESLEY			Well, can you imagine if it was			your father?					WORF			I never knew my father.					WESLEY			And I didn't have one long			enough --					WORF			It is a waste of time to think			about such things.					WESLEY			I'm not thinking about it, really,			but everybody needs somebody,			don't you think -- ?	Worf glares at Wesley, fairly barking:					WORF			Enough!	Worf drills Wesley with his intensity, then marches	off, leaving Wesley a bit shaken as we:									GO TO:     STAR TREK: "... Icarus... " - REV. 2/8/89 - ACT ONE     9.11   INT. MAIN ENGINE ROOM - GEORDI	weaves through a TRIO OF STARBASE MONTGOMERY TECHS and	a TRIO OF ENTERPRISE TECHS as they run their analysis.					GEORDI			Starbase Montgomery really didn't			have to send me all this help,			because we've already checked the			entire dilithium spectrum for			anomalous frequencies, so don't			waste your time on that --	Just then, Wesley ENTERS, ashen faced.					GEORDI				(continuing)			Wes... you okay?					WESLEY			I was just talking to Worf.				(then)			He's somewhat eccentric at times.					GEORDI			That's one word for it.					WESLEY			But he was so upset -- I must've			said something wrong.					GEORDI			Maybe Worf's not too thrilled			with the idea of losing Commander			Riker to a new assignment. I'm			sure not --					WESLEY			Neither am I... But I think			it's something else with Worf...			something's really bothering			him.	Geordi considers that, exchanging a look of concern	with Wesley now as we:									GO TO:12   INT. TEN-FORWARD - PULASKI	sits at the bar with a couple of n.d. MEDICAL CREW	STAFF, enjoying some down time.	PULL BACK to reveal:    STAR TREK: "... Icarus... " - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE    10.13   RIKER	at a corner table with Chief O'Brien, with a cup of	steaming tea. He sips the tea.					O'BRIEN			Female?	Riker does not reply.					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			Career?					RIKER			Family.					O'BRIEN			That is trouble. You choose your			friends... you choose your			enemies... But family... that's			in the stars.					RIKER			So I've heard.	As he sips:14   KYLE RIKER	ENTERS and immediately spots some people he knows.					KYLE			Boliska! What in the name of			the Federation are you doing			here -- ?	He goes over and shakes hands with BOLISKA who is with	a couple of other old n.d. friends, then spots:    STAR TREK: "... Icarus... " - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT ONE    11.15   PULASKI	who visibly reacts at the sight of Kyle. She slowly	rises, turning to her tablemates:					PULASKI			Excuse me...	She crosses the room; he does the same, and as they	come within whispering range:					PULASKI				(continuing)			This is more than a surprise...			it's total shock.					KYLE			You mean you didn't bake me a			cake?					PULASKI			You're actually here.					KYLE			That makes two of us.				(then, re an empty				 table)			How about a drink?					PULASKI			How about a kiss?	He smiles at that, kisses her lightly and then they	exchange a warmly mutual embrace while:16   RIKER	turns to O'Brien with:					RIKER			They know each other...					O'BRIEN			I know her too, but we don't do			that.	And as they both react to Kyle's familiarity with	Pulaski, we:									GO TO:    STAR TREK: "... Icarus... " - REV. 2/8/89 - ACT ONE    12.17   INT. MAIN ENGINE ROOM - GEORDI, DATA, AND WESLEY	move around the dilithium chamber, watching the	starbase crew go about their analysis while:					DATA			And it has nothing to do with			Commander Riker's new assignment?					WESLEY			No. His reaction to that was just			the opposite of mine: Completely			unaffected.					GEORDI			You see? With all that's going			on, you might be overreacting.					WESLEY			Really? You try talking to Worf.			I'm telling you, he's not...			normal... for Worf.					DATA			There is, of course, a genetic			predisposition toward hostility			among all Klingons, although Worf			does seem unusually out of sorts.					GEORDI			He's never been much on charm --					WESLEY			Well, whatever troubles him, we			should try to help. He is our			friend.					GEORDI			And I'd like to keep him			friendly.				(then)			Any suggestions?					DATA			Empirical study. Monitor the			subject.					WESLEY			Right. We'll watch for any			signs of unusual behavior --					GEORDI			That shouldn't be difficult --    STAR TREK: "... Icarus...

Where do we start?					GEORDI				(re himself and Data)			We... will assist you as needed.				(then)			You found the problem...					DATA			And you must solve it.	With that, Data and Geordi walk off, leaving Wesley	wondering what he's gotten himself into now, as we:									GO TO:18   INT. TEN-FORWARD - RIKER	downs the last of his tea, looks across the room at:19   PULASKI AND KYLE	who sit together at the bar, obviously enjoying each	other's company.					KYLE			... and after working out the			Fuurinkazan battle strategies			at the Tokyo Base, I was asked			to go to work for Starfleet as			a tactical advisor.					PULASKI			I'm surprised you stayed away from			the action as long as you did --	Just then, Riker steps up, having overheard that last	line.					PULASKI			Hi, Will -- join us? Your father			and I were just catching up --    STAR TREK: "... Icarus...

Worf collapses at the end of the	trough, rolls over, and... smiles at them all,	whispering:					WORF				(continuing)			Thank you, my friends. Thank			you... You have my respect.

GYMNASIUM - RIKER AND KYLE (OPTICAL)	approach an exotic combat arena, wearing anbo-jyutsu	gear which consists of snug face shield and helmet,	abdomen shield, and slender pads on all other vital	areas. They carry anbo-jyutsu staffs, tapered on one	end, padded on the other, with a reostat twist-shaft	in the center grip. The arena itself is a ring	fourteen feet in diameter.					KYLE			Anbo-jyutsu. The ultimate			evolution of the martial arts.					RIKER			I remember my early lessons.					KYLE			You could never get used to the			sightless factor... or to losing.					RIKER			True.

Kyle does the	same, as they shout in unison:			RIKER					KYLE		Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu!	Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu!	And the battle begins as each man stalks the other with	the tapered end of his staff. The closer the staff's	tip comes to the opponent, the louder a series of BEEPS	which are emitted. Kyle finds Riker's leg, swiftly	swings his staff at Riker, but as he does, of course,	the BEEPS cease as the tapered end moves away from the	target, allowing Riker to dodge the blow.         STAR TREK: "... Icarus... " - REV. 2/6/89 - ACT FIVE        49.49   CONTINUED:	(Silence from the opponent's staff means that he's	taking a swing and cues a defensive move.) As Kyle	recovers from the missed blow, Riker suddenly reverses	direction, swings, and knocks Kyle's feet out from	under him and, as he tumbles to the mat outside the	ring, the POINT BUZZER SOUNDS.	Both men flip up their blind-shields as Kyle regains	his feet and re-enters the ring.					KYLE			You have been practicing.					RIKER			And remembering.				(then)			You never should've let her die.	Riker flips his blind-shield down, quickly bowing,	shouting:					RIKER			Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu.	Kyle reacts, pleased; then:					KYLE			Good. Get it all out!	Now Kyle flips his blind-shield down again, quickly	bowing, shouting:					KYLE			Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu.	They stalk one another again. Riker makes a brilliant	move, but somehow Kyle artfully avoids his son's blow.	Riker reacts, frustrated and amazed as he shouts:					RIKER			Matta!	The action stops. They each flip up their	blind-shields, Riker furrowing his brow curiously.					RIKER			I had you.					KYLE			Will, listen.

Then	they bow and face off once again, as Riker calls upon	all his stamina to avoid his father's clever blows,	summoning an inner reserve of will and determination as	he deftly parries Kyle's offensive move, suddenly	freezing in his tracks with:					RIKER			Matta!         STAR TREK: "...
