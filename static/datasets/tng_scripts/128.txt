SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	It is moving gracefully at full impulse.2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	JEAN-LUC PICARD is in the command chair. TROI is	beside him. DATA is at Ops; WESLEY at Conn. Neither	Worf nor Riker is on the bridge. Picard appears to	be on edge.					TROI			You're worried.					PICARD			With reason.					TROI			About Worf, or about Commander			Riker?					PICARD			Both.				(pauses)			I think perhaps it is best to			be ignorant of certain elements			of the Klingon psyche.	Off Troi's reaction.3    INT. HOLODECK - DEMOLISHED AREA	Everywhere there is evidence of a desperate battle,	fought on a very primitive level by creatures of	consummate rage.4    CLOSE ON WORF	His eyes blaze with controlled fury as he moves	carefully around a semi-demolished wall and peers	inside the battle-damaged room. He coils as he hears	the eerie sound of a low moan, then cautiously steps	forward.      STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - TEASER      2.5    RIKER	is a few paces behind. He is very tense as he moves	closer to the large Klingon warrior. Riker touches	the tear in his uniform and massages the bruise on his	shoulder.6    ANOTHER ANGLE - RIKER AND WORF	WORF touches RIKER's shoulder, signals him to move to	the right. Riker moves off. Worf pauses a beat, then	slips away to the left.7    WIDER ANGLE	carrying them to the edge of the rubble-cluttered room.	Careful not to touch anything, Worf is moving like a	panther. He freezes as the CLICKING SOUND OF METAL ON	METAL is barely heard. He waves his arm to Riker,	motioning him back, then slowly he also backs away	painstakingly, trying to fit his toes back into his	exact footsteps. We HOLD on these moves a beat and	then suddenly:8    RIKER	spins and looks upward, calls over to Worf.					RIKER			Above, look out!9    NEW ANGLE	A man-sized boulder drops down from overhead. Worf	dives to the side as the boulder smashes the ground in	the place where he just stood.10   ON WORF	As he rolls catlike to his feet, the massive form of an	ALIEN WARRIOR leaps onto his back bringing him back to	the ground. The alien raises a club-like weapon over	his head and swings down at Worf's head.11   RIKER	Catches the alien's arm just before the club makes	contact and drives him off his feet. He kicks him and	follows after him to the other side of the room as:      STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - TEASER      3.12   WORF	turns to face the charge of ANOTHER ALIEN who wields	a battle axe and swings it in a deadly arc. Worf ducks	under the axe and gets a grip on the alien's arm and	they press against each other's strength.13   CLOSER	Worf, grunting in a half-roar, slowly forces the alien	back, then with a bellow and a gargantuan heave, Worf	throws the alien to the side.14   SCENE	Worf leaps at the alien who is caught in half-stride.	Worf drives his forearm into his opponent's throat and	as he becomes limp, drives a double-handed blow to the	back of the alien's head. Worf's enemy drops.15   RIKER	ducks under the alien's club and drives a blow to the	lower extremities of his opponent. The attacker	doubles over and Riker hits him on the way down. But	he no sooner hits the ground than he is back on his	feet, charging Riker. Our first officer steps to his	side and strikes at the alien as he goes by, heading	straight at Worf.16   NEW ANGLE	Worf turns to face the onrushing alien. He thunders	out his challenge, picks up the club from the prone	alien, swings it at the new rival.17   REVERSE	The alien ducks the blow and swings back.18   RIKER	about to enter into the fight, then he holds a beat,	stops and watches somewhat in awe.      STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - TEASER      4.19   WORF / ALIEN	The alien connects with a savage blow to Worf's body.	Worf takes the blow and returns his own.	They trade blows, one for one, taking the pain and	returning it. Then slowly the alien sinks to his	knees, then rolls over on his side.20   ON WORF	as he steps over the alien warrior, roars out his	victorious celebration chant, and lifts the club for	the final fatal blow. His eyes are on fire. He	smashes it down on his opponent, then spins around for	a new battle.21   RIKER	Suddenly a little unsure of Worf's intentions, he backs	a step, waits.22   WORF	Worf sounds out a new challenge. He scans the room for	his next adversary -- he's still coiled and in need of	action. Suddenly he swings his club at the wall.	Pounding it with rage. Broken bricks and mortar fly.	His fury is all consuming. He rips and slashes at	everything standing.23   NEW ANGLE	Riker watches -- still concerned. He thought he knew	the power and fury of this Klingon. Worf continues to	exercise his rage around the room. Anything that	stands, hangs, bulges, protrudes, or is suspended, is	demolished until there is nothing left to flatten.	Nothing left upright except... Worf turns -- his eyes	still blaze as they fall upon...24   RIKER	The only thing left standing. Riker tenses.					RIKER			It's over.      STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - TEASER      5.25   WORF	This seems to have no effect on Worf who seems almost	out of control. A snarl -- low and vicious -- pushes	out of his twisted mouth. He takes a step forward.					RIKER			The exercise is over.26   SCENE	Riker calls more sternly.					RIKER			At ease, Lieutenant!	Worf is almost upon Riker before beginning to regain	control of himself. He takes a deep breath, forcing	himself to become calmer. He flexes his muscles, then	seems pleased.27   EMPHASIZING RIKER (OPTICAL)					RIKER			Exit Holodeck.	The EXIT APPEARS as Riker turns to Worf.					RIKER				(continuing)			You do this every day?					WORF			No -- usually my calisthenics are			more...				(he searches for the				 right word, then				 settles for)			... intense, but those sessions			are too personal to be shared.					RIKER				(dryly)			I'll bet they are.28   RIKER (OPTICAL)	takes a look around at the devastation on the Holodeck	and is thankful that Worf is on his side.      STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - TEASER      6.28   CONTINUED:					WORF (O.S.)			Computer. Program complete --			save.	Before Riker's eyes, THE BATTLE SCENE FADES, and all	that is left is the empty Holodeck. Worf pauses at the	door.					WORF				(continuing)			Coming Commander?					RIKER			Right behind you.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "Where Silence...

No large planets or suns	nearby... just a Milky Way of distant suns spread	across space like a tightly woven blanket of lights.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 42193.6.			We are on a long reach toward the			Morgana Quadrant, a section of			the galaxy which has yet to be			visited by a manned Federation			vessel. We are using the time			to further detail the charts of			this region.30   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Jean-Luc Picard and Riker stand beside Data as he moves	his fingers across the console. The SOUND VARIES,	SLIDING UP AND DOWN ERRATICALLY IN PITCH AND INTENSITY.	Troi stands nearby listening thoughtfully.					DATA			There it is again. An area of			"blackness."					RIKER			It appears, then disappears, then			reappears. There is no			predictable pattern -- no sequence.	Data moves his fingers across the console again.					PICARD			On screen.	They all turn to look.31   FULL SHOT FAVORING THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	The picture on the Main Viewer shows a field of stars.					RIKER			There it is.     STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE     8.31   CONTINUED:					PICARD			I can't see anything. Magnify			section two-eight-five.	The viewscreen changes. Now we can see a slight "spot"	on the Main Viewer.					WESLEY			There -- it looks like a "hole"			in space.					PICARD			We're acquainted with the			"wormhole" phenomenon. This			appears quite different.32   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Picard studies the Main Viewer for a beat, then:					PICARD			What do sensors indicate?					DATA			Nothing.					RIKER			Nothing?					PICARD			I'm sure you must mean it's empty			of matter, Mister Data. There			is always some energy form at			work...					DATA			Sir, our sensors are showing that			to be an absence of everything.			It is a void without matter or			energy of any kind.					RIKER			Yet, this "hole" has a form, Data.			It has height, width...					DATA			Perhaps. Perhaps not.     STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE     9.32   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(to Data)			That is hardly a scientific			observation, Commander.					DATA			Sir, the most elementary and			valuable statement in science...			the beginning of wisdom... is:			"I do not know."				(indicates viewscreen)			I do not know what that is.					WESLEY			Captain, if this were any ordinary			kind of hole in space...				(indicates)			... wouldn't we be able to see			what's behind it?	Obviously, this is a very good question. Picard turns	to Troi.					PICARD			Counselor?					TROI			I can feel nothing from it, sir,			if that's what you're asking.	Picard eases himself down in his chair, and sits	studying the viewscreen... puzzled.					RIKER			Data -- is there any record of any			occurrence even vaguely similar			to this?					PICARD			"Similar" in even the slightest			way.					DATA			Accessing.				(he pauses a moment)			Negative. There is no record of			any Federation vessel encountering			anything remotely like this.					PICARD			I believe we have time for a			closer look, Number One.     STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE     10.32   CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			Concur.				(to Wesley)			Ensign, slow to one-half impulse.			Adjust course to intercept this...			this whatever it is.					PICARD			Scanning and recording as we go.					WESLEY			Changing course to intercept in...			in twelve minutes, sir.33   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	moves slowly forward under impulse power toward the	large black area in the field of stars.34   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard stands watching the viewscreen as the void on	the screen grows larger. Riker is at the science	consoles in the Aft Station. Data is busy at Ops.					PICARD			Let's send a probe into it.					RIKER			Worf, prepare a scanner probe.			Let's see what's in there.					PICARD				(to Wesley)			Close enough, Ensign. Hold this			position.					WESLEY			Aye, sir. Holding this position.	Picard gives Riker a slight nod.					RIKER			You may launch the probe when			ready, Mister Worf.	Worf makes the necessary moves on his console to launch	the probe.     STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE     11.35   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	floats off the outer edge of the void. The probe is	launched. It heads straight into the center of the	great emptiness.36   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard, Riker and Worf stand watching the viewscreen as	the fiery tail of the probe diminishes in the distance.	Data monitors the instruments. We can HEAR THE FAINT	HISS OF THE TELEMETRY as it is received.					DATA			All the probe's systems are			functioning perfectly.	Suddenly the probe just disappears. The SOUNDS OF	TELEMETRY STOP.					WORF			It's gone.					PICARD			What happened, Data?					DATA			Unknown.					WORF				(to Picard)			Recommend we go to a Yellow Alert,			sir.					PICARD				(puzzled)			Why?					WORF				(hesitates, then)			Sorry, sir, it's...					PICARD			Explain.	Worf is definitely uncomfortable now. Clearly, he	would like to avoid this entire subject now. Picard	continues gently:     STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE     12.36   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(continuing)			This starship operates best,			Mister Worf, when we all know what			is on each other's minds.					WORF				(uncomfortably)			My thoughts... were of an old			Klingon legend of... of a gigantic			black space creature which was			said to devour entire vessels...					RIKER				(genuinely surprised)			Devours vessels?					WORF			Sorry, Commander. I agree that			these are thoughts hardly worthy			of a trained and practical			security officer.	There is a round of silence. Worf is completely	miserable. Then to Worf, ignoring his previous	statement.					PICARD			Launch another probe, Mister Worf.			This time a Class One with full			sensor array.	Worf does something on his panel, then:					WORF			Launching, sir.37   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as the second probe is launched. It too disappears	even sooner after it enters the void.38   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	All are still studying the viewscreen.					RIKER			Happened even more quickly.     STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE     13.38   CONTINUED:					WORF			Recommend we fire a photon			torpedo, Captain.					PICARD				(eyes Worf, then)			Negative.					WESLEY			Captain, based on where the probes			disappeared... I have been able			to plot the outer boundaries.			I could move in closer.	Picard thinks about it, then decides.					PICARD			Take us in, Mister Crusher.			Thrusters only.39   OMITTED40   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard stands looking at the viewscreen.					PICARD			Data?					DATA			Still no readings of any kind,			sir.	Picard paces to where Riker stands in the Aft Station.	The black void almost fills the screen of the Main	Viewer.					PICARD			Number One?					RIKER			I'll agree with Worf at this			point, sir. Let's be careful.	Worf looks grateful. Picard paces forward, studying	the viewscreen.41   EXT.

RADIO SIGNALS,	TELEMETRY, EVERYTHING...					RIKER			What's happened?					PICARD			Data?	Data looks at his console for a moment, then...					DATA			Whatever it was... or whatever			it is... we seem to be inside of			it.	Picard returns to his Command Chair, as Riker takes	the chair beside him.					RIKER			Didn't that happen a bit suddenly,			sir?					PICARD			All stations, report!43   ANGLE - THE COMPUTER MONITORS	Some of the screens fade and go blank.

This is			worth studying.					RIKER			Incredible. It's like looking			off into... infinity, sir.				(turns to Picard)			Remember the course in ancient			history at Starfleet Academy?			Back to the time when men still			believed the Earth was flat?     STAR TREK: "Where Silence...

Let's not stay any longer			than we have to.	Riker starts for Science One as PULASKI enters from the	turbolift and stands looking at the activity on the	bridge. Pulaski crosses to stand beside Picard.					WESLEY			Captain, we have no communications			outside of the void.					WORF			Confirm! We are now receiving			no signals of any kind.					PICARD			Hello, Doctor. You've been			briefed on what's happened?					PULASKI			I've heard, Captain.

Wherever we are, sir,			it seems to have no effect on any			Engineering function.					PICARD			Thank you, Lieutenant.47   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard's interest in this occurrence is waning fast.					PICARD			Data?					DATA			Difficult to make a judgment based			on the absence of information.					PICARD			Speculate.					DATA			The obvious hypothesis is			equivocal. This void has a total			lack of dimension. Therefore by			any accepted standard it does not			exist, yet being within it denies			that conclusion.	Picard looks to Pulaski.					RIKER			Then maybe we've moved into			another dimension?					DATA			Could a lack of dimension be			another dimension in itself?	Pulaski gives Data a quick look of respect.					PULASKI			That's an interesting question.     STAR TREK: "Where Silence...

Your minds call it			"death."	At that moment, there is a CRY OF PAIN from the Aft	Section -- and they turn. Holding his head as though	it were about to explode, HASKELL staggers back from	the damaged console. He screams again.					NAGILUM				(continuing)			How interesting.104  ANGLE - FAVORING HASKELL	Haskell sinks to his knees, moaning in agony... then	pitches forward and lies still. Doctor Pulaski has	been hurrying toward him, now kneels and checks his	vital signs. She uses a power-hypo on him once, twice.	Then she shakes her head to Picard.105  ANOTHER ANGLE	Worf has moved in fast too, kneels.					WORF			Sickbay?					PULASKI			It won't help.

We are			unimportant to it.					WORF			In a battle for survival, Captain,			thirty to fifty percent			casualties...					PULASKI			... Would be appalling...					WORF			... But within acceptable limits.					RIKER			This is not a battle, Lieutenant.					TROI			A "laboratory experiment" would			be the closest comparison.					PICARD			Is there any reason for not			believing this Nagilum?    STAR TREK: "Where Silence...

Under the circumstances			-- there is only one decision.			I will not stand by and watch			while half of my crew is			slaughtered.					DATA			Sir... I do not believe there is			anything you can do to prevent			it.					PICARD			No. But I can control it.					PULASKI			How?					PICARD			By destroying the Enterprise.					PULASKI				(to Picard)			Isn't that like curing the disease			by killing the patient?					RIKER			At least it's better than			standing by helplessly and dying.					PULASKI			Why do I feel this may not have			been the best time to join this			ship? I'll be in Sickbay if I'm			needed.	Pulaski exits. Data, Troi and Geordi rise and go out	after her. Wesley and Worf start out.

PICARD'S QUARTERS	The captain is lying on his bunk, staring at the	ceiling as DEBUSSY'S "CLAIR DE LUNE" PLAYS. CAMERA	MOVES IN to examine the expressions passing over	Picard's features as he listens. After several moments	of this, his door CHIME SOUNDS.					PICARD			Come.         STAR TREK: "Where Silence...

Picard straightens into a sitting position,	looks questioningly at her.					TROI			Our destroying ourselves won't			change its mind. I could feel			that.					PICARD				(somewhat surprised)			You didn't mention you were that			certain.					TROI			I was wrong not to tell you,			Captain. And your decision may			also be wrong.	Picard starts to say something, but it's INTERRUPTED	BY ANOTHER SOUND from the door.					PICARD			Yes? Come in, please.114  TO INCLUDE DATA	as he enters, hesitant too.					DATA			I have a question, sir.				(sits)			What is death?					PICARD			You've picked probably the most			difficult of all questions, Data.	There is the beginning of a twinkle in Picard's eyes	again. It is the sort of question that his mind loves.         STAR TREK: "Where Silence... " - 9/27/88 - ACT FIVE         51.114  CONTINUED:					PICARD				(continuing)			Some explain it by inventing			gods wearing their own form...			and argue that the purpose of the			entire universe is to maintain			themselves in their present form			in an Earth-like garden which			will give them pleasure through			all eternity. And at the other			extreme, assuming that is an			"extreme," are those who prefer			the idea of our blinking into			nothingness with all our			experiences, hopes and dreams only			an illusion.					DATA			Which do you believe?114A CLOSE ON PICARD	considering the question.					PICARD			Considering the marvelous			complexity of our universe, its			clockwork perfection, its balances			of this against that... matter,			energy, gravitation, time,			dimension, pattern, I believe			our existence must mean more than			a meaningless illusion. I prefer			to believe that my and your			existence goes beyond Euclidian			and other "practical" measuring			systems... and that, in ways			we cannot yet fathom, our			existence is part of a reality			beyond what we understand now			as reality.	A moment of silence, then:					TROI			We should not let ourselves die,			Jean-Luc!	Picard is startled by the fact this statement comes	from Troi of all people.

It's wrong of you to force			us into this...					DATA			It is wrong...					PICARD				(interrupting)			Yes, this is very wrong. None			of you should be reacting like			this.115  PICARD	as he strides to the Companel on his cabin wall.

There's a look of astonishment on	his face. Except for himself, the cabin is empty.					PICARD			It's not going to work, Nagilum.	Picard stands there, for a beat.					DATA'S COM VOICE			Captain, we are clear.

CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM	Picard is at his desk.					PICARD			Well, Nagilum... I hope you got			what you needed.	A moment, then the Intruder MATERIALIZES on the small	viewscreen. The image is filled with static.					NAGILUM			You have provided me with much			more than I needed...					PICARD			Why did you release us? You			could have seen how we faced			death.					NAGILUM			It wasn't necessary. I have			learned all I needed to know.			Would you like me to share some			of my conclusions?					PICARD			I'm not interested.         STAR TREK: "Where Silence...

You are too			inquisitive not to want to know.				(he pauses)			You seem to find no tranquility			in anything. You struggle against			the inevitable. You thrive on			conflict. You are selfish, yet			you value loyalty. You are rash,			quick to judge, slow to change.			It's amazing you've survived.			Be that as it may -- as species,			we have no common ground. You			are too aggressive. Too hostile.			Too militant.					PICARD			During this period, you too have			been evaluated. It would seem			we have at least one thing in			common.					NAGILUM			Oh?					PICARD			Curiosity.					NAGILUM			The point is well taken, Captain.			Perhaps that is a trait we share.					PICARD			Then perhaps we'll meet again.			But next time, it will be out			here among the stars.	The STATIC CRACKLES Nagilum off and Picard stands for	a beat at the blank screen.117G INT.
