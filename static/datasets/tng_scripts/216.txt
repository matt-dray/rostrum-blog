SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	In orbit around a planet.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 45587.3.			We are picking up a consignment			of chlorinide from Starbase			Twenty-seven for transportation			to the Mylaira system. Once we			have delivered this material, we			will investigate reported subspace			anomalies in the Kelnaria region.2    INT. CARGO BAY	WORF and GEORDI are scanning some LARGE CARGO	CONTAINERS with tricorders. There are other N.D.	CREWMEMBERS in the b.g. checking the containers as	well. The containers have been stacked in an intricate	framework of metal support beams, pallettes, and	lattices which reaches to the ceiling and almost	completely fills the room.					GEORDI				(to Worf)			No question. She was bluffing.					WORF			Bluffing is not one of Counselor			Troi's strong suits.	Geordi works his tricorder for a moment.					GEORDI				(off tricorder, to Worf)			I'm still reading some chlorinide			leakage, but I can't pin it down.	Worf frowns at his tricorder.           STAR TREK: "Ethics" - 12/09/91 - TEASER           2.2    CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(points to different				 section)			Maybe over there...	They move to another section of containers and Geordi	crawls up in the lattice work to take some more	readings.					WORF			It would have been unwise to			call. My hand was not strong			enough.					GEORDI			You had jacks and eights and			she bluffed you with a pair of			sixes.					WORF				(outraged)			Sixes!	Worf fumes for a moment as Geordi climbs down from the	lattice. He suddenly looks at Geordi with suspicion.					WORF			How do you know what I had?	Geordi slowly smiles and then deliberately adjusts his	visor.					GEORDI			Let's just say... I had a special			insight into your cards.	Worf reacts and Geordi chuckles.					GEORDI				(off his look)			Hey, next time bring a deck that's			not transparent to infrared			light.	Worf shakes his head slightly in disgust.					GEORDI				(with humor)			Don't worry, I only peek after			the hand is over.	Geordi checks his tricorder one more time.        STAR TREK: "Ethics" - REV. 12/13/91 - TEASER        3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI				(frustrated, off				 tricorder)			Still nothing.

He moves closer to the	container structure...4    A CARGO CONTAINER	high above Worf. There is a thin wisp of GAS LEAKING	from the container. The gas is MELTING part of the	support upon which the container is sitting...5    WORF	Continues to scan the structure. He moves closer...6    THE CARGO CONTAINER	The structural support GIVES WAY and the cargo	container starts to FALL.7    WORF	hears the RUMBLE from above and starts to move out of	the way, but it's too late.8    WIDER ANGLE	as the heavy containers COLLAPSE on top of Worf.        STAR TREK: "Ethics" - REV. 12/13/91 - TEASER        4.9    INCLUDE GEORDI	who turned around just in time to see the collapse.					GEORDI			Worf!	Geordi and the other crewmembers rush over to Worf and	start to move the containers off of him. They lift one	container and find Worf unconscious. As Geordi hits	his communicator, PUSH IN on Worf's face.					GEORDI				(urgent, to				 communicator)			La Forge to sickbay! Medical			emergency in cargo bay three!	Hold for a beat on Worf's face...									CUT TO:10   INT. SICKBAY	Worf is lying on his back with his eyes closed. He is	dressed in a medical robe and is lying in one of the	diagnostic beds. NURSE OGAWA is standing over Worf.	After a beat, Worf moves slightly.	Worf's eyes finally open and he looks around in	confusion. BEVERLY moves to stand on the other	side of him.					WORF			What... happened?					BEVERLY			The containers you were checking			fell on you. You're lucky to be			alive.	Worf tries to sit up... then stops when he realizes	that he can't move his lower body.        STAR TREK: "Ethics" - REV. 12/12/91 - TEASER        5.10   CONTINUED:					WORF			I will not attempt to leave			sickbay without your approval,			Doctor. The restraining field			is not necessary.	Beverly and Ogawa exchange a look. Ogawa moves off to	give them a little more privacy. Worf looks up at	Beverly in confusion... what's going on here? Beverly	puts on her best bedside manner.					BEVERLY			Worf... there is no restraining			field.					WORF				(objecting)			But I cannot move my legs.					BEVERLY			I know.				(beat)			You can't move because one of the			containers shattered seven of your			vertebrae... and crushed your			spinal cord.	Worf is shocked and this is very difficult for Beverly,	but there's no way to sugar-coat it.					BEVERLY			I'm afraid... there's no way to			repair this kind of injury.	On Worf as he realizes the full impact of what she's	saying...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  STAR TREK: "Ethics" - REV. 12/17/91 - ACT ONE        6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            11   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship still in orbit.12   INT. WORF'S SICKBAY ROOM	Worf has been moved to a private room just off main	sickbay. There are several monitors, some medical	equipment, and a diagnostic bed. Worf is sitting up in	bed and has swung his legs over the side. His face is	a mask of determination as he carefully grips the side	of the bed and moves his feet down to the floor.	Worf manages to get to a standing position, but it's	only by using his hands and arms to maintain an iron	grip on the bedframe. His legs are useless. He	struggles as he tries to will his legs to work.13   NEW ANGLE	As the doors OPEN and Beverly ENTERS. Worf wrenches	his body as he tries to move his legs, but the effort	causes him to lose his grip on the bed. Both legs fold	under his weight... Beverly rushes over to him and	catches him just in time. She helps him back into bed.        STAR TREK: "Ethics" - REV. 12/17/91 - ACT ONE        7.13   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			I know what you're trying to do			and I understand why. But it's			important that you remain in bed.					WORF			Klingons do not... lie in bed.					BEVERLY			They do if they have extensive			internal injuries which need time			to heal.					WORF			The muscles in my legs will			atrophy unless they are used.					(MORE)        STAR TREK: "Ethics" - REV. 12/17/91 - ACT ONE        8.13   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF (cont'd)			A vigorous program of exercise			will be necessary for a full			recovery.	Beverly moves closer to him. Her tone is	compassionate, yet firm as she lays out the simple	truth to him.					BEVERLY			I understand that as a Klingon			this is difficult for you... but			you have to face your situation			as it really is... not as you want			it to be.				(beat)			I've sent for a neurogeneticist,			but... you need to realize that			you'll probably never regain total			use of your legs.          STAR TREK: "Ethics" - 12/09/91 - ACT ONE          9.13   CONTINUED: (3)	Worf looks away, unable to deny the facts away any	longer. A long beat passes.					WORF				(quiet)			Leave me.	Beverly moves toward the door... then stops.					BEVERLY			Your son has been asking to see			you.					WORF				(forceful)			No. I will not have him see me			like this.	Beverly almost argues with him... then decides against	it.					BEVERLY			All right.	She EXITS to...14   INT. SICKBAY - CONTINUOUS	The doors CLOSE behind Beverly after she ENTERS. She	pauses for a moment, depressed and anguished over	Worf's situation. She tries to shake off the	feeling... picks up a PADD and starts to work it.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Bridge to Doctor Crusher. The			Potemkin has arrived and Doctor			Russell is ready to transport			aboard.					BEVERLY				(to com)			I'm on my way.	She heads for the exit.									CUT TO:15   EXT.

DR. TOBY RUSSELL	MATERIALIZES. Doctor Russell is petite and her	features are delicate, doll-like. She has an easy and	friendly manner, but she tends to command a room and	is used to being center stage at any gathering.	Russell has a knack for settling instantly into her	environment, and she already seems very much at home.					BEVERLY			Welcome aboard the Enterprise,			Doctor Russell. I'm Beverly			Crusher.	They shake hands.					RUSSELL			A pleasure.				(to Technician)			I have some equipment aboard the			Potemkin. Please have it sent			to one of your medical labs.					BEVERLY				(to Technician)			Send it to medlab four.	The Technician nods and works the console. Russell	turns to Beverly with a warm smile and then takes	Beverly's arm as they begin to leave the transporter	room.					RUSSELL				(on the move)			Before we get down to business,			I just wanted to say that I had			the pleasure of reading your paper			on cybernetic regeneration			recently.	They EXIT to...17   INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS	Russell and Beverly walk down the corridor. Russell	has definitely turned on the charm.					BEVERLY				(pleased)			Really? You're the first person			to mention it.       STAR TREK: "Ethics" - REV. 12/10/91 - ACT ONE       11.17   CONTINUED:					RUSSELL			Oh, I thought it was brilliant.			Your ideas on bioactive interfaces			border on revolutionary. It's going			to be a genuine pleasure working			with you.					BEVERLY			Thank you.				(beat)			Have you had a chance to review			Worf's case history yet?					RUSSELL			Only briefly. I must admit, I			was a little shocked to find the			state of Klingon neurological			medicine to be so... primitive.					BEVERLY			It's a cultural bias. When I			contacted the Klingon Medical			Division, I was told they usually			let the patient die in a case like			this... as a result they've done			almost no research on			neurological trauma.					RUSSELL				(with relish)			We'll be in uncharted waters.	Beverly doesn't share Russell's anticipation, but she's	not bothered by it either.					BEVERLY			Worf's been having a hard time			dealing with his injuries. He's			always been a difficult patient,			but now...	They have arrived outside of sickbay and Beverly moves	to go inside.

Russell seems to	hesitate for a moment... then speaks in a soft and	understanding voice.					RUSSELL			I know that as a starship doctor,			you have to maintain close ties			with patients. But I think it			would be best if I maintain a			discreet distance. That way, I			can give you a completely			objective opinion regarding			treatment.	Beverly looks at her for a beat... decides that Russell	is making sense.					BEVERLY			Yes... you're probably right.					RUSSELL				(warm smile)			Good. Well... I believe you said			I'll be working in medlab four?					BEVERLY			Yes. This way.	Beverly leads Russell down the corridor.									CUT TO:18   EXT.

Riker	forces himself to smile at his friend and try to put	him at ease.					RIKER			You look pretty good for someone			who's been eating sickbay food			for three days.	Worf makes a half-hearted attempt to return the smile,	then indicates a chair.          STAR TREK: "Ethics" - 12/09/91 - ACT ONE          13.19   CONTINUED:					WORF			Please sit down, Commander.	Riker sits down. Worf is very uncomfortable and	embarrassed. He tries to sit a little straighter...	pulls the bedclothes up a little further on his chest.					WORF			Thank you for agreeing to see me			in... this condition.					RIKER			Worf, I'm not Klingon... I don't			think there's any shame in being			injured.					WORF			I am not merely injured...

This is very difficult for Worf, but he	tries to keep his voice as even and restrained as	possible.					WORF			I have a personal favor to ask.					RIKER			Name it.	Long beat.					WORF			I want you to assist me in			performing the...

MEDICAL LAB (OPTICAL)	A room filled with medical equipment of every size and	description. Beverly and Russell are standing near	a large unit which is projecting a HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE	of Worf's back and spinal column in mid-air. Beverly	is pointing to the damaged vertebrae, which have been	highlighted.					BEVERLY			The cortico-spinal tract has			continued to deteriorate over the			past seventy-two hours despite			CPK enzymatic therapy.	Russell walks slowly around the hologram...	considering the injury from all angles.					RUSSELL			What about alkysine treatment?					BEVERLY			Ineffective.					RUSSELL			Overdesigned.				(off Beverly's look)			Klingon anatomy... twenty-three			ribs, two livers, eight-chambered			heart, double-lined neural pia			mater... I've never seen so many			unnecessary redundancies in one			body.					BEVERLY			Klingon medicine refers to it as			the brak'lul... almost every vital			function in their bodies has a			built-in redundancy in case the			primary organ or system fails.       STAR TREK: "Ethics" - REV. 12/11/91 - ACT TWO       16.20   CONTINUED:					RUSSELL			It's a good design in theory, but			in practice, all the extra organs			mean there's just that much more			that can go wrong.	Russell glares at the hologram for a moment, then	turns to Beverly.					RUSSELL			Let me show you something.	Russell leads Beverly over to a strange-looking piece	of medical equipment that has been moved into the lab	on a cart. It should be even more advanced than our	normal sickbay equipment.					RUSSELL			We've been experimenting with			DNA-based generators... this is			a genetronic replicator. It reads			the DNA coding of damaged organs,			translates that into a specific			set of replicant instructions and			then begins to "grow" a			replacement.	Beverly looks over the odd equipment with curiosity.					BEVERLY			I've read some of the preliminary			work you've done...

Instead of splicing and			pasting together broken			connections like a couple of			glorified tailors, we create a			new, living system.	Beverly takes a beat to consider this... she glances	down at the PADD in her hand... presses some buttons	to move the text forward... she has some serious	doubts.					BEVERLY				(looking for the data)			I had no idea you were already			using this on humanoids...					RUSSELL			I haven't been. This'll be the			first time.					BEVERLY				(reacts)			First time?					RUSSELL			I've done dozens of holosimulations...			the success rate is up to 			thirty-seven percent...       STAR TREK: "Ethics" - REV. 12/12/91 - ACT TWO       18.20   CONTINUED: (3)					BEVERLY			Thirty-seven percent... even a			holographic patient would balk			at those odds.					RUSSELL			Sooner or later it has to be tried			on a living patient.					BEVERLY			We're talking about a spinal			column. Even to attempt it,			you'd have to remove his			existing spine. We don't know			enough about Klingon neurological			medicine to reattach it. If			something goes wrong, he'll die.	Beverly sets the PADD down and regards Russell	seriously.					BEVERLY			I agree it has remarkable			potential but it's still in the			most preliminary stages of research.			We can't possibly justify the risk			to Worf. I'm afraid we'll just			have to make do with the more			conventional approaches.	Russell almost continues to fight... then seems to	reconsider. She smiles slightly at Beverly.					RUSSELL			You're probably right.
