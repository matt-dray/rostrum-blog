Admiral Kennelly has			rendezvoused to discuss the			Bajoran terrorist attack.6    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)	Close on ADMIRAL KENNELLY, standing. Kennelly is a	younger man than Picard, more casual than your average	Admiral. He's not feeling at all well; has a headache	and a cold... the first thing he does when we cut to	him is sneeze...					KENNELLY			Sorry...	He pulls out a handkerchief and blows his nose.	Picard takes a step to a food replicator.					PICARD				(to com)			Ginger tea with honey, very hot.	The replicator makes it in a cup. Picard brings it	over. They sit.					KENNELLY			Ginger tea?					PICARD			My Aunt Rebecca's cure for the			common cold.       STAR TREK: "Ensign Ro" - REV. 7/19/91 - ACT ONE       6.6    CONTINUED:					KENNELLY			Common, hell... I picked this up			from the Cardassian liaison last			weekend. It's some damn virus			they've sic'ed on me.	He inhales the steam from the tea first... his face	shows some relief...7    ANGLE					PICARD			Did the liaison have anything to			say about the attack?	Kennelly sips some tea as he considers his answer a	beat.					KENNELLY			It's an old story for the			Cardassians. They've had			terrorist problems since they			annexed the Bajoran home world			forty years ago.					PICARD			But in forty years, the Bajorans			have never attacked a Federation			target...					KENNELLY			A new militant splinter group has			broken away from the Bajoran			settlement camps. Leader's name			is Orta. Apparently he's willing			to do whatever he has to to get			attention...					PICARD			And our response?					KENNELLY				(shrugs)			We're going to give him attention.				(beat)			I can't tell you how good this			feels on my throat...	Kennelly puts the tea down, sighs... rises, massages	his head to relieve the pain...         STAR TREK: "Ensign Ro" - 7/18/91 - ACT ONE         7.7    CONTINUED:					KENNELLY			Listen, I'm the first to say that			the Bajorans deserve attention...			chased off their own planet by			the Cardassians, forced to wander			the galaxy, settling wherever they			can find room...					PICARD				(acknowledges)			On many worlds we've been to, they			are isolated, treated as			pariahs...					KENNELLY			The Federation has great sympathy			for their cause... but they're			not helping themselves with an			attack like this.				(beat)			That's what you have to			communicate to them.	Picard studies his superior officer, knows there's	more...					PICARD			That could be done through			diplomatic channels, Admiral...			what do you really want from us?	Kennelly nods... takes a beat, then...					KENNELLY			Find this terrorist leader,			Orta... get him back "on the			reservation"... any way you can.	Picard blinks... that's a hell of an order... and it's	one he doesn't care for very much... he almost smiles	incredulously...					PICARD			Any way I can...					KENNELLY			The Federation has dozens of			settlements in that sector. We			can't allow the violence to			continue.       STAR TREK: "Ensign Ro" - REV. 7/25/91 - ACT ONE       8.7    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			And what do I have to offer that			might persuade him to cooperate?					KENNELLY			Amnesty.					PICARD				(not nearly adequate)			Admiral...					KENNELLY			... and a promise that we will			immediately begin to address this			issue with the Cardassians...			quietly, behind the scenes, using			every legitimate means... the			Bajorans have to be patient...					PICARD			They have endured generations of			sympathy and promises. I cannot			believe this Orta will be			satisfied with more of the same.					KENNELLY			It's your job to see that he is,			Jean-Luc.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Riker to Captain Picard.					PICARD				(to com)			Go ahead.									INTERCUT:8    INT.

TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Starting on a grim-faced Riker, clearly upset at	this...					RIKER			Energize.	And as Collins works the controls, move to the	transporter pad as ENSIGN RO LAREN MATERIALIZES. She	is an attractive humanoid woman in her late twenties.	Her eyes gain our first attention, perhaps because her	brows are not separate but connect in a full line over	both eyes... the effect is rather sensual and darkly	intense.	She carries a 24th-century backpack over one shoulder	and is dressed in Starfleet red; on one ear she wears	a silver ring. As she walks off the transporter, she	hands Riker a disc with her orders. She arrives with	all the enthusiasm of a plumber arriving to fix your	toilet just before quitting time.					RO			Ensign Ro Laren reporting as			ordered, Commander.      STAR TREK: "Ensign Ro" - REV. 7/25/91 - ACT ONE      12.10   CONTINUED:	Riker never breaks eye contact to look at her disc.					RIKER			You'll follow the Starfleet			uniform code aboard this ship,			Ensign.	It takes her just a second to realize that he's talking	about her earring. And she glances at Collins with	the incredible smile of a woman who can't believe that	wherever she goes there is one more asshole waiting to	get on her case. Collins gives her nothing back.	Riker silently waits her out.	She says nothing more, but her eyes lock into his and	say "the hell with you" as she calmly removes the	earring. Riker EXITS.
