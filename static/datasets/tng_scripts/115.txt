Admittedly, it's the			closest planet to the Odin. But			the distance we've traveled in the			past two days at warp one would've			taken the Odin escape pods five			months.					DATA			Five months, fourteen days, eleven			hours, two minutes --					RIKER			Thank you, Data.					DATA			-- and fifty-seven seconds.	During this, Tasha reacts to a display at her station.					TASHA			Captain, we're receiving an audio			signal from Angel One.					PICARD			Starfleet was quite adamant that			we maintain excellent diplomatic			relations with this planet. Any			other pertinent information before			we reply, Mister Data? Their form			of government would be a logical			starting place.					DATA			Angel One has evolved into a			constitutional oligarchy.

How			may we assist you, Counselor?					TROI			The Federation has neglected a			visit to your planet for far too			long. With your permission, we			would like to correct that			oversight.          STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - TEASER          4.3    CONTINUED: (3)					BEATA'S COM VOICE			We feel in no way neglected,			Counselor. A diplomatic courtesy			call is neither expected nor			required.	REACTIONS at lack of hospitality. Troi pushes on:					TROI			We also come in search of possible			survivors from one of our			freighters.					BEATA'S COM VOICE			A brief visit will be tolerated.	CLICK.					TASHA			They've broken off transmission.					GEORDI			Ever feel like you're not really			wanted?					PICARD			That's their prerogative,			Lieutenant.				(then:)			Prepare the away team, Number One.					RIKER			Aye, aye, sir.	As Riker, Data, Troi and Tasha stand down, heading	toward the turbolift, Picard returns his attention to	the green planet on his Main Viewer.4    INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR	WESLEY and a BUDDY converge on the Holodeck entrance.	As WE FOLLOW this excited twosome, WE PICK UP Riker	(carrying a METALLIC BOX) Troi, Data and Tasha	APPROACHING from the opposite direction.					RIKER			Where're you boys off to?          STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - TEASER          5.4    CONTINUED:					WESLEY			Skiing, sir.

ANGEL ONE EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY	Steel and glass and concrete, with all the trappings	of a Presidential Suite. The Elected One, BEATA, sits	behind a huge desk. Dressed in utilitarian fashion,	the woman is still very attractive. Hovering over her	is TRENT, her personal secretary. He's shorter in	stature, much more frail than Beata (as are all the	men of this planet). In contrast to his boss, he's	dressed in bright colors. Beata is busy scanning and	signing papers that Trent places in front of her, when:8    ANGLE - THE DOOR	Another male secretary shows Troi, Data, Tasha and	Riker INTO the office, then WITHDRAWS. They stand	before the desk, waiting.9    FULL SHOT	Beata lets our away team "learn their place" as she	continues to ignore them, studying documents, etc.					BEATA			See that these matters are handled			immediately.					TRENT			As you wish, Mistress.	He takes the papers, HURRIES OUT. Finally, Beata	focuses on the away team.					BEATA			I am Beata, The Elected One of			Angel One.					TROI			Mistress Beata, I am Counselor			Troi.				(refers to metal box)			We've brought you a small token			of our goodwill.	Beata eyes the metal box... eyes Riker.					BEATA			My cooperation is not for sale,			Counselor.          STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - TEASER          7.9    CONTINUED:					TROI			We didn't mean to imply that it			was, Mistress.				(beat, and:)			Out of respect to your wishes that			we keep our visit brief, perhaps			you would like to address the			issue of survivors immediately.					BEATA				(curtly)			Immediately -- but not			impetuously. You will present			your case.	She rises. This woman is as tall as Riker.					BEATA				(continuing)			Until I am certain of your			intentions, I know of no such			survivors.	And on this unexpected twist, we:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE         8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:10   EXT. ANGEL ONE - DAY - ESTABLISH (OPTICAL)11   INT. GREAT HALL - DAY	Steel, glass and smooth concrete softened by dripping	ferns and draped sheers. The outer doors swing open	and IN STRIDES our away team. Riker still carries the	metal box.12   ANOTHER ANGLE	TO REVEAL the occupants. A large U-shaped table	dominates the room. At the top of the U is Beata.	Trent stands behind off one shoulder. The flanking	sides of the table are occupied by three (tall) WOMEN	to each side, one of whom will be identified as ARIEL.	Several other male secretaries are in attendance along	the perimeter of the table.					BEATA			Representatives of the Starship			Enterprise -- do you wish to			petition the Parliament of Angel			One?					TROI			We do. We have reason to hope			that survivors from a damaged			Federation freighter may be			marooned on your planet. We are			seeking to learn if this is so.	General stoicism from the Parliamentarians. Except	for Ariel who displays particular interest.	Suspiciously:					BEATA			Even a planet as remote as Angel			One has heard of Starfleet.			Searching the galaxy for survivors			seems a petty task for one of their			mighty vessels.         STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE         9.12   CONTINUED:					RIKER			We don't consider even one			survivor petty.					BEATA				(to Troi, offended)			Is this man suggesting that we			place a lesser value on life than			you do?					TROI			Not at all.	Troi looks to Riker for encouragement. He nods for	her to continue.					TROI				(continuing)			Our discovery of the abandoned			freighter was an accident,			Mistress Beata. We have a duty			to investigate.					BEATA			I see. And if you were to find			survivors? What then?					TROI			We will take them with us. See			that they are reunited with their			families.	Ariel reacts to this, her concern evident.					ARIEL			Mistress Beata... ?					BEATA			Yes, Ariel?					ARIEL			Are we to take these strangers			at their word?					BEATA			A good question.					TASHA			What reason could we possibly have			to deceive you?         STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE         10.12   CONTINUED: (2)					BEATA			Another good question.					RIKER			Are there survivors from the			freighter Odin on this planet?					BEATA			After we discuss that matter,			we'll let you know.	What the hell kind of answer is that? Before it can	be pursued:					BEATA				(continuing; to Trent)			See to their comforts.	Trent leaves his place near the seat of power to escort	the away team from the Great Hall.13   INT. ANGEL ONE GUEST QUARTERS - DAY	As plush as the Great Hall, consisting of common area	with doors leading to separate sleeping cubicles. The	main door OPENS -- Trent LEADS the away team IN.					TRENT			You will remain here until			summoned.	Trent EXITS. Tasha removes a tricorder, checks the	area. As Riker places the metal box on a side table:					RIKER			Are we able to talk? Is the			area secure?					TASHA			Yes. Tricorder doesn't show			any listening devices or			anything else of a threatening			nature					RIKER			Good. Troi?					TROI			There was much fear in that room.         STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE         11.13   CONTINUED:					RIKER			Paranoia, if you ask me. But of			what?					TROI			I cannot say. Nor do I feel their			fear was focused. I sensed that			all were not concerned for the			same reason.					RIKER			Data?					DATA			There are undoubtedly survivors			from the Odin on this planet,			Commander.					RIKER			I agree. Otherwise, why would			they be so circumspect?					TASHA			As the Mistress Beata is so fond			of saying -- good question.					DATA			What do we do if they elect to			deny the existence of any			survivors?					RIKER			Let's not look for problems.	But of course, that's what they are all trained to do.14   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship continues to orbit Angel One.15   INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR NEAR HOLODECK	Picard and WORF are walking down the hallway.					PICARD			I want all departments prepared			for a warp six trip to the Neutral			Zone as soon as the away team			completes its mission.         STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE         12.15   CONTINUED:					WORF			Trouble, Captain?					PICARD			Insurance. Romulan battlecruisers			have been detected near one of			our border posts. They've			requested assistance as soon as			we are available.	Without warning, Picard is hit squarely on the cheek by	a SNOWBALL. He stops cold.16   REVERSE - OPEN HOLODECK DOOR	A laughing Wesley comes TUMBLING OUT, smashing into	Worf as he avoids the pursuit of his buddy. Both skid	to a shocked halt at sight of Picard.					WESLEY			Captain Picard!	Picard wipes the snow from his face. The boys, soaking	wet themselves, cringe.					PICARD			Report, Mister Crusher.					WESLEY			We, ah, finished our ski lesson,			sir... and it kinda just happened,			sir.					PICARD			On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher,			nothing "just happens."				(distracted)			What is that smell?					WORF				(sniffs, and:)			Hmm, yes... slightly reminiscent			of Night-Blooming Throgni,			Captain. From home.				(deep breath)			Quite stimulating, wouldn't you			say?         STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE         13.16   CONTINUED:					PICARD			No.	Wesley tries to smell, but no luck. He glances at his	Buddy who shrugs.					WESLEY			I can't smell anything. I'm			a little congested...					PICARD			Don't let this "just happen"			again, Mister Crusher.					WESLEY				(snapping to)			Yes, sir!!	As the boys wheel and MARCH/RUN OFF, Worf catches	Picard with the hint of a smile. Shaking it off, the	two men continue on.17   INT. ANGEL ONE GUEST QUARTERS - DAY	Tasha pacing; Troi and Riker sitting; Data examining	knickknacks. Data's attention falls on an atomizer.	Squeezing the ball, he gets a face full of mist. Sniffs:					DATA			Interesting. An alcohol-based			synthetic, artificially			reproducing a floral scent.					TROI			It is called perfume, Data.					DATA			The purpose of which is... ?					TASHA			Certain cultures consider perfume			an aphrodisiac.					DATA			I am unfamiliar with that term.					RIKER			An aphrodisiac is something			designed to stimulate or enhance			sexual pleasure.         STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE         14.17   CONTINUED:					DATA			How does stimulation of the			olfactory nerve affect the			enjoyment of sex?	All look to the other to field this one. They are	saved by the door. Trent ENTERS.					TRENT			The Elected One will see you now.	He stands aside so that Riker, Tasha and Troi can EXIT.	Data brings up the rear, putting the atomizer down as	he EXITS. Trent picks up the atomizer, sprays himself,	enjoys the scent a moment before FOLLOWING.18   INT. GREAT HALL - DAY	CLOSE ON Beata.					BEATA			You claim you intend to remove			these survivors from our planet.			Are you prepared to give us your			solemn word on that?19   REVERSE ON OUR AWAY TEAM	standing as before.					TROI			We are.20   FULL SHOT	Parliament in full session as before.					BEATA			You should know that the vote was			not unanimous.

All male.			Their leader is a man who calls			himself Ramsey.					RIKER			If you'll bring these men to us,			we'll have them off your planet			immediately.					BEATA			If they were mine to deliver, I			would do so without hesitation.			Unfortunately, their hiding place			has long eluded us.					TASHA			Hiding place? Why are they in			hiding?					BEATA			Because they are fugitives on			Angel One! And the sooner we are			rid of them, the better!				(calming down)			When these men arrived seven years			ago, they accepted our hospitality			quickly enough. But gradually,			they grew restive.

Worf glances at his scanner	display:					WORF			Scanners indicate a platinum			trace. Should I notify the away			team?					GEORDI			Make it so.	Worf stares and shakes his head in reaction.

Beata and Riker,	seated comfortably on a lounge, each have a drink.					RIKER			... Why were you so hesitant at			first to tell us about the Odin			survivors?					BEATA			Simply because Ramsey and his men			are anarchists. Tampering with			the laws of nature. Obsessed with			spreading untruths, and			encouraging dissent among our			people. I had to be certain you			weren't here to fuel their			struggle.					RIKER			It's not our place to interfere			in the domestic affairs of other			societies.					BEATA			Not you, perhaps, because you			understand a man's place. But			Ramsey is not so well-mannered.				(shakes her head)			Sometimes I fear that it is			actually the men who are the			clever ones, enjoying all that			life has to offer while we women			devote ourselves to the drudgery			of making life work.					RIKER			In our society, men and women			share equally in all that life			has to offer.					BEATA			Don't misunderstand me, Riker.			I'd be the last to imply that men			are in any way inferior to women.			But, after all, men are... men --			with a natural place in the scheme			of things.        STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - ACT THREE        31.42   CONTINUED:					RIKER				(amused)			We gave up those distinctions			centuries ago.

Dismissing him:					BEATA			You may go.	Reluctantly, Trent EXITS. Riker offers Beata the	metallic box.					RIKER			With compliments of the USS			Enterprise.	Their hands linger at the touch before Riker finally	pulls his away. Beata opens the box and withdraws a	large, clear, octagonal CRYSTAL.        STAR TREK: "Angel One" - 11/9/87 - ACT THREE        32.43   CONTINUED:					RIKER			It's called an Albeni meditation			crystal.	Riker removes a small striking bar from the box, taps	the crystal. It comes to life, producing a warm GOLDEN	GLOW and accompanying resonant HUM.					BEATA			Very impressive.	Riker puts his hand over the crystal to turn it off.	Beata covers his hand with her own. There's a lot of	heat between these two, and it's no secret.					BEATA				(continuing)			And now, of course, I must repay			you in kind.	She leans to kiss Riker. He submits.

No vote,			no opinions... no respect.					TASHA			None of which is any longer your			concern, Mister Ramsey. Call the			others in, please.

GREAT HALL - DAY - (TO BE WRITTEN)	Lots of folk. Tasha, Troi and Riker. Ramsey and	Ariel. Ramsey's merry band of followers. Guards.	Beata. The Parliamentarians. Trent. Anyone else we	can find and costume. It's hangin' time.	The thrust of this scene is Riker trying to convince	Beata that the execution of Ramsey will not halt what	can only be perceived as an irrevocable evolutionary	cycle in Angel One's societal development.	After getting Beata to admit that Ramsey and his	followers are merely symbols of a change that preceded	their arrival on Angel One, Riker is quick to point	out that executing these people will only make martyrs	of them. That, in fact, to kill them will accelerate	rather than stop or retard the coming equality between	the sexes of Angel One. Riker might even point out	similar occurrences in Earth's history... I don't	know... depends on how clever he is.	Nevertheless, Riker is able to demonstrate to our	audience, and Beata, that executing Ramsey, et al, will	be counterproductive.	The ladies adjourn to caucus.68   INT.

EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY (TO BE WRITTEN)	Beata, Trent, the away team. Basically, Beata tells	Riker he's pretty smart for a man. She's given his	words a great deal of thought, sees his point, has	(with the help of her parliament) reached a decision.	The Ramsey cult will not be executed. Instead, they	will be exiled to a remote part of Angel One where they	can promote all the heresy they wish. And anyone else	on Angel One who feels the same way can go with them.	This solution won't stop the inevitable decay of Angel	One's cherished system, but at least it will retard	it long enough so that Beata won't have to be around	to see the damage.	Beata urges them to be on their way. She strikes the	meditation crystal, giving in to its soothing warmth	as Riker belays the previous order to "kidnap" the	Ramsey group, and our away team DEMATERIALIZES.74   INT.
