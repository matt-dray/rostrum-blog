SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	leaving orbit around the planet Krios.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 45761.3.			In an effort to bring an end to			their centuries-long war, Krios			and Valt Minor have agreed to			a Ceremony of Reconciliation, to			be held aboard the Enterprise at			a point mid-way between their			two systems.2    INT. READY ROOM	PICARD and the Kriosian Ambassador, BRIAM. Briam is	tall, almost frail-looking, and his people have dark skin	and hair, much in the manner of those from Earth's	Indian subcontinent. Picard hands him a cup of tea.					PICARD			I apologize for the delay in our			arrival; we had to stop at Harod			Four and pick up a group of			stranded miners.					BRIAM			Please, Captain. We are grateful			that the Federation has taken as			much interest as it has in this			matter.					PICARD			Was Mister La Forge able to			provide the special cargo handling			provisions you requested?					BRIAM			Indeed he was. However... until			we reach our rendezvous with the			Valtese, may I ask that the cargo			bay be declared off-limits to all			but the most essential personnel?     STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - REV. 2/21/92 - TEASER 2-2A.       2    CONTINUED:					PICARD			I trust, Ambassador, that this			cargo is not in any way dangerous?					BRIAM			Nothing of the sort. It is a			gift... for Alrik, the Valtese			leader. I am cautious only			because it is quite fragile...			and quite irreplaceable.					RIKER's COM VOICE			Bridge to Captain Picard...					PICARD			Go ahead.									INTERCUT3    INT. MAIN BRIDGE					RIKER				(continuing)			We've picked up a distress call			from a Ferengi shuttle...	Picard frowns.					PICARD				(rises)			Set a course to intercept...					RIKER			Aye, sir...4    INT. CAPT. READY ROOM	As they rise to EXIT...					BRIAM			Captain, the timing of our			ceremony with Alrik is critical.			It cannot be delayed...					PICARD			We'll be at the rendezvous on			schedule, don't worry.5    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	coming out of warp...    STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - REV. 2/11/92 - TEASER    3.6    INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard has joined RIKER, WORF and DATA on the bridge.					DATA			The Ferengi report their			containment field is collapsing...					WORF			We are within visual range.					PICARD			On screen.	The image on the VIEWSCREEN is magnified and the	shuttle is revealed... a trail of some emissions can	be seen, the ship seems to be drifting...					DATA			Their reactor core is unstable,			Captain...					PICARD			How many on board?					DATA			Two, sir.					RIKER				(to com)			Bridge to transporter room three.			Boost your output and lock on			to the two Ferengi on board the			shuttle. We may have to attempt			a long-range transport.					TRANSPORTER OFFICER'S COM VOICE			Standing by.	On the VIEWER, a small explosion aboard the Ferengi	ship...					PICARD			Energize!	Suddenly the entire ship goes.7    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	As the TRANSPORTER OFFICER works his controls. Two	figures MATERIALIZE on the pads...					TRANSPORTER OFFICER			Got them, sir.8    ON TRANSPORTER CHAMBER	where TWO FERENGI now stand, smiling their toothy	grins.      STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - 2/10/92 - TEASER      4.9    INT. MAIN BRIDGE					RIKER			Mister Worf, escort our Ferengi			guests to quarters...				(afterthought)			... not too close to mine.					WORF			Understood.	He EXITS...10   INT. CORRIDOR	As Worf comes around a corner leading the Ferengi...					WORF			Unless you can arrange for your			own transport, you will have to			remain on the Enterprise until			we have completed our mission...					QOL			That will not be a problem.					PAR LENOR			We are in no hurry.					QOL			We look forward to enjoying the			comforts of your fine ship.	Worf leads them to a door which opens into...11   INT. FERENGI QUARTERS	As they ENTER...					QOL			Quite acceptable. Not what we're			used to, you understand... but			it will do.					PAR LENOR			Perhaps your captain would care			to invite us to join him for			dinner this evening...					WORF			The captain dines alone.      STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - 2/10/92 - TEASER      5.11   CONTINUED:					QOL			A pity.	Worf grunts an acknowledgement and leaves. As the	doors close, the Ferengi exchange a glance and laugh.					QOL			That was too easy!	And on their laughter...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                             STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - REV. 2/20/92 - ACT ONE   6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            12   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	At warp.13   INT. CORRIDOR	Picard, Geordi and Briam arrive outside the holodeck...					GEORDI			We've been working from your			drawings, Ambassador... I hope			we're in the ballpark...					BRIAM			Ball - park... ?					PICARD			An old Human expression... Mister			LaForge hopes we've come close			to achieving what you wanted...					GEORDI			Computer, run holodeck program			Krios One.					COMPUTER VOICE			Enter when ready.	The door opens to reveal the interior of an opulent,	golden ceremonial temple... Briam gasps an	appreciation...					BRIAM			Astonishing. It is the ancient			Temple of Akadar.	As they ENTER, the door closes and pan down the	corridor to find the two Ferengi peeking around the	corner... seeing that the ambassador has disappeared	into the holodeck... Par Lenor nods to Qol to get	going... Qol moves away down the perpendicular corridor	as Par Lenor stays...13Athru	OMITTED13B   STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - REV. 2/20/92 - ACT ONE   7.14   INT. HOLODECK - TEMPLE	Still in awe, Briam inspects the setting...					BRIAM			It is this temple that bonds Krios			and Valt, gentlemen... two			brothers once ruled a vast empire			from this site... until they were			torn apart by their love for an			extraordinary woman. This is			where the wars began. And this			is where they shall end.15   INT. CARGO BAY	as Qol slips inside. The room is dimly lit, he looks	around to make sure he is alone. His eyes widen as	he gets his first look at the "gift" he has come to	steal.16   REVERSE ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Suspended several feet off the ground in a zero-gravity	field is a pod about the same size as an Egyptian style	sarcophagus; its decorations, though alien-looking, are	every bit as elaborate. The gravity field casts a	shimmering light on it, giving this floating jewel an	almost magical look.17   QOL	reacts, excited...18   INT. CORRIDOR	As the door opens and Picard, Briam and Geordi emerge	from the holodeck...					BRIAM			There are details of course to			be added...					PICARD			Mister La Forge is entirely at			your disposal, Ambassador...					GEORDI			Just let me know what you need...      STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - 2/10/92 - ACT ONE      8.18   CONTINUED:					BRIAM			Yes, of course... I must consult			several of the historical volumes			that I brought with me...			perhaps we can reconvene later			this...	Par Lenor suddenly appears in front of them... delaying	the Ambassador's exit...					PAR LENOR			Excuse me... excuse me... is it			true? Is a Kriosian ambassador			aboard this vessel?					BRIAM			Yes. Can I help you?	Picard steps in, trying to help the ambassador avoid	the headaches he knows a Ferengi invariably brings...					PICARD			The ambassador is very busy...					PAR LENOR			Ah, do you schedule his			appointments?					PICARD			I am the captain of this ship.	Picard moves the Ambassador down the corridor... the	Ferengi follows...					PICARD				(continuing)			What is it you want?					PAR LENOR			Allow me to present myself. Par			Lenor of the Ferengi Trade			Mission. We are pleased to hear			that you have at last negotiated			peace with the Valtese,			Ambassador. Peace is good for			trade... unless you happen to be			an arms merchant!	Par Lenor bursts into an exaggerated laugh.   STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - REV. 2/10/92 - ACT ONE   9.19   INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)	Qol stacks crates and canisters and climbs up to get	a better look at the sarcophagus...19A  INT. CARGO BAY - ANGLE ON FERENGI (OPTICAL)	looking across sarcophagus.20   INT. CORRIDOR	At the turbolift, Picard waits impatiently for the lift	to arrive... shoots Geordi a look as the Ferengi	continues to drill the Ambassador...					PAR LENOR			... in return for the exclusive			rights to transport all Kriosian			products to the Valt system...					PICARD			May I suggest that you arrange			to meet at another time, after			the ceremony?	The turbolift doors finally open... as Picard ushers	in Briam...					BRIAM			Perhaps that would be best.					PAR LENOR			But...					GEORDI				(takes his arm)			Listen... have you been down to			see the dolphins yet? You really			shouldn't miss them...	Picard gives Geordi a grateful look as he says...					PICARD				(to com)			Deck seven.	The door closes in the Ferengi's face.21   INT. TURBOLIFT	Picard hits his combadge.					PICARD			Picard to Worf.					WORF (V.O.)			Worf, here.     STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - 2/10/92 - ACT ONE     10.21   CONTINUED:					PICARD			One of the Ferengi just waylaid			Ambassador Briam. Keep a short			leash on them, Lieutenant.22   INT. BRIDGE	WORF at tactical.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			I don't want them disrupting this			conference.					WORF			Aye, sir.	Worf begins calibrating the ship's internal sensors.	Reacts as he sees something...					WORF			Security to cargo bay one.					RIKER			Lieutenant?					WORF			One of the Ferengi.	Riker reacts as Worf EXITS into the turbolift...23   INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)	As Worf leads in his security team... sees Qol up on	the makeshift ladder near the sarcophagus... taking	readings with a Ferengi tricorder...					WORF			You! What are you doing?	The sudden intrusion startles Qol and as he turns to	their arrival, the support under him wobbles and falls	backwards, kicking the crates he's standing on into the	sarcophagus... the energy field crackles and shorts	out... and the sarcophagus falls and as it hits the	floor, it cracks open, causing bright shafts of light	to shoot out... and slowly the shell dissolves	(indicating that the casing is constructed from some	sort of "solid" energy).     STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - 2/10/92 - ACT ONE     11.23   CONTINUED:					QOL			This is a misunderstanding... I			was looking for the barbershop...			Apparently I made an incorrect			turn -- and...24   ANGLE	he's interrupted by Picard, Riker and Briam's	arrival... Briam reacts with horror...					BRIAM			No...					RIKER				(to Worf, re: the				 Ferengi)			Get him out of here. Confine both			of them to their quarters and put			a guard on the door.	Worf acknowledges, EXITS with the Ferengi...					PICARD			What is happening?					BRIAM			Emergence...25   ON POD (OPTICAL)	The outer shell is now completely gone, revealing a	cocoon-like structure underneath, as if a Human figure	were wrapped in some sort of organic matter. This, too,	begins to dissolve away. The figure underneath the	organic casing is now becoming visible.26   ON PICARD AND THE OTHERS	They can only stare in amazement.27   ON THE FIGURE (OPTICAL)	now revealed to be the most exotic and beautiful woman	we have ever seen. Her green eyes are set off by her	dark skin and hair; she wears a long, diaphanous gown.     STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - 2/10/92 - ACT ONE     12.28   SCENE	She looks around the room, and though her features seem	to indicate that she was expecting to emerge into an	entirely different setting (the reconciliation	ceremony), she never loses her serene, almost regal	composure.	Picard steps forward, and she focuses her attention	on him.	She gives him a smile so radiant that he is momentarily	struck mute. She approaches him, her eyes locked on	his.					KAMALA			I am for you, Alrik of Valt.	Off Picard's reaction...									FADE OUT                        END OF ACT ONE                               STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - 2/10/92 - ACT TWO     13.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:29   INT. CARGO BAY	Continuous action.					BRIAM			No, Kamala... this is not Alrik.			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard			of the Federation Starship			Enterprise.	Kamala takes a curious beat to study Picard and then	laughs charmingly, embarrassed... (NOTE: with Picard,	she is articulate, direct, thoughtful, wry, Marietta	Tree.)					KAMALA				(with humor)			That explains why you don't look			at all like your holographs. I			apologize, Captain. As an empath,			I could sense your authority.			I assumed that you were			Chancellor Alrik...					PICARD			I'm afraid I require an			explanation...					KAMALA			As do I, Ambassador. Why have			I been brought out of stasis			prematurely?					BRIAM				(to Kamala)			There was an accident...				(to Picard)			Captain, this is quite			complicated, perhaps we should...	As she senses that Picard wants straight answers...					KAMALA			It is not complicated at all,			Briam. And the Captain has no			tolerance for prevarication.				(to Picard)			I am a gift to Alrik of Valt.	Picard reacts... Briam knows that he has a diplomatic	problem on his hands...     STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - 2/10/92 - ACT TWO     14.29   CONTINUED:					RIKER				(to Briam)			You've been using this ship to			transport a sentient being as			property?	During the following, Kamala looks Riker up and down...	measuring him, curious about him, almost as though she	is undressing him in her mind... he feels uncomfortable	with it... a sexual tension is present...					BRIAM			Not as property... as a gift...			I was concerned that you would			not entirely understand...					PICARD			Your concern was justified,			Ambassador...	Kamala turns back to Picard...					KAMALA			You're angry. Why?	And during the following, she does the same thing to	Picard as she did to Riker. Again there is a sexual	tension. Picard absolutely ignores it... which only	interests her more...					PICARD			There is a provision within the			Federation Constitution that			protects an individual's			fundamental rights... once you			were brought aboard this			starship...					KAMALA				(realizing, charmed)			You are coming to my rescue! What			a kind and generous purpose. But			Captain, I do not need to be			rescued...					BRIAM			Kamala is the key to peace between			our two worlds...					RIKER			Why?   STAR TREK: "The Perfect Mate" - REV. 2/12/92 - ACT TWO   15.29   CONTINUED: (2)					KAMALA			In our history there was a woman			known as Garuth who was loved by			the brothers Krios and Valt with			such passion that an empire			fell...					BRIAM			The wars began when Krios			kidnapped Garuth and took her to			our planet...					KAMALA			Like her, I am an empathic			metamorph. The first female			metamorph born on my world for			over a hundred years.					PICARD			A "metamorph"?					KAMALA			A mutant. A biological curiosity,			if you will. With the ability			to sense what a potential mate			wants... what he needs... what			gives him the greatest pleasure...			and then to become that for him.					RIKER				(reacts)			You mean... you change according			to whatever man you're with...					KAMALA			Until I reach the stage of			bonding...

You need not travel			in a cargo bay.					BRIAM			Kamala, remain in your room. I			will speak to you shortly.	She acknowledges and Riker leads her out.30   INT. CORRIDOR	Kamala and Riker walk...					RIKER			Why were you in stasis?					KAMALA			Metamorphs have a long and complex			sexual maturing process. I am			in the Finiis'ral, the third and			final stage. It can be an			uncomfortable transition... Not			only for me, but for the men			around me...					RIKER			In what way?					KAMALA			My body is producing an unusually			elevated level of what you would			call pheromones. The effect can			be quite... provocative.
