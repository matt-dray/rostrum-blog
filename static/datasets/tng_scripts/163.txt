(NOTE: history has just been	changed although none of our characters realize it)	The bridge has now been ALTERED to suggest a more	militaristic atmosphere. The mood is darker, more	somber... our comfortable bridge is more like the nerve	center of a battleship than of an explorer. Even our	uniforms have been slightly altered to emphasize rank	and status.	Troi is gone. Wesley now wears a regular Ensign's	uniform... what were once science stations are now	damage control centers... SECURITY SUPERNUMERARIES	with sidearms are posted near all turbolifts...	Picard's chair is larger and more impressive... patches	and scars on the bulkheads attest to the action the	ship has seen recently. The attitudes of our	characters are more military and formal.
