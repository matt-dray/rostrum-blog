SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Travelling at warp speed.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 45047.2.			The Enterprise is en route to an			uninhabited planet in the El-Adrel			system. The location is mid-way			between Federation space and the			territory occupied by an enigmatic			race known as "The Children of			Tama."2    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)	PICARD, RIKER, TROI, DATA and WORF. The Enterprise is	at warp. A schematic of a Tamarian spacecraft is	displayed at Data's end of the table.					PICARD			The Tamarians apparently arrived			at El-Adrel Four nearly three			weeks ago. They've been			transmitting a subspace signal			toward Federation space ever			since.					DATA			The signal is a standard			mathematical progression. It does			not carry a specific message.					RIKER			But they want us to know they're			there.           STAR TREK: "Darmok" - 7/8/91 - TEASER           1A.2    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Apparently so. Starfleet			believes their presence is an			attempt to start a dialogue.				(to Data)			Commander.	Data indicates the graphic display -- the ship is	formidable looking, covered with alien lettering.         STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/10/91 - TEASER         2.2    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			Federation vessels have			encountered Tamarian ships seven			times over the past one hundred			years. Each meeting was without			incident, but formal relations			were never established because			communication was not possible.					RIKER			Why?					DATA			The Children of Tama were called			"incomprehensible" by Captain			Silvestri of the Shiku Maru.			Other accounts are comparable.					WORF			A cause for concern. For all			we know, they are threatening			our border.					TROI			Everything in the previous			encounters suggests a peaceable			race. We have to start from			there.					PICARD			Agreed. I appreciate your			prudence, Lieutenant Worf. But			given the evidence, Starfleet has			arrived at a reasonable			conclusion. The Tamarians have			extended a hand -- we must do the			same.	A beat as Worf lets it go for now. Riker turns to the	graphic display.					RIKER			The "Children of Tama." I've			heard rumors about them for years.					PICARD			As have I, Number One.	Picard glances at the graphic of the Tamarian ship.         STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/16/91 - TEASER         3.2    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD				(continuing)			Are they truly "incomprehensible"?			In my experience, communication			is a function of patience and			imagination. I'd like to think			we have both qualities in			sufficient measure.3    ANGLE ON THE TAMARIAN GRAPHIC	A beat on the mysterious, powerful-looking vessel.4    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise and a Tamarian starship, as formidable	as the graphic, slightly more robust than our own	craft. The ships are facing each other, in orbit above	a reddish planet.5    INT. BRIDGE - THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	displays a TAMARIAN -- CAPTAIN DATHON -- flanked by	his FIRST OFFICER, and TWO OTHER OFFICERS. Their	uniforms are rich with insignia -- and each wears a	small ceremonial dagger across his or her chest. But	all look the very embodiment of "well-meaning."					DATHON			... Rai and Jiri at Lungha. Rai			of Lowani. Lowani under two			moons. Jiri of Ubaya. Ubaya of			crossed roads. At Lungha.			Lungha. Her sky grey.	He smiles in all friendliness, as if waiting for a	response.6    THE BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf. All are staring at the	viewscreen, a stupefied expression on each face. Data	cocks his head in the android equivalent.         STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/10/91 - TEASER         4.6    CONTINUED:					DATHON				(continuing;				 re-emphasizing)			Rai and Jiri. At Lungha...	A beat. Picard glances at Troi.					PICARD			Counselor...					TROI			I'm picking up nothing but good			intentions, Captain.					PICARD			Data?					DATA			The Tamarian seems to be stating			the proper names of individuals			and locations.					PICARD			But what does it all mean?					DATA			I am at a loss, sir.	Picard faces the alien on the viewscreen.					PICARD				(to screen)			Captain, I invite you to consider			the creation of a mutual			non-aggression pact between our			two peoples. Possibly leading			to a trade agreement and cultural			interchange. Does this sound like			a reasonable course of action?7    INCLUDE THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	Now it's the Tamarians' turn to stare open-mouthed.	They haven't a clue...	The First Officer turns to Captain Dathon.					FIRST OFFICER			Kadir beneath Mo Moteh.         STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/16/91 - TEASER         5.7    CONTINUED:	The other officers laugh -- but the Captain doesn't	find it funny.					DATHON			The river Temarc.	The officers immediately stop their laughter -- as if	ordered to.					DATHON				(continuing; for				 emphasis)			In winter.	His officers look sheepish.8    RESUME BRIDGE	Picard and Riker exchange a glance.					PICARD			Impressions, Number One.					RIKER			They seem to be trying their best.					PICARD			As are we. For what it's worth.					WORF				(indicating screen)			Captain.	Picard and Riker look up at the screen.9    THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	Where the aliens appear to be having a spirited	discussion amongst themselves.					DATHON			Darmok.	The First Officer looks very concerned -- objects.					FIRST OFFICER			Darmok? Rai and Jiri at Lungha.         STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/17/91 - TEASER         6.9    CONTINUED:					DATHON				(shrugs)			Shaka. When the walls fell...					FIRST OFFICER			Zima at Anzo. Zima and Bakor.					DATHON				(firm)			Darmok at Tanagra.					FIRST OFFICER			Shaka!				(indicates situation)			Mirab. His sails unfurled.					DATHON			Darmok.					FIRST OFFICER			Mir--					DATHON			--Temarc!	The First Officer shuts up.					DATHON			The river Temarc...	The First Officer bows his head in complete compliance	-- he's lost the argument.	Captain Dathon reaches out and takes the First	Officer's ceremonial DAGGER.10   INCLUDE BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard watches as the alien captain turns to him -- now	armed with two daggers.					DATHON			Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.	A beat. Suddenly both Picard and the Tamarian Captain	DEMATERIALIZE in a transporter beam.					RIKER			Block their transporter with the			shields! Extend to maximum range!         STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/16/91 - TEASER         7.10   CONTINUED:	Picard completely disappears as Worf hits his console.					WORF			Not enough time!					RIKER				(to Data)			Where is he?					DATA				(off instruments)			The Tamarians have transported			Captain Picard to the surface.			With their own captain...					RIKER				(touches insignia)			Riker to O'Brien --					DATA			-- Transport will not be possible,			Commander. The Tamarian ship has			created a particle scattering			field in the planet's ionosphere.	Riker looks at the viewscreen -- which goes back to an	image of the Tamarian ship.11   EXT. PLANET	A desert filled with scrub-brush and rock. Picard and	the Tamarian Captain are facing each other, separated	by thirty feet of bare ground. Two daggers are in the	alien's hands.	OFF Picard's expression: "What the hell is this all	about?"									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/10/91 - ACT ONE        8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:12   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	and the Tamarian ship, facing each other in orbit above	the planet.13   INT. BRIDGE	Riker, Data, Troi, Worf.					RIKER			Riker to Captain Picard...				(no response)			Captain, do you read me?	Riker turns to Data.					RIKER				(continuing)			Can we compensate?					DATA				(off instruments)			No, sir. The Tamarians are			projecting a particle sustaining			beam into the upper atmosphere.			The result is a hyperionization			that disrupts virtually all EM			and subspace carriers.	Riker thinks for a moment.					RIKER			That means they can't communicate			with their man, either. Or beam			anybody through the field.					DATA			That is correct. However, they			have left sensor frequencies			clear.					RIKER			So they can read what's going on?			Analysis, Mister Worf. What the			hell is going on?        STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/17/91 - ACT ONE        9.13   CONTINUED:					WORF				(shrugs)			A contest, perhaps.				(in explanation)			Between champions. Our captain			against theirs.	Riker considers this for a moment.					RIKER				(remembering)			Theirs was armed...	OFF everyone's reaction.14   EXT. PLANET - CLEARING - DAY	Picard and the alien captain are still thirty feet	apart, facing each other.					DATHON			Darmok and Jalad.	The Tamarian extends the dagger-like weapon he took	from his first officer, as if offering it to Picard.					PICARD				(re: the weapon)			You expect me to fight -- is that			it? A challenge?					DATHON			Darmok and Jalad.					PICARD			I don't know who or what Darmok			and Jalad are. But I didn't come			here to start a war.	Picard makes no move to accept the weapon.					DATHON				(insistent)			Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.					PICARD			I refuse.        STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/16/91 - ACT ONE        10.14   CONTINUED:	Picard crosses his arms. The Tamarian stares for a	beat, then tosses the weapon toward Picard, landing it	a couple of feet away from him. Picard doesn't even	look at it.					PICARD				(continuing)			Would you attack an unarmed man,			Captain? There's not much of a			challenge in that.	The alien watches him for a moment. Scowls. The	Tamarian takes his own weapon out of its chest sheath,	points at the one in front of Picard.					DATHON			Temba. His arms wide.					PICARD				(shakes head)			I'm sorry, Captain.	Picard picks up the weapon, tosses it back in front of	the alien.	They stare at each other for a few beats. The	Tamarian looks frustrated. He reaches down, picks up	the dagger.					DATHON				(almost to himself)			Shaka... When the walls fell...	He moves slowly off toward the edge of the clearing,	keeping an eye on Picard all the way. Picard does the	same, moving toward the opposite end of the clearing.	The Tamarian now ignores Picard completely and starts	clearing out rocks to form a campground. Picard	watches for a few beats. Then starts to do the same.15   INT. BRIDGE - SCIENCE STATION	Data looks up from his instruments. Riker is standing	behind him, waiting for Data's report.        STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/17/91 - ACT ONE        11.15   CONTINUED:					DATA			Sensors show the captain and the			Tamarian in apparent good health,			approximately twenty meters from			each other.	Everyone considers Data's words. A beat as Riker	thinks for a moment.					RIKER				(to Worf)			Lieutenant, hail the Tamarian			ship.	Worf works the panel.					WORF			On screen.16   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	The Tamarian First Officer in his chair, surrounded by	his senior staff. All are grim-faced.					RIKER				(to screen)			You are holding our captain. I			want him released.					FIRST OFFICER			Darmok at Tanagra.					RIKER			Your actions can be interpreted			as an act of war.        STAR TREK: "Darmok" - REV. 7/10/91 - ACT ONE        12.16   CONTINUED:					FIRST OFFICER				(to his staff)			Kiteo. His eyes closed.				(to Riker)			Chenza at court. The court of			silence.				(flash of anger)			Chenza...					RIKER				(to Data)			Is there any way to get through			to them?					DATA			Not without further study.	Riker stares at the viewscreen for a long beat.					RIKER			Mister Worf, close the channel.					WORF			Gladly, sir.	Worf touches the console and the viewscreen switches to	the image of the Tamarian ship.					RIKER				(to Worf)			I want you and a security team			to take a shuttle down to the			planet. Bring back the captain.					WORF			Aye, Commander.	Worf heads for the turbolift.					DATA			Sir, the Tamarians are fully			capable of stopping a shuttle.					RIKER			I'm aware of that. But disrupting			our transporter beam is one thing.			Firing on a shuttle is something			else entirely. I'm betting			they're not gonna push it that			far.           STAR TREK: "Darmok" - 7/8/91 - ACT ONE           13.17   EXT. PLANET - CLEARING - NIGHT18   CLOSE ON A STICK	being twirled by Picard's hands. As a slight tendril	of smoke rises off a small pile of straw...19   REVEAL PICARD	working the stick. He quickly drops it, blows on the	straw, adding more material, until he has a small fire	going... which quickly sputters out.	Picard scowls, looks over across the clearing.20   THE TAMARIAN	is staring back at him, sitting next to a roaring	campfire. He smiles at Picard's failed attempt.					DATHON			Shaka. When the walls fell.21   INCLUDE PICARD	not pleased with the situation.					PICARD			"Shaka" indeed.	Picard stands, giving up on the fire.					PICARD				(continuing)			What now, Captain? Will you			attack me in my sleep?	Picard rubs his arms against the growing chill.					PICARD				(exaggerating)			If I don't freeze to death			first...					DATHON			Darmok of Kanza. Jalad of the			Kituay.	Picard thinks a moment.           STAR TREK: "Darmok" - 7/8/91 - ACT ONE           14.21   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Picard of the Federation.	The Tamarian looks at him blankly.					PICARD				(continuing)			Of the starship Enterprise... Of			the planet Earth...	Picard's words mean nothing to the alien.					DATHON				(to himself)			Kadir beneath Mo Moteh...	The Tamarian shrugs, turns away, ignoring Picard. He	adds some wood to his fire, then crouches on his	haunches like a Bedouin. He takes five ornamental	objects off of his garments, carefully placing them on	the ground.22   THE TAMARIAN	begins a strange ritual, alternately picking up one or	more of the objects and dropping them on the ground,	touching his forehead after each pattern formed by	their fall. His manner is not particularly religious	-- more like habit or custom done without much thought.23   PICARD	watches with curiosity. He rubs his arms unconsciously	against the chill.24   THE SCENE	The alien finishes his ritual, leaving the objects on	the ground. He glances over at Picard -- who is	walking back and forth, keeping his blood going.
