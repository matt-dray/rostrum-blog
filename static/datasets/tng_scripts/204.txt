MELONA COLONY - DAY	A lush and verdant world of hills, grasses, and wild	flowers... no structures there yet, but flags and	taped-off areas suggest buildings to come. Our people	-- RIKER, DATA, BEVERLY -- mingle with civilian humans,	all involved in mapping, measuring, and surveying this	halcyon valley. A portable map table stands in the	clearing; Riker and CARMEN DAVILA, an engineer with a	keen mind and wry wit, inspect schematics of proposed	structures.					CARMEN			... and the hospital facility --				(pointing)			-- will stand there, facing north,			in that grove of trees.	She turns ninety degrees, gestures again.					CARMEN			The school and the arts center			will be here, centrally located			among the residential pods.					RIKER				(nodding)			Looks good. At this rate you			should be ready for the next wave			of colonists in about six months.				(eyeing the terrain)			I have to say I envy you... this			is a beautiful place to put down			roots.					CARMEN			Somehow, Commander... you don't			strike me as the kind that puts			down roots...	He gives her an easy grin.					RIKER			No? How do I strike you?       STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - 7/31/91 - TEASER       2.1    CONTINUED:					CARMEN				(playful)			As... a free spirit. An			adventurer.					RIKER			Ah. And aren't pioneers, like			you, adventurers at heart?					CARMEN			Of course. But we also have			this... nesting instinct. It's			exciting to find a new world --			but the joy comes in making it			a home. Building houses. Having			children. Roots.					RIKER			Very interesting. I'd love to			discuss this further with you.			Dinner tonight?					CARMEN			If you want to share camp rations			in my tent -- I'd be delighted.	The briefest hesitation.					RIKER			Haven't we managed to get a			replicator down here yet?	She laughs merrily... the banter between them is	easy-going and comfortable. It suggests a relationship	that's ongoing.					CARMEN			No, we haven't... but I've been			saving my ration of dried chicken			curry. It should go very nicely			with that bottle of wine I happen			to know you brought with you...					RIKER			It's sounding better all the			time...					CARMEN			And as you know... I provide the			most memorable desserts...	Riker grins. He's obviously had those desserts before.       STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - 7/31/91 - TEASER       3.1    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			My favorite part of dinner...					BEVERLY (o.c.)				(calling)			Will... Carmen...	They turn and Beverly approaches with Data.					BEVERLY			We've been going over the			schematics for the hospital. The			location seems fine...					RIKER			When the Enterprise comes back			tomorrow, we'll bring a crew			down here and get started.	A low WHIRR catches their attention. They stop, look	around for the source of the sound, not yet concerned.					RIKER			Carmen... do you have some			construction started I don't know			about?					CARMEN			No... what is that?	They all look around as the sound becomes more	pronounced. They're puzzled... not really alarmed.					RIKER			Data?					DATA			I do not recognize the sound.	He turns around, trying to catch its direction. The	WHIRRR is louder now, and the breeze picks up a little.					DATA			I believe the sound is coming from			above...      STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" -REV. 8/6/91 - TEASER      4.1    CONTINUED: (3)	All look upward. The brilliance of the sun-filled day	fades a bit... light dims as if a veil were being	pulled across the sky. The other colonists are milling	about, becoming apprehensive.					CARMEN			Will... what is it?	The breeze really kicks up now, and the noise is	building in intensity.					RIKER			Maybe an atmospheric			disturbance...2    ANGLE ON THE SKY (OPTICAL)	from their POV. Across the darkened sky a white spot	of something is approaching -- at an incredible speed.3    RIKER AND OTHERS	stare at the object... Riker's face suddenly shows an	awful recognition, a terrible disbelief.					RIKER			Data -- what's our best bet for			cover?					DATA			There are subterranean caverns			beneath the hills to the east.				(points)			Approximately one kilometer.					RIKER			Carmen, start rounding everybody			up.					CARMEN			But --					RIKER			We've seen it before -- we know			what it is. Now get moving!	She stares at him, then turns and starts running.     STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - REV. 8/2/91 - TEASER     4A.4    ON THE SKY (OPTICAL)	from Riker's POV the approaching object has taken	form... a huge crystal form descending toward the	planet... a vast shimmering, faceted shape... ominous	in its cold beauty. The Crystalline Entity advances	on the outpost.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - REV. 8/6/91 - ACT ONE     5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:		NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.5    EXT. MELONA COLONY - MINUTES LATER	The wind is whipping now, and the SOUND is immense. A	sense of urgency has overtaken the colonists, though	they're trying not to panic. Riker, Beverly, Data, and	Carmen are herding people together.					RIKER			Let's go!				(calling)			Beverly! This way!6    ANOTHER ANGLE	on Beverly, herding people together.					BEVERLY			Okay, people... stay calm... let's			go...	They move in the direction indicated by Riker.7    ON RIKER AND GROUP	as he waves the colonists to follow Data.					RIKER			Follow him! Follow him! Go!	Grateful to have direction, the colonists begin	swarming toward Data, running with him toward what they	hope is safety.     STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT ONE     6.7    CONTINUED:	Riker hurries along the last of the wind-whipped	stragglers, including Carmen, who's helping A CHILD.	Riker runs to them and swoops the child up in his arms.					RIKER			Let's go!	They set out at a run.8    IN THE SKY (OPTICAL)	The Crystalline Entity now hovers above the outpost, a	majestic and ominous form.9    ANGLE ON TREE (OPTICAL)	A brilliant beam of light sweeps down from the Entity	like a giant scythe, cutting a huge swath. The light	encases everything in its path, suffuses it in the	white-hot light... and then sweeps on. The tree and	everything else in this arc of destruction is reduced	to a pile of dust.10   ON THE COLONISTS	as they watch, horrified, still on the run. A few	panic and start to run off to the sides; Data and	Beverly take them by the arm and pull them back with	the group.					RIKER			This way! Stay together!	The colonists run in panic. Bursts of white light	illuminate them as the Entity devours more of the	countryside.11thru	OMITTED1213   ANGLE ON RIKER	hurrying the people along, keeping an eye over his	shoulder at the progress of the Entity. Suddenly --     STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT ONE     7.13   CONTINUED:					CARMEN (o.c.)			Will... help us!	He turns to see Carmen heading for AN OLDER MAN who's	having trouble keeping up. He stumbles; Carmen runs	for him. Riker gives the child to Data and starts	toward her.14   ANGLE ON CARMEN (OPTICAL)	as she heads for the man, fighting the buffeting winds.	Suddenly the arc of light comes sweeping toward her	and the old man... races over them... and they're both	gone. Piles of silt remain.15   ON RIKER					RIKER			Carmen!	He watches her disappear, helpless. Then he	continues his pell mell race for the caves.16   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship is at warp, heading toward Melona.17   INT. BRIDGE	PICARD, WORF, TROI, ENSIGN at the conn, and	SUPERNUMERARIES.					WORF			Captain... sensors are indicating			a disturbance near the outpost			on Melona Four.					PICARD			What kind of disturbance?					WORF			I can't tell. We are still too			far away. It could be an			electrical storm...     STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT ONE     8.17   CONTINUED:	Picard nods. Probably nothing... but he'd like to make	sure.					PICARD			See if you can make contact with			the colony...					WORF			Aye, sir.					PICARD			How far are we?					WORF			At current speed, twenty-seven			hours.	Picard nods, acknowledging.					WORF			Captain, I get no response from			Melona colony. But the			disturbance in the atmosphere is			increasing.					PICARD			Bridge to La Forge...					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			La Forge here, Captain.					PICARD			Are you picking up readings from			Melona?18   INT. ENGINEERING - INTERCUTTING					GEORDI			Yes, sir. Something strange is			going on... there are violent			disruptions in the atmosphere...					PICARD			Ensign... increase to warp eight.	Picard stares at the viewscreen, his instincts telling	him that something is amiss on Melona.       STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - 8/14/91 - ACT ONE       9.19   INT. MELONA - CAVE FRONT - MINUTES LATER	Riker is herding the last of the colonists into the	caverns; behind him, the sound of the wind is fearful,	and bursts of white light frequently illuminate him.					RIKER			Inside... keep moving, deep into			the cave...	Finally the last of the colonists is inside and Riker	follows quickly.20   INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)	Riker and Data at the entrance; Beverly and the others	in b.g. as she does a cursory medical inspection.					RIKER			How much protection will this cave			give us, Data?					DATA			The presence of refractory metals			in the rock formations may act			as an effective barrier.	There is a THUMP and a brilliant flash of light at the	entrance -- the Entity is homing in on them. Riker	draws his phaser.					RIKER			Let's seal this entrance.	He and Data fire at boulders above the cave opening;	they tumble down, blocking it. Beverly approaches.					BEVERLY			I hope there's enough air in here.					RIKER			There should be a ventilation			source somewhere...	They finish sealing off the entrance. It's now dark in	the cave. The fearful THUMPS continue, jarring the	walls like minor earthquakes.					RIKER			We need some light in here...      STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - 7/31/91 - ACT ONE      10.20   CONTINUED:	They train phasers against some of the rocks along the	cave walls, and they begin to GLOW, providing	illumination.					RIKER			How are the others?					BEVERLY			So far it looks like scrapes and			bruises. Will... where's Carmen?					RIKER			Carmen didn't make it.	She gives Riker a glance, but he is stoic.					RIKER			She went back for someone... a			man who'd fallen...	He breaks off; the rest is obvious.					BEVERLY			I'm sorry.	He turns and strides toward the huddled, fearful group	in the cave.					RIKER			I think we'll be safe in here.			I'm not sure about our air supply.			Stay put and don't move around,			don't expend unnecessary energy.			With any luck we can wait this			out.	There are several more THUMPS; a child begins crying.	Beverly continues her ministrations to the injured.	Riker turns and taps his badge.					RIKER			Riker to Enterprise... Riker to			Enterprise...      STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - 8/14/91 - ACT ONE      11.20   CONTINUED: (2)	He sits along a cave wall, and Data joins him.					DATA			Commander, the refractory metals			in the rock strata might also			interfere with communication.	The THUMPS recede in intensity, as though the Entity	were looking for another way in.					RIKER			Data... we've only seen the			Crystalline Entity once before...			how do you know these metals will			protect us?					DATA			I am not entirely certain they			will.					RIKER			That's what I was afraid you were			going to say...	And there is a huge THUMP which says the being is still	out and trying to get at them.21   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	at warp.    STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT ONE    12.22   INT. BRIDGE	as before, Picard in his chair, taut as a coiled	spring.					WORF			Sir... the disturbance on Melona			is becoming more intense.					PICARD			Continue hailing the colony.			All channels.					TROI			Captain... the fact that they're			not responding doesn't necessarily			mean there's anything wrong. The			atmospheric disturbance could be			jamming the signal.					PICARD			I know, Counselor.	But Troi has known the captain long enough to respect	his instincts -- and those clearly tell him something	is wrong.					WORF			Still no response, sir.					PICARD			Ensign, increase to warp nine.				(to Worf)			How long, Mister Worf?					WORF			Six hours.23   INT. MELONA CAVE - LATER	Some hours have passed. Everyone (except Data) is	having trouble breathing now. They're warm,	sweat-stained, clothing in disarray. The thumps are	not heard now. Beverly moves toward Riker.      STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - 7/31/91 - ACT ONE      13.23   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Commander... I have one man			unconscious. We can't stay in			here much longer...					RIKER			If I open that entrance and it's			still out there, we're dead.					BEVERLY			If we stay here we'll be dead...					DATA			It has been over an hour since			we heard the Entity. It may be			gone.					RIKER			And it may be out there waiting			for us.	Suddenly there is a noise at the entrance -- a kind of	a thumping, prolonged, and then a point of sunlight	breaks through the rock and earth sealing the cave.	Riker gets to his feet, moves toward it.					RIKER			Everybody stay back.	Phaser raised, he stands, ready to make a stand,	however futile, against the Entity. There is more	thumping... the hole widens... something moves to cover	it... Riker tenses... prepares to shoot... then...24   WORF'S FACE	appears in the cave opening.					WORF			Commander?25   ANGLE - RIKER	as he breaks into a relieved grin.					RIKER			Lieutenant Worf... I don't think			I've ever seen a more beautiful			sight.    STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - REV. 8/6/91 - ACT ONE    14.25   CONTINUED:	The hole widens quickly as Riker and Data help from	within; the happy colonists rise and move forward.	Worf is first through the opening, followed by Geordi	and ND SECURITY PERSONNEL.	Geordi looks around at the disheveled party.					GEORDI			Good to see you're all right,			Commander. What's happened here?					RIKER			The Crystalline Entity paid us			a visit. We lost two colonists			but got the rest in here...	Geordi looks toward the opening and Riker moves to it,	peers out.26   MELONA - RIKER'S POV (MATTE)	is dead. There's nothing but dust and a few gnarled	skeletal remains of what had been trees, bushes, and	vines.27   RIKER AND GEORDI	as Riker withdraws from the opening, stunned by what	he's seen.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                              STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - REV. 8/6/91 - ACT TWO    15.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:28   EXT.

Riker steps forward.					RIKER			Welcome to the Enterprise. I am			Commander William Riker.	She looks at him curiously as she steps off the pad.	She is a pleasantly soft-spoken woman, friendly and	gracious though a bit reserved.					DOCTOR MARR			Commander... Kila Marr.					RIKER			We're glad you're here.					DOCTOR MARR			You were on the surface... during			the attack.					RIKER			That's right.    STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - REV. 8/2/91 - ACT TWO    16.29   CONTINUED:					DOCTOR MARR			Remarkable. You and your group			are the only beings ever known			to survive an assault by the			Crystalline Entity.					RIKER			We were lucky.					DOCTOR MARR			I should say.				(beat)			And... your android. He was			there, too?	Riker reacts to the dismissive term "your android,"	but stays diplomatically cool.					RIKER			Lieutenant Commander Data was			there, yes.	She eyes him briefly, as though to pursue, but then	smiles.					DOCTOR MARR			Well. Shall we get started?					RIKER			I'd be happy to show you to your			quarters --					DOCTOR MARR			Commander, the chance to talk to			survivors... this soon after an			attack...

It could take			years for anything to grow again.					DATA			Doctor, I ran a full			spectrographic analysis, section			by section. Trace elements			confirm that it was the same			entity which destroyed the colony			on Omicron Theta.	Doctor Marr pays absolutely no attention to Data,	continuing as though he hasn't spoken. Troi notices	this.					DOCTOR MARR			The Crystalline Entity seems to			function like a giant			electromagnetic collector.

I'd like that.	There is a silence and Riker makes no move to depart.	Picard looks up, curious.					PICARD			Something more, Number One?					RIKER			Permission to speak freely, sir?					PICARD			Of course.					RIKER			I've been thinking... maybe Doctor			Marr is right. Maybe we should			destroy the Entity.					PICARD			And why do you think that?					RIKER			It's killed thousands. It will			undoubtedly keep on killing...			unless we stop it. I don't want			those deaths on my conscience.      STAR TREK: "Silicon Avatar" - 7/31/91 - ACT FOUR      44.45A  CONTINUED: (2)	Picard regards him... suspecting there's more to it	than that.					PICARD			Are you sure that's it? Or are			you being influenced by personal			feelings?	Riker takes refuge in a certain indignation.					RIKER			With all due respect, sir... I'm			not a raw cadet. I've lost people			on missions before.				(beat)			Carmen was a good friend. But			that's not why I'm saying this.	He moves toward Picard, emphatic.					RIKER			If we take the time to try to			communicate with this thing, we			may lose our chance to destroy			it.

But what			would you want me to say?					DOCTOR MARR			Maybe... something from his			journals...	Data considers this for a moment, while accessing his	memory files.					DATA			Many of his journal entries took			the form of letters to his			friends and family. I could			access one of those.	She nods and turns away from him, hands clenched,	awaiting this moment with almost unbearable	anticipation. When Data speaks, it is in the voice	of an adolescent boy.					DATA				(as Renny)			I took my last exam today... I			think I did all right on			everything except cellular			biology. I know you think it's			important, Mom... but I don't see			how I'm ever gonna use this stuff.	Doctor Marr's hands are clapsed together tightly as	she listens.					DATA				(as Renny)			In a couple of weeks, a bunch of			us are going on an archaeological			dig in the mountains.
