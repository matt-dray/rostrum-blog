PICARD'S QUARTERS	PICARD and BEVERLY are seated at the table, finishing	up the last remnants of a large breakfast. The fare	this morning consists of some strange-looking soup with	the consistency of molasses and plates of exotic	fruits. Beverly eats heartily, thoroughly enjoying	every bite -- Picard is somewhat restrained... making	vague motions at the soup and mostly contenting himself	with a cup of tea and a biscuit.	Picard seems a little distracted, but otherwise, the	atmosphere is very casual and relaxed.					BEVERLY			She's been very secretive... every			time I ask her about it or try to			edge around the subject, she			changes the subject. Personally,			I think she's in love.					PICARD			Mmmmm.					BEVERLY			Didn't you hear me? I said, she's			in love.	Picard's not sure what sort of response Beverly's	looking for.					PICARD			Yes?          STAR TREK: "Attached" - 09/07/93 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Is that all you can say?					PICARD			What would you like me to say?			I'm very pleased for them both.					BEVERLY			Both of who?	Picard thinks for a moment... but he has no idea.					PICARD			The two... people we were			discussing.	Beverly gives him a look and after a beat, she leans	forward with a mock-scolding look on her face.					BEVERLY				(with a smile)			You don't have the slightest idea			who I'm talking about, do you?	Picard finally drops all pretense and laughs as he	picks up a cup of tea.					PICARD				(laughing)			No... no, I'm sorry... but I			really don't.					BEVERLY				(smiling)			I'll try not to take that			personally... I've been talking			about Nurse Ogawa and Ensign			Markson for almost fifteen			minutes.					PICARD			Oh, now it hasn't been that long.					BEVERLY			How would you know? You haven't			heard a thing I've said since I			got here.					PICARD			You're right. I'm sorry.					BEVERLY			Are you worried about this mission			with the Kes?       STAR TREK: "Attached" - REV. 09/07/93 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED: (2)	Beverly's hit it on the head. Picard picks up his cup	of tea and leans back in his chair.					PICARD			Not worried exactly... just			uneasy. This notion of admitting			half of their planet to the			Federation while leaving the other			half out...					BEVERLY			Well, first of all, the Kes are			not half the planet, they're			almost three-quarters of it. And			the Prytt are not being left out --			they simply don't want any outside			contact with the Federation or			anyone else.					PICARD			Every member of the Federation has			entered as a unified world... and			that unity said something about			them... that they had resolved			certain social and political			problems at home and were ready to			join a larger community.					BEVERLY			From all indications, the Kes are			a very unified, very progressive			people.					PICARD			But the Prytt are not. They are			reclusive to the point of			xenophobia.					BEVERLY			Think about Earth -- what if one			of the old nation-states, say			Australia, had decided not to join			the World Government in twenty-one			fifty? Would that have			disqualified us from being a			Federation member?					PICARD			That analogy is not entirely --					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Riker to Captain.          STAR TREK: "Attached" - 09/07/93 - TEASER          4.2    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD				(to com)			Go ahead, Number One.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			We've received word from			Ambassador Mauric that he's ready			to see you and Doctor Crusher.					PICARD			Inform him we're on our way.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Acknowledged.	Picard gets up and puts his jacket on. Beverly grabs	a couple more bites of soup as she grabs her lab coat.					PICARD			Thank you for breakfast.					BEVERLY			Wait until tomorrow... I have			something very special planned.			It's a Vulcan dish -- that's all			I'll tell you.	They EXIT.                                             CUT TO:3    INT.

DARK CELL	A small, dingy prison cell -- damp and inhospitable.	Picard lies prone on the floor. Beverly is propped up	against a wall. Both are unconscious.	Slowly, Picard begins to come to his senses. Shaking	the cobwebs out of his head. He spots Beverly.	Realizes something terrible's happened. He tries to	key his insignia, but it's nowhere to be found.	Picard moves to Beverly's side and gently shakes her.					PICARD			Beverly... Beverly...	Her eyes flutter open.					BEVERLY			What happened?					PICARD			I don't know.					BEVERLY			The last thing I remember... was			beginning the transport...	Picard unsteadily stands and begins to look around the	room.					PICARD			I would assume that we're on			Kesprytt... in some kind of			prison cell.	He turns his back to Beverly and examines the closed	door to the cell.					PICARD				(continuing)			The question is why?

She turns his head	around and now we can see some kind of electronic	IMPLANT at the base of his neck. Beverly examines it	gingerly.					BEVERLY			It's an implant... looks like it			might be connected directly to the			brainstem.					PICARD			Some kind of coercive device... ?	Beverly reaches behind her own neck with a hand... then	nods -- she has one too.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			Whatever they are... I doubt			they're designed for our health.	The door to the cell suddenly slides OPEN and MINISTER	LORIN ENTERS. She is a tall, elegant, woman dressed in	sleek military regalia. Lorin scans them both with a	Kes version of a tricorder. TWO ARMED GUARDS step into	the cell with her and the door CLOSES behind them.					PICARD			Why are we being held?	But Lorin is more interested in the readings on her	device than in answering Picard's questions. She	continues to work the small tricorder.         STAR TREK: "Attached" - 09/07/93 - ACT ONE         8.4    CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY			If you tell us why you've taken us			hostage, we might be able to --	Lorin flatly and unemotionally cuts her off without	looking up.					LORIN			You are not hostages. You are			prisoners.					PICARD			Prisoners. By whose authority?	Lorin closes her tricorder with a snap and then eyes	them with the dull interest of a keeper checking over	an exhibit.					LORIN			You are being held under the			authority of the Prytt Security			Ministry. The charge is			conspiring with the enemy.					PICARD			The enemy... you mean the Kes.					LORIN			We are not fools. We are aware of			the Federation attempt to			establish a military alliance with			the Kes. It will not be			tolerated.					PICARD			Your information is in error.			There are no plans to enter into			any --					LORIN			There is no point in trying to			mislead us, Captain. The devices			which have been implanted in your			cerebral cortexes will soon be			calibrated to your psi-wave			patterns. At that time, we will			get all the information we need.       STAR TREK: "Attached" - REV. 09/09/93 - ACT ONE       9.4    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			And you will discover that we're			telling the truth.	Lorin gives him a polite and tolerant smile.					LORIN			We shall see.	Lorin now taps in a command on her tricorder, and the	door OPENS again.

DARK CELL	Picard is meticulously studying one section of the cell	wall with infinite patience... he's looking for any way	out of here. Beverly is sitting calmly against one	wall watching him. They've been here for quite some	time. After a few beats, Picard stops probing the wall	and turns around to give Beverly a questioning look.					PICARD			What?					BEVERLY				(confused)			What?					PICARD			You're staring at me.					BEVERLY			Sorry. I was just wondering how			long you were going to keep at			this.					PICARD				(returns to the wall)			As long as it takes.

Beverly gets to her feet and	Picard tenses, looking for an opening. But the Guard	is wary and careful... he keeps his weapon out and	ready as he sets the food tray down on the floor, never	taking his eyes off the prisoners. The Guard then	slowly backs out the door, which then CLOSES behind	him.	As the door slides into the wall, Picard jumps to the	doorway and tries to keep the mechanism from completely	closing, but it's no use and the door CLICKS shut.					PICARD			Damn.	Picard examines the door frame.					BEVERLY			Well, at least this means we're			not going to starve to death.					PICARD				(grim)			What it means is that they plan on			keeping us here for a while...	Beverly takes a deep breath... she hadn't considered	that.					BEVERLY			I'm starting to think negatively,			Jean-Luc.	A few silent beats pass...
