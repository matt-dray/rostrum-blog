CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM	PICARD at his desk, scanning a screen of data,	schematics of the Galaxy Class starships, as:					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			This rendezvous is necessitated			by dangerous malfunctions which			are plaguing our sister ship.			Perhaps with both crews working			together we will be able to			eliminate the problem -- before			we are detected by the Romulans.	He taps a touchpad, turning off the screen.3    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	The Ready Room doors open and Picard steps onto the	bridge.					PICARD			Mister Crusher -- how long to			rendezvous?         STAR TREK: "Contagion" - 01/04/89 - TEASER         2.4    VARIOUS ANGLES AS NEEDED	WESLEY, WORF, and TROI are at their stations. RIKER	is at Science One with DATA. Picard crosses to his	seat.					WESLEY			Four minutes, thirty-three			seconds, sir.					PICARD			Status of download, Mister Data?					DATA			Entire Yamato log will be in our			computer by rendezvous.					RIKER				(to Data)			Have you nailed down our little			hiccup yet?					DATA			Sir?					RIKER			The odd reading.					DATA			No. It might be due to the			problems currently being			experienced by the Yamato.					PICARD			Trouble, Number One?					RIKER			I'm not sure, sir.				(to Worf)			We are alone out here?					WORF			Yes, sir. There are no other			vessels in the area except the			Yamato.				(checks his panel)			Which is coming into viewer range			now.	Riker takes his seat next to Picard. Data moves back	to his station.       STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/10/89 - TEASER       3.5    COMMAND AREA AND VIEWSCREEN - ANGLES AS NEEDED	(OPTICAL)	The screen displays a majestic view of the approaching	USS Yamato, a twin of the Enterprise. Picard and Riker	rise and move toward the viewscreen.					WORF			Transmission from the Yamato,			Captain -- on visual.	On screen is CAPTAIN DONALD VARLEY, about Picard's age,	but brawnier and white-haired. He is standing near	the executive officer's chair. To either side of him	are two crewmembers who are inspecting an open panel	which shows scorch marks and scattered isolinear chips.	A third crewmember crosses in the foreground.					PICARD			Donald, what's a nice Starfleet			Captain like you doing in a place			like this?					VARLEY			It's good to see you, Jean-Luc,			despite your antique humor. I			only hope your people can help			us. The malfunctions are becoming			serious. We lost an engineering			team when the computer shut down			the forcefield in an open shuttle			bay. Eighteen people.	Picard and Riker exchange a look of shock.					RIKER			And no idea what's causing these			problems?					VARLEY			None. They are affecting every			system simultaneously. It's like			the ship has suddenly decided to			fall apart.				(a forced little laugh)			It's beginning to make me think			we should have run these Galaxy			Class ships across a few more			drawing boards before we built			one.					PICARD			Are you suggesting it's a design			flaw?      STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/10/89 - TEASER      3A.5    CONTINUED:	Varley is a man under intense pressure who is burying	it deep. He's had to call on an old friend for help.	He feels helpless and frightened. He has also	committed a major offense by entering the Neutral Zone.	He's talking a little off the top of his head.       STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/10/89 - TEASER       4.5    CONTINUED: (2)					VARLEY			I don't know. I'm grasping at			straws here. All I know is that			we've got to get it fixed, and			before I lose more than an			engineering team.					RIKER				(urgently)			Do you wish to evacuate			non-essential personnel to the			Enterprise?					VARLEY			No... that would be premature.					PICARD			Donald, we'll get our teams to			work. I'm sure neither of us			feels too comfortable sitting			around the Neutral Zone.					VARLEY			I know what you're thinking, what			the hell am I doing here? Well,			I had heard rumors about a couple			of archaeological digs that			started making the Iconians sound			a lot less like legend. I did			a little investigating, and I			located their homeworld.					PICARD			In the Neutral Zone.					VARLEY			In the Neutral Zone.					PICARD			Don, this was quite a risk to			run just to satisfy an			archaeological curiosity.					VARLEY			No, the risk would be in allowing			the Romulans to locate Iconia.	The viewer image of Varley breaks up in STATIC, fading	for a beat, then returns.       STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/10/89 - TEASER       5.5    CONTINUED: (3)					VARLEY				(continuing)			Fortunately, I got there first.			It's a virtually dead planet, but			enough of the technology remains			to give the Romulans an edge if			they were ever to find it.	During Varley's speech, more break-up occurs.					PICARD			Don, your transmission is breaking			up.				(rising, then to Data)			Clean that up.					WORF				(tensely)			Sir, there is an energy build-up			in the Yamato's engineering			section.	Picard whirls back to face the screen.					PICARD			Yamato, this is the Enterprise,			come in Yamato.	More STATIC.					WORF			Magnetic seals in the antimatter			chamber decaying!					PICARD			Captain. Don!	The viewer image of Varley BURSTS INTO A BLINDING WHITE	FLASH. PULL BACK to show the Yamato exploding.					PICARD				(continuing)			Shields up!         STAR TREK: "Contagion" - 01/04/89 - TEASER         6.6    INT. MAIN BRIDGE AND VIEWSCREEN - VARIOUS ANGLES	(OPTICAL)	The bridge crew reflexively shield their eyes. The	flash subsides, and the viewscreen defaults to a	forward view of space and a barrage of fiery objects,	hurtling toward the ship. KLAXONS SIGNAL RED ALERT as	the objects batter the Enterprise. The ship is	pounded (SFX) and shakes violently.					WORF			Sir!	Worf is staring at the viewscreen. Picard and Riker	follow his gaze and stared, stunned, as the Yamato's	saucer section, engulfed in flames and explosions,	sails past, narrowly missing the Enterprise.					DATA				(quietly)			Sensors indicate no life readings			from the Yamato's saucer section.					WORF				(looks up from his				 instruments)			Captain! Another vessel coming			into sensor range.				(ominously)			It is Romulan.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/09/89 - ACT ONE      7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:7    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	On the Main Viewer is the Romulan battle cruiser.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, supplemental. The			Yamato's entire crew and their			families, more than a thousand			people, have been lost.	Data is at Ops. Wesley is at the Conn station. Riker	is seated at his normal position. End on Picard as he	finishes the log.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			Circumstances, unfortunately,			permit us no pause for grief.					WORF			No response from the Romulan			vessel.					RIKER			Arm phasers and prepare to lock			on target.					PICARD				(to Data)			Did they attack the Yamato?					DATA			Unknown, sir.					WORF			All their weapons systems have			been fully activated.

She is	seated in what we assume to be her command position on	the Romulan bridge.					TARIS			Explain yours!					PICARD			Are you responsible for the			destruction of the Yamato?					TARIS			No. And believe me, Captain, had			we chosen to exercise our right			to defend the Neutral Zone, we			would not have stopped with one			starship. You will leave at			once.	Picard makes a slashing gesture to Worf who cuts the	com.					PICARD				(looking to his bridge				 crew)			Comments?					TROI			She is extremely anxious --					WORF			Understandable if she just			destroyed a Federation starship.					RIKER			Your scan was inconclusive. We			can't be sure of what happened			to the Yamato.					TROI			Our presence in the Neutral Zone			is provocative. It could force			her to respond.         STAR TREK: "Contagion" - 01/04/89 - ACT ONE         9.8    CONTINUED:					PICARD				(to Worf)			Open com. We will comply when			we have determined the cause of			the Yamato's destruction. And			when we are fully satisfied that			you were not responsible. Picard			out.	The Romulan response is to disappear.					WORF			They are engaging their cloaking			device.					RIKER			Good. They can't fire when			they're cloaked.					WORF			Unless they have overcome that			deficiency. The Yamato was			destroyed while they were cloaked.					PICARD			Forget the Romulans. I want to			know what happened to the Yamato.			Number One, assemble the staff			for a conference in one hour.			And I want answers.					RIKER			Aye, sir.9    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	stationary, holding in space.10   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Riker, Data, Worf, and GEORDI are present. Geordi	stands by a screen containing a schematic of the	Yamato and a blow-up of the affected engineering	section. There is a pulsing red dot in the engine	area.      STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/06/89 - ACT ONE      10.10   CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(pointing)			Sensor recordings reveal that what			we witnessed was an uncontrolled			and catastrophic matter/antimatter			mix. The magnetic seals between			the chambers collapsed --					PICARD			That's not possible.					GEORDI			Yes, sir, it is, but a highly			improbable series of events has			to take place before such an			occurrence can result.					PICARD			Explain.					GEORDI			In the event of a breach of seal			integrity there is an emergency			release system which dumps the			antimatter.					DATA			Apparently such a dump began, was			then halted, and the containment			seals were dropped. There was			still sufficient antimatter			present to lead to the result we			observed.	They all look back to the schematic where that deadly	red dot is still pulsing.					PICARD			Then there is no evidence that			a weapon was used?	Troi enters and moves to a chair. Seats herself.					TROI			I'm sorry I'm late. I was with			the children. They have been			deeply affected by the Yamato's			destruction.	There is a beat while they consider the cost in human	terms of this tragedy.      STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/06/89 - ACT ONE      11.10   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Mister Data.					DATA			Evidence of a weapon? No, sir,			none.					GEORDI			However it happened, the Yamato			did it to herself.					PICARD			Theorize. What do you think			caused this catastrophic			malfunction?					GEORDI				(looking very grim)			I think Captain Varley may have			been correct. There could be			a design flaw.					RIKER			In a Galaxy Class starship?	Murmurs and physical reactions of consternation from	the officers. Picard is stone faced, unmoved.					GEORDI			Yes, sir. It's the most			complicated piece of machinery			ever built. Something could have			been overlooked.					PICARD			Knowing where the flaw is located,			do you think you can isolate and			solve the problem?					GEORDI			We're working on it now.					PICARD			Pull any and all personnel who			might be useful to your task.	They rise, ready to scatter to their assigned tasks.      STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/06/89 - ACT ONE      12.10   CONTINUED: (3)					TROI				(to Picard)			If we have established that the			Romulans were not responsible for			the destruction of the Yamato,			would it not be prudent for us			to withdraw?					PICARD			If this is a design flaw, we			better stay where we are and			give Geordi time to work. Or			what happened to the Yamato			could happen to us.10A  EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	remaining stationary.11   INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM	Picard is standing near his desk, staring at his	unactivated console. This is a duty he'd like to skip.	He sits down.					PICARD			Computer, access Captain Donald			Varley's personal log. Search			parameter, locate entries			containing the words Romulan and			Iconia.					COMPUTER VOICE			Working.12   COMPUTER VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	Top of the screen shows a date and time code. Varley	is slowly turning an alien-looking device in his	hands. It is corroded and appears to be very old.      STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/10/89 - ACT ONE      13.12   CONTINUED:					VARLEY			Personal log. It was kind of			Doctor Ramsey to allow me to carry			away my own little piece of legend			from the archaeological dig on			Denius Three. My engineers have			examined it, but are completely baffled			by the technology. What was its			purpose? I'm like a caveman			confronted by a tricorder. I'm			certain this device is Iconian.			But how far had it travelled			before it was abandoned on an			alien world?	A new image appears. Varley: elated.					VARLEY				(continuing)			Personal log. A galactic Rosetta			stone. The starfield shown on			the artifact was unintelligible			until I took into account two			hundred millenia of stellar			drift. After that it was easy			to pinpoint Iconia.	Screen blips. New image. Varley: thoughtful.					VARLEY				(continuing)			My first officer is questioning			the wisdom of my order to			violate the Neutral Zone, but			I am convinced I have taken the			only proper course. Should this			advanced technology fall into			the hands of the Romulans, we			might as well dock our ships			and defend ourselves with sticks.	Screen blips. New image. Varley: grim faced.					VARLEY				(continuing)			Personal log. We've been spotted			by a Romulan cruiser, but after			playing hide and seek through			several solar systems, I think			I've managed to elude them.        STAR TREK: "Contagion" - 01/04/89 - ACT ONE        14.12   CONTINUED: (2)	Screen blips.

I am unable to send			an away team to the surface of			Iconia, nor can I scan the energy			source on the planet because of			these maddening system failures.			It is infuriating to be stopped			at the threshold of a dream by			one's own ship. We are leaving			orbit to rendezvous with Picard.			If his people can't help us repair			the Yamato, I must convince him			to continue this exploration.			The future well being of the			Federation may depend upon it.	The image blips out.					COMPUTER VOICE			No further entries conforming to			search parameters.	For a long, grim moment, Picard stares at the blank	screen. He then rises and starts to exit. But the	doors fail to open. He steps back, giving the doors	a quizzical look, then steps forward again. This time	the doors open normally. He exits.13   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Riker is in the Command Chair. Data is at Science One.	Picard crosses to the android.					PICARD			Mister Data, there is a reference			in Captain Varley's personal log			to a probe which scanned the			Yamato.      STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/09/89 - ACT ONE      15.13   CONTINUED:					DATA			Yes, sir. We have a visual			record.					PICARD			Put it on Main Viewer.14   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	The image does not fill the entire screen. Next to	it are a series of read-outs and a reference to the	fact that this is from the Yamato log. Rising into	view from the surface of a planet comes the probe.	It is spherical, about the size of a beachball. It	has a hard, transparent shell and, within it, a deep,	translucent blue gel, flecked with bits of reflective	material. It stops at "eye-level" and emits a BURST	OF CRACKLING, SPIDERY ENERGY directly INTO CAMERA.					RIKER			What the devil is that?					PICARD				(to Data)			Have you ever seen anything like			that before?					DATA			No, sir, but it appears to be			a scanner. Possibly a			transmitter.					RIKER			Transmitting what?					DATA			Unknown, sir.	Picard crosses to his Command Chair.					PICARD			Engineering.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			La Forge.					PICARD			Progress on your matter/antimatter			scan?        STAR TREK: "Contagion" - 01/04/89 - ACT ONE        16.14   CONTINUED:					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Everything continues to check			out.

Picard studies the boy's	serious face.					WESLEY			It's about the Iconians, sir.			I'd always heard that they were			just a myth.					PICARD			China was thought to be only a			myth until Marco Polo travelled			there. No, the Iconians were			real.

Ancient texts refer			to them as the Demons of Air and			Darkness, but that could have			so many different interpretations.					WESLEY			Air and darkness?					PICARD			Legend has it that they travelled			without the benefit of spaceships.			Merely appearing from thin air			on distant planets.					WESLEY			That sounds like magic.					PICARD			Wouldn't we seem magical to a			stone-age people?					WESLEY				(responding to Picard's				 enthusiasm and echoing				 it)			How did you find out about all			this?					PICARD			Archaeology has been a hobby since			my Academy days. But why don't			we talk about what really brought			you here?					WESLEY			I can't stop thinking about the			Yamato.

The little we know was			passed down by the descendants			of the people who attacked this			world. I'm beginning to think			the Iconians may have been the			victims of some very bad press.					DATA			Sir?					PICARD			There's an unfortunate tendency			in most cultures to fear what they			don't understand. It is possible			that their enemies, when confronted			with this technology, were driven			to attack the Iconians out of			fear.	Worf turns back to the gate to contemplate Picard's	words. Picard and Data return to the console.	Occasionally Data runs scans with his tricorder.	Suddenly the bridge of the Enterprise appears.					WORF			Sir!     STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/11/89 - ACT FOUR     41.36   CONTINUED: (5)	The other two whirl at the note of urgency in his voice	and have a brief glimpse of the Enterprise before it is	replaced by an alien landscape. The Romulan bridge	appears, vanishes; and we again have an alien	landscape.					WORF			Was that really the Enterprise?					PICARD			I believe that it was. Gentlemen,			we have a way home.				(a beat)			I think the Iconians might have			outfoxed their enemies. Perhaps			they didn't all die in the			bombardment; some may have passed			through this.	Data runs more scans with his tricorder.					DATA			Sir, there is a vast underground			power source which is controlled			by this console.	He points to a bank of lights which had not been lit	previously, but are now glowing brightly.					DATA				(continuing)			My triggering of the gateway has			caused a dramatic upsurge in power			levels.				(runs more scans)			Ah, I have access.	Symbols appear on one side of the screens. Data	studies them. He begins to input using the keys on	the console.					WORF			Sir, the Enterprise again.					PICARD			Time the rotation.     STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/09/89 - ACT FOUR     42.36   CONTINUED: (6)	Suddenly the globe emits a HIGH-PITCHED TONE followed	by a beam of sickly green light. There is a SOUND OF	CRACKLING as the ray envelops Data. It travels the	length of his body, rendering him immobile. The energy	flow stops, and Data -- stiff as a board -- starts to	topple. He is caught by Worf who eases him to the	floor. Data lies unmoving, eyes open but devoid of	expression, staring at the ceiling.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                                   STAR TREK: "Contagion" - REV. 01/10/89 - ACT FIVE         43.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:37   INT.

He has	to peel back the android's fingers because Data has	such a grip on the device. Data's equilibrium is shot,	and he walks in a tight circle around himself.

Time?					WORF			Three minutes.					PICARD				(to himself)			I am running out of time. We			all are.	Picard kneels beside Data and pulls him up until the	android is supported against his shoulder. Worf lays	the tricorder on the floor of the chamber and fires his	phaser at it. The tricorder VANISHES.					PICARD				(continuing)			This room and the technology			contained in it must be destroyed.			It cannot be allowed to fall into			Romulan hands.					DATA			I understand...					PICARD			How!

Damn, I			forgot you can't see.					DATA			Help.	Picard rightly assumes that Data wants to be helped	to the console. With Worf's help they get the Android	to his feet and over to the console.
