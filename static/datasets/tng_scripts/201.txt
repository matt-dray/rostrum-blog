Worf moves to Kurn.					WORF				(quietly)			We cannot win. We must withdraw.	Kurn's head snaps around.

OBSERVATION LOUNGE	PICARD and RIKER are seated across the table from FLEET	ADMIRAL SHANTHI and a N.D. STARFLEET ADMIRAL. Shanthi	is the head of Starfleet, and is a woman of African	descent in her late fifties with an almost regal	bearing. She is listening to Picard while the N.D.	Admiral looks on with disapproval.					PICARD			There have been three major			engagements in the last two			weeks... all of them won by ships			loyal to the Duras family.					SHANTHI			None of which is our concern,			Jean-Luc. The Klingon civil war			is, by definition, an internal			matter of the Empire.        STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - 7/1/91 - TEASER        4A.12B  CONTINUED:					PICARD			Agreed. But if the Duras are			being aided by the Romulans, then			it becomes very much our concern.	Picard takes the plunge and forcefully lays out his	views as Shanthi watches him more closely        STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - 7/1/91 - TEASER        5.12B  CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD				(continuing)			The Romulans have been trying to			destroy the Federation/Klingon			Alliance for over twenty years,			and at the same time, the Duras			have been secretly conspiring with			the Romulans.				(beat)			Doesn't it strike you as odd that			the Duras are able to field such			an overpowering force against			Gowron? That they outmatch him			at almost every turn?					SHANTHI			Some would call it good			leadership.	Picard refuses to let up... he's arguing with passion	and conviction.					PICARD			And some would say they must be			getting help.				(beat)			The Romulans have always been			willing to take enormous risks			in order to gain any advantage			over the Federation.				(with force)			Can we seriously believe that now,			with the future of the entire			Klingon Empire hanging in the			balance, they are content to			simply stand by and watch?	There is a pause as Picard waits for a reaction.					SHANTHI			What is it you propose, Captain?	Riker suppresses a grin in the b.g.... the captain's	got her.      STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - REV. 7/2/91 - TEASER      6.12B  CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			We must stop the flow of supplies			and equipment from the Romulans			to the Duras family.				(beat)			I propose we take a fleet of ships			to the Romulan/Klingon border.			We'll take no offensive action,			but we'll be in a position to			expose any Romulan shipments that			try to cross the border.					SHANTHI				(musing)			A blockade...				(beat)			But how will you overcome the			Romulan cloaking device?					PICARD			My chief engineer has developed			a system that should help us			nullify that advantage. Each ship			will send out an active tachyon			beam to the other ships in the			blockade fleet. In theory, any			cloaked vessel that tries to pass			between our ships should cross			one of those beams and be			detected.	Shanthi studies him silently for a moment and considers	his plan.					SHANTHI			I'll have to clear this with the			Federation Council...				(beat)			In the meantime, assemble your			fleet, Captain.	With that, Shanthi and the N.D. Admiral EXIT. Picard	and Riker move to follow them and Riker quietly speaks	to Picard on their way out of the room.					RIKER				(quietly)			Nicely done... I hope you know			what you're doing.        STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - 7/1/91 - TEASER        7.12B  CONTINUED: (4)					PICARD				(quietly)			So do I, Number One.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - REV. 7/2/91 - ACT ONE     8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:13   EXT.

READY ROOM	Riker, DATA, and GEORDI are standing before Picard,	who is studying some PADDs they've brought him. They	contain lists of available ships.					RIKER			Starfleet is stretched pretty thin			across the quadrant. There are			only twelve ships within one day's			travel of this position.					GEORDI			The only other ships available			are either in spacedock for			repairs or still under			construction. Most of them don't			even have full crews yet.					RIKER			But we could probably pick up			seven... maybe eight more ships.	Picard ponders the PADD for a moment.					PICARD			Mister La Forge, will we be able			to implement your tachyon			detection grid with twenty ships?     STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - REV. 7/3/91 - ACT ONE     9.14   CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(dubious)			It's possible...				(beat)			But the more ships, the bigger			the net we can throw.	Picard drops into deep thought for a long beat... then	picks up the PADD.					PICARD				(decisive)			I want to add the Tian Nan Men,			the Hermes, and the Sutherland			to join us whether the yard			superintendent thinks they're			ready or not. Mister Data, select			a group of experienced officers			from the Enterprise to augment			the crews of those ships.					DATA			Yes, sir.					PICARD				(to Riker)			Will, I want you to command the			Excalibur. Her crew was			reassigned when she put in for			repairs. Geordi, you'll serve			as his first officer.	Riker and Geordi give him confident nods.					PICARD				(continuing, to				 everyone)			I want the fleet to be underway			by oh nine hundred tomorrow.			Thank you, gentlemen.	Riker and Geordi EXIT, but Data remains behind with	a slightly puzzled look on his face.					PICARD			Yes, Data?					DATA			May I ask a question of a...			personal nature, sir?       STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - 7/1/91 - ACT ONE       10.14   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Yes.	Data thinks for a beat.					DATA			Why have I not been assigned to			command a ship in the fleet?	Picard is caught off-guard and is quite frankly	embarrassed.					PICARD			Well... I felt that you were			needed here.				(beat, then curious)			Why do you ask?					DATA			You have commented on the lack			of senior officers available for			this mission. I believe that my			twenty-six years of Starfleet			service qualify me for such a			post.				(beat)			However, if you do not believe			the time has arrived for an			android to command a starship, then			perhaps I should address myself			to improving---					PICARD			Commander... I believe the			starship Sutherland will need a			captain. I can think of no one			more suited to the task than you.	Picard holds out his hand and Data shakes it.					DATA			Thank you, Captain.	Data EXITS.

KLINGON NIGHTCLUB	If the Hell's Angels owned a posh country club, it	would look something like this. The club is designed	for food, drink, and merriment, Klingon-style. The	room is filled with N.D. KLINGONS and the atmosphere is	loud and raucous, with only a thin veneer of	civility... like a controlled riot.	Some groups of Klingons can be seen drinking foul	concoctions and laughing uproariously... two large	Klingons continue to hit each other in the face and	laugh loudly following each blow as if that only made	the joke funnier.17   ON WORF	As he ENTERS, carrying a PADD. In contrast to everyone	else, he glowers around at the scene of revelry. A	couple of Klingon women give him the eye as he passes,	but his interest lies elsewhere. He finally spots Kurn	sitting at a table with a Klingon captain named LARG.	He moves toward them.18   NEW ANGLE	Kurn and Larg are drinking and laughing loudly as Worf	approaches.					KURN			You always did have fools working			for you, Larg... now you don't			have as many!	Kurn slams the table and roars in laughter. Larg is	having a good time as well.					LARG			You were lucky, Kurn... but luck			always runs out. Someday I will			stand over your broken corpse and			drink to the victory of the Duras!	Larg laughs a hearty laugh and throws the flagon	against a wall. Kurn and Larg now notice Worf. Kurn	is pleased to see his brother.       STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - 7/1/91 - ACT ONE       12.18   CONTINUED:					KURN				(stands and claps Worf				 on shoulder)			Ah, Worf... good.				(indicates Larg)			This piece of baktag is Captain			Larg. He commanded the squadron			that tried to destroy us			yesterday.	Worf doesn't quite know how to react, so he simply	looks at Larg.					LARG				(stands)			The infamous Worf, son of Mogh.				(pretends to looks Worf				 over)			What are you wearing? That's the			uniform of a Klingon.	Larg laughs and Worf starts to move toward him, but	Kurn lays a gentle, yet firmly restraining, hand on his	shoulder. Kurn's smile never fades, and although there	is laughter in his voice, it also contains just a hint	of warning.					KURN				(to Worf)			The Capital City is neutral			ground... and Larg's men are all			around us.				(beat, then pointed to				 Larg)			As are mine.	Larg and Kurn continue to smile at each other for a	minute. They're duelists who've met away from the	field of honor... tomorrow they'll happily kill each	other.					LARG			Good to drink with you, Kurn.				(pounds the pitcher				 of drink on the table)			May you die well.					KURN			Die well, Larg.	Larg moves away and Kurn watches him carefully, never	taking his eyes off Larg until he's safely away.       STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - 7/1/91 - ACT ONE       13.18   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF				(disapproving)			You drink with our enemy...	They sit down. Kurn takes another long pull on his	drink and then leans in closer to Worf.					KURN				(indicates room)			How many are Gowron's men... how			many are Duras? Does it matter?			When we meet in battle we'll fight			to the death, but here... we're			all warriors... all Klingons.	Worf nods... he understands the concept, but it still	runs against his personal grain. Kurn is relaxed,	thoroughly enjoying himself, but Worf can't seem to	unwind like his brother... he's a little too tightly	wrapped for that. Worf seeks refuge in	professionalism.					WORF				(reading PADD)			The repairs on the Hegh'ta are			proceeding.

OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Picard is waiting near the windows. Sela and an N.D.	SECURITY GUARD ENTER. Picard nods to the guard, who	then EXITS. Sela immediately strides into the room,	looking around, pacing like a jungle cat, covering the	room as though marking territory. She is lithe,	genial, confident -- and definitely going for the upper	hand.					SELA			Well, Captain... what is this			"urgent matter" we need to			discuss?					PICARD			I'm afraid you misinterpret our			presence here.

Sela is not quite sure what	he has or what he knows, and continuing to fence with	him might simply reveal her hand. She decides to	change tacks.

I'm full of them.			Nothing in my experience can assure			me that what you say is true...			but I do know one thing: it will			not affect my judgment in our			next encounter.	She turns to the door, then back to him:					SELA			You have fourteen hours, Captain.			I suggest you use them wisely.	And she exits to the security guard who is waiting	outside the door.

Lursa looks him over	quickly.					LURSA				(to Romulan, re: Worf)			Kill him.	As Lursa and B'Etor move to the far side of the room,	the following happens very quickly:	AN EXPLOSION IS HEARD from very close outside the	door, startling everyone. Worf uses this momentary	distraction to dispatch the Guard with a few	well-placed blows to the knees and stomach.74   ON LURSA & B'ETOR (OPTICAL)	The sisters don't care about Worf, the Guard, or	Toral, they're bitter over the defeat and just want to	get the hell out of here. Lursa pulls a small device	from a pocket and activates it as Toral moves to join	them, but he doesn't move quickly enough and the	sisters DEMATERIALIZE in a transporter beam. Toral	is shocked that they've left without him.         STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - REV. 7/9/91 - ACT FIVE        56.74   CONTINUED:					TORAL			No!!	At that moment, the door bursts open and a couple of	heavily armed N.D. KLINGONS ENTER with Kurn close	behind. Kurn goes to his brother... Worf almost	collapses, but Kurn catches him before he falls and	Worf is able to steady himself against the wall. Kurn	finally notices Toral.					KURN				(mocking)			Toral... next Leader of the			Empire.				(smiles)			Gowron is looking forward to			seeing you again.	Toral tries not to show the terror gripping him... but	he's not quite successful.									CUT TO:75   EXT.

Although			there was a positive outcome as			a result of my actions, I have			learned that... the ends cannot			justify the means.					PICARD			No, they can't.				(thoughtful beat)			However... the excuse "I was only			following orders" is the epitaph			of too many tragedies in our			history. Starfleet does not want			officers who will blindly follow			orders without analyzing the			situation.				(beat)			Your actions were appropriate for			the circumstance, and I have noted			that in your record.	Data turns to leave.					PICARD			Mister Data...	Data stops.					PICARD				(less formal)			Nicely done.        STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - REV. 7/15/91 - ACT FIVE        57.76   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			Thank you, sir.	Data EXITS. Hold on Picard as he allows himself to	smile slightly at how well Data has learned.									CUT TO:77   INT. KLINGON GREAT HALL	Gowron is in the leader's chair, and the KLINGON	COUNCIL is now standing beside him. Picard stands	before the Council. Gowron is looking at a Starfleet	PADD.					GOWRON				(looks up at Picard)			The Council appreciates your			report, Captain. The information			on the Romulan supply ships will			prove very useful.				(beat)			Before you leave, there is one			last matter to attend to.	Gowron nods to someone o.c.77A  NEW ANGLE	As Kurn and Worf ENTER. Worf looks much better than	we last saw him, but there are still some scars visible,	and he has a slight limp. Worf straightens at the	sight of Picard, and the two men share a silent moment	of reunion. But there is still other business to	attend to...					GOWRON				(continuing)			Bring him!        STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - REV. 7/15/91 - ACT FIVE        58.78   NEW ANGLE	As a KLINGON GUARD ENTERS with Toral. The boy keeps	his head up, determined to go out like a Klingon.					KURN			Toral, son of Duras... you stand			convicted of treason.	Toral musters his courage.					TORAL			The Duras family will one day rule			the Empire!					GOWRON				(smiles)			Perhaps... but not today.				(beat)			Worf...	Worf steps forward.					GOWRON				(continuing, to Worf)			This child's family wrongly took			your name and your honor from			you...				(beat)			In return, I give his life... to			you.	Gowron hands Worf a knife and steps back. Toral tries	to steady himself as everyone watches.79   ON WORF	He struggles... is this what being Klingon really	means? Worf looks up at Picard, who is watching to see	what he will do. Worf and Picard share a silent	moment... Worf looks from the captain to the knife in	his hand... finally drops the knife to the ground.	A buzz of confusion goes around the room. Kurn moves	quickly to his brother.					KURN				(quiet, urgent)			What's wrong? Kill him!					WORF			No.         STAR TREK: "Redemption II" - REV. 7/3/91 - ACT FIVE        59.79   CONTINUED:					KURN				(incredulous)			This is our way... the Klingon			way.					WORF				(with glance at Picard)			I know... but it is not my way.				(beat, to Gowron)			This boy has done me no harm...			and I will not kill him for the			crimes of his family.					GOWRON				(shrugging)			Then it falls to Kurn.	He gestures to the knife. But before Kurn can move--						WORF			No. You gave his life to me...			and I have spared it.	Gowron frowns... he's puzzled, but decides not to push	Worf.					GOWRON			As you wish.	Worf moves toward Picard.80   OMITTED81   ON WORF & PICARD	Worf and Picard look at each other for a beat...					WORF			Permission to return to duty, sir?	Beat.					PICARD			Granted.	They EXIT together, never looking back.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
