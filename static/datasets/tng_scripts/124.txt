ENTERPRISE - GYMNASIUM	It is starkly and simply set up for competitive saber	fencing. PICARD and RIKER are dressed in traditional	white jumpsuits, gloves, shoes and masks. They stand	in the middle of three long lanes about six feet apart.	They snap their masks in place.	PICARD MOVES HIS	right leg forward, weight centered, hand on hip. His	saber is down.	HE TURNS THE SABER	so the cutting edge of the blade moves to the left,	then brings it to his head with a flourish.					PICARD			En garde.	PICARD STEPS FORWARD	as his blade comes up, pointed at the Riker's face.	THEIR BLADES CROSS	as Riker half-lunges forward, arm extended, to a chest	shot.

He does a full	lunge forward, with a downward slice.	RIKER HIGH BLOCKS	the move, and lunges forward with a flank cut to	Picard's ribs. He continues with a fleche, then a head	cut, continuing with fleche parries.	RIKER SCORES	with an inverted thrust to Picard's heart. Picard	steps back and salutes. Riker answers in kind.	THEIR MASKS	come off, but not their rank.					RIKER			I took advantage...					PICARD			No, no. The advantage was yours,			Number One. I'm out of			practice... too much time on the			bridge. En garde!	PICARD REPLACES HIS MASK	and they begin again.	PICARD FAKES RIKER	out with a cheek cut, turning his blade down, then, in	a swashbuckling movement, he SLAMS the heel of his	sword right on Riker's guard, comes in with a cheek	cut, then rolls the sword and quickly lunges in with a	head cut, pulls the sword back in and THRUSTS it to	Riker's heart. Riker is surprised as	PICARD SCORES	and they step back and salute each other with their	swords.					RIKER			Interesting move. What technique			was that?          STAR TREK: "...

Memories of youth and of love.	THE WAITER INTERRUPTS	his reverie with a menu.					EDOUARD			Some wine, some cheese, a perfect			tarte tatin...					PICARD			I'm afraid I'm not hungry. I			really came for the view.					EDOUARD			Perhaps what you hunger for is			not on the menu?					PICARD			Perhaps not. It was many years			ago, I had a rendezvous -- I was			to meet someone, a young woman,			here, at this very table.					EDOUARD			She did not come?					PICARD			I don't know, actually.
