Began			an analysis today of the			respiratory problems being			experienced by the populations on			the two moons of Peliar Zel.				(beat)			Finally got an actual letter from			Wesley... topped the class in			exo-biology, but he's still			struggling in Ancient			Philosophies.				(beat)			And... there's... a new man in			my life.									CUT TO:2    CLOSE ON BEVERLY AND ODAN KISSING	A passionate kiss of some duration which, when they	break, leaves them both flushed and breathing deeply.	They stare into one another's eyes for a brief instant,	and then start as they hear a door opening.3    INT. TURBOLIFT - WIDER SHOT	We now realize they are in a turbolift, the doors of	which have opened to admit DATA, who greets them with	delighted surprise. If he notices their flushed and	rumpled condition, he gives no indication.					DATA			Ambassador Odan... Doctor			Crusher... I was just on my way			to see you.        STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/6/91 - TEASER        2.3    CONTINUED:	Beverly tries to compose herself, resisting the impulse	to smooth her hair and check her lipstick. Odan, on	the other hand, seems perfectly comfortable.					BEVERLY			Hello, Data...					DATA			I have completed my study of the			atmospheric variations which have			occurred on the moons since the			new technology was implemented.					ODAN			Thank you, Commander. That will			be most helpful in my efforts to			mediate the quarrel.					DATA			I could go over them with you now.			It would not require more than			two hours.	A brief, electric silence.					BEVERLY			We do appreciate it, Data... but			the Ambassador and I have set			aside this time... to analyze			the incidence of lung disease			among the moons' inhabitants.					DATA			Then it is perfect timing, Doctor			-- what better occasion to			integrate my results into your			study?	Another silence, as Beverly and Odan exchange glances	past Data's innocent eyes. Her message: "You get rid	of him."					ODAN			Now that I think about it,			Commander... you're absolutely			right. Unfortunately, I'm not			feeling well... perhaps Doctor			Crusher could get you started,			inputting your information... but			I must I return to my quarters.           STAR TREK: "The Host" - 3/1/91 - TEASER           3.3    CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY				(picking it up)			Ambassador, are you still having			those awful headaches?			I'll bring you a hypospray to take			care of it...					ODAN				(rubbing temples)			I would be most grateful...	The turbolift stops, and Beverly takes Data by the arm,	steers him out of the turbolift.4    INT. CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS)	as Beverly and Data exit. She turns back to Odan.					BEVERLY			Put a cold cloth on your forehead			and lie down, Ambassador. I'll			be with you shortly.	And the turbolift doors shut on Odan, unable to resist	an anticipatory smile. Beverly pulls Data down the	corridor at a good clip.					BEVERLY			I'll set you up at the medical			monitor, Data... it'll take you			a while to input the figures,			won't it?					DATA				(puzzled by the speed)			At least an hour... but I do not			believe much time can be saved			from that estimate by exhibiting			such haste now...					BEVERLY			Data... there are times... when			every second does count.	And she propels him down the corridor, oblivious to	his perplexed expression.        STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/6/91 - TEASER        4.5    INT. ODAN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	Odan ENTERS and begins removing his shirt. He is a	handsome, strapping man with a well-defined	musculature. He moves toward the mirror, and places	his hand on his diaphragm.	A grapefruit-sized area on his mid-section begins to	change color... then it swells into a purplish,	green-veined lump. Odan takes a device from the	counter, aims it toward the bulbous protuberance, and	envelops it in a spray of light. The growth throbs	there for a moment, then begins to recede again.	Whatever it is, Odan has just fed it, and it is content	once more.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/6/91 - TEASER        5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:5A   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	drops out of warp.6    INT. ODAN'S QUARTERS	Beverly is donning her jacket, stops in front of the	mirror to run her fingers through her hair. Odan puts	on a robe and comes up to her, putting his arms around	her from behind. In the background, the bed is	discreetly rumpled.					ODAN			Somehow, I had an unnatural fear			that Data was going to barge in			and ask to discuss the peripheral			effects of magnetospheric energy			taps.	Beverly giggles and he kisses her hair.					BEVERLY			If I don't get back and look at			his projections, he might come			looking for me.	She pulls loose, but he turns her around, facing him,	not letting go.					ODAN			When I first met the formidable			Doctor Beverly... I thought to			myself... "This woman is ice...			through to her bones... "	He puts his face in her neck, murmuring.					ODAN			Who would have dreamed... that			instead of ice, there is fire...	Beverly closes her eyes, yielding to his soft nuzzling.					BEVERLY			I can't believe this has			happened... in just a week...       STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT ONE       5A.6    CONTINUED:					ODAN				(kissing her face)			Stay here... don't go...	Blood is coursing now, but Beverly manages to pull away	slightly.          STAR TREK: "The Host" - 3/1/91 - ACT ONE          6.6    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Odan... are we... is this...			interfering? With your work on			the Peliar Zel problems?					ODAN			Fortunately I've done about as			much as I can until we get there.				(bending to her again)			Because I wouldn't be able to			keep my mind on work now...					BEVERLY			Odan... I have to get back...					ODAN			Promise me we'll be together			tonight...					BEVERLY			I promise...					ODAN			Then go, Doctor Beverly...	She reaches out fingertips, touches his lips.					BEVERLY			It's just Beverly...					ODAN			Not just Beverly. It's Beverly's			smile and her kindness, her			beauty, within and without. So			much more than just Beverly...	He takes her wrist, turns it and kisses it gently on	the inside. Then --					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Picard to Ambassador Odan...	The two lovers jump guiltily apart. Odan reaches for	his tunic, presses the com badge.					ODAN			Yes, Captain? This is Odan...					PICARD'S COM VOICE			The Federation representative from			Peliar Zel has come on board.					(MORE)        STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT ONE        7.6    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD'S COM VOICE (Cont'd)			Could you meet us in the			Observation Lounge?					ODAN			I'll be right there, Captain.	He and Beverly exchange smiles.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			And Ambassador... if you should			run into Doctor Crusher, would			you ask her to join us as well?					ODAN			By all means. If I run into her.	He turns smiling to her and, though feeling a little	like a naughty child who's been found out, she smiles	back.7    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - A BIT LATER (OPTICAL)	Picard is already there, standing with LEKA, a	representative of the Federation planet Peliar Zel,	RIKER, TROI, and Data. Beverly ENTERS, nods toward	Picard, who nods back, expressionless. She moves	toward a seat next to Troi.					TROI				(sotto)			Where've you been?					BEVERLY				(likewise)			With a patient. Minor emergency.	Troi nods and then -- from the opposite door -- Odan	walks in.					PICARD			Ambassador Odan, this is Governor			Leka Trion, of Peliar Zel.					LEKA			Ambassador... thank you for			coming.				(beat)			I knew your father.					(MORE)       STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT ONE       7A.7    CONTINUED:					LEKA (Cont'd)			His efforts helped keep our			people at peace for several			generations.					ODAN			I would hope to serve you as well			as he.	Picard has gestured people to their seats; Odan finds	himself next to Data, who leans to him and says, in	an aside:        STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT ONE        8.7    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			I hope Doctor Crusher was able			to help you with your headache.					ODAN			Thank you. Actually, she was.	A little flicker between Odan and Beverly.					PICARD			Governor Leka has intercepted us			before we reached her planet in			order to update us on the			situation.					LEKA			It has grown progressively worse.			The people on our moons have been			in discord ever since they			migrated from the planet five			centuries ago. For us on the			planet... it is like having two			squabbling children. We try to			help settle their arguments			without taking sides... but this			time, we are at a loss.					ODAN			I've been studying the information			you sent... If I understand			correctly, the people of Alpha			moon have found a way to tap			directly into the magnetic field			of your planet, and now rely			exclusively on that energy			source.					LEKA			Yes. But the Beta moon seems to			be suffering some environmental			damage as a result.					DATA			My design models suggest that Beta			will begin to experience rising			temperatures... erratic tide			surges... and in general the			beginnings of global warming.        STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT ONE        9.7    CONTINUED: (3)					BEVERLY			The impact on the health of the			Betan people is clear. There			will be profound medical			repercussions.					LEKA			Alpha is unwilling to lose their			new-found energy source... Beta			accuses them of intentionally			courting genocide... our efforts			to find a compromise have failed.			And now --				(beat)			-- we've received intelligence			that both sides are arming for			war. If that happens... the			people of my planet will begin			to take sides... the outcome can			only be disastrous.					PICARD			We will be in orbit around Peliar			Zel within six hours. If you can			arrange for the representatives			of Alpha and Beta to be there,			Ambassador Odan can beam directly			to the planet.	Picard rises, indicating an end to the meeting.					ODAN			Excuse me, Captain... I would			prefer to shuttle to the surface.					LEKA			I would not recommend it. There			are many radical factions involved			in this dispute. It would be			difficult to guarantee your			safety.					ODAN				(good-natured)			I'm sure I'm not the first who			has expressed discomfort with the			idea of molecular transport.			Thank you, but I much prefer to			keep myself intact. I'll shuttle			down.       STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT ONE       10.7    CONTINUED: (4)					PICARD			As you like.	The group files out.8    ANGLE - TROI	quietly watching the room empty. Picard sees her,	approaches, curious.					PICARD			Counselor... ?					TROI			It's Ambassador Odan... I continue			to feel such... fluctuations...			of emotion from him.					PICARD				(dryly)			Maybe it's just spring, Deanna...				(off her look)			Or perhaps these sensations are			perfectly normal among the Trill.					TROI			It could be... we know so little			about them...	She shakes her head as though to rid it of a nagging	doubt.					TROI			But he seems a lovely person...			very much a gentleman, don't you			think?					PICARD			Yes. Quite.	Troi leaves and we stay on Picard.9    INT. BARBER SHOP - LATER (OPTICAL)	Our blue barber works on N.D. crew in the background.	Beverly reclines on a lounge, either hand draped in a	bowl of translucent liquid. Her feet are bare, toes	freshly painted, held apart by a special little drying	rack.       STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT ONE       11.9    CONTINUED:	A cloth of special astringent is folded across her	eyes. Troi ENTERS, spies her, goes to an adjacent	lounge. She speaks nonchalantly...					TROI			Is that the colgonite astringent			you have on your eyes? I've never			tried it...	Beverly starts a bit... lifts one corner of the	cloth... sees Troi looking at her innocently. Beverly	feels a little embarrassed to be found cosseting	herself.					BEVERLY			Yes... I mean, I guess it is...			someone just put it on me...					TROI			I never knew you even came in			here...					BEVERLY			I don't. I mean, not usually...					TROI			But sometimes it feels good just			to indulge yourself...					BEVERLY			I guess so...					TROI			Especially when you haven't done			so for a while...	Beverly pulls the cloth off, gives her a look. Is	there a double meaning here?					BEVERLY			What's that supposed to mean?					TROI			Beverly... you're in love.	Beverly is nonplussed. Is it that obvious?					BEVERLY			How... how did you know?       STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT ONE       12.9    CONTINUED: (2)					TROI				(gently)			I don't really think it's much			of a secret.					BEVERLY			It isn't?					TROI			No. You've been -- glowing.	Beverly gives her a look, then, realizing Troi is	absolutely right, she smiles... luxuriating in the	feelings.					BEVERLY			"Glowing... " Well, yeah... that's			just how I feel, Deanna...	She looks to Troi for approbation... but sees something	else... a doubt, a misgiving...					BEVERLY			What... ?					TROI			Nothing --					BEVERLY			Yes, there is, I can tell. What			is it?					TROI			Just... something I sense in Odan.					BEVERLY			What? What do you sense?					TROI			I'm not sure how to describe it...			and I'm not saying there's			anything wrong, it's just...				(beat)			Beverly... how well do you really			know him?					BEVERLY			I... I feel like I know him better			than anyone I've ever known...			but...       STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT ONE       13.9    CONTINUED: (3)	She sits up, her overwhelming feelings now tapped, and	pours out a litany of vacillation.					BEVERLY			Am I being foolish? I don't think			so... and yet... it's only been			a couple of weeks... Of course,			maybe that means it's just			infatuation... but I'm a grown			up, I know the difference between			love and infatuation...	Troi regards her with amused tolerance. She is happy	that her friend is re-capturing some long dormant	feelings. Surely that's more important than that	nagging sense that Odan isn't what he seems...					BEVERLY			But one thing I'm sure of... is			that I haven't felt like this in			a long time...					TROI			And you like it...	Beverly looks at her, smiles.					BEVERLY			I like it.	And Troi returns the smile. Love covers many	blemishes.10   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around a large planet; two moons are also in	evidence.11   INT.

I never			know until I am into the			situation... meet the people			involved. I work very much by			instinct, not by pre-arranged			plan.					PICARD			It seems to work well for you.					ODAN			I do like to go into a situation			as well informed as possible...			and your staff has been quite			helpful in briefing me on the			problems involved here.				(beat)			Particularly Doctor Crusher.					PICARD			My staff is quite capable. I'm			glad they've been useful.					ODAN			Your Doctor Beverly is an			extraordinary person... both as			a scientist... and as a woman.	Picard is becoming uncomfortable with the frank nature	of this discussion.					PICARD			I'm sure that's true. Well...			shall we make our way to the			Shuttlebay?					ODAN			Captain... you know her better			than I... do you have any idea			how -- committed -- she is to			remaining with Starfleet?	This catches Picard by surprise. Is Odan planning to	take Beverly off the Enterprise?       STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/8/91 - ACT ONE       15.11   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			I wouldn't presume to speak for			her.					ODAN			Of course not. I just thought...			you've known her for so long...	But before Picard can answer --					ENSIGN'S COM VOICE			Ensign Taggert to Captain			Picard...					PICARD			Yes, Ensign?					ENSIGN'S COM VOICE			The shuttle is ready to transport			the Ambassador.					PICARD			Very well.					ODAN			I can find my own way, Captain.				(beat)			I hope to bring good news when			I return.	And he is gone. Picard stares after him, discomfited	by this conversation.12   INT. SHUTTLEBAY	Odan moves with Geordi toward the shuttle, where Riker	and Beverly wait. Odan carries a small case.					GEORDI			Commander Riker asked to pilot			you himself, Ambassador.					ODAN			I am honored.	But his eyes are on Beverly, and he goes to her, takes	her aside from the others.					ODAN			I don't know when I'll be back...       STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT ONE       16.12   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			I know... have a safe trip.	He smiles warmly, puts his arms around her as though	it were the most natural thing in the world, even with	the crew nearby.					ODAN			I will stay safe, Doctor			Beverly...

It was your aunt			who represented Beta thirty years			ago...					LATHAL BINE			That is correct.					RIKER			A formidable woman.

Beverly completes	a final test, and then moves off to the side, out of	ear-shot, where Picard is waiting.					BEVERLY			All his vital functions are			overworked. His immune system			is under attack. I can only guess			that he's going through classic			rejection syndrome.					PICARD			Is there any treatment you can			give him?					BEVERLY			I can administer an			immunosuppressant. It would help			with the symptoms... but it			wouldn't correct the underlying			cause. He's carrying a foreign			organism in his body.	She runs a hand through her hair, tired and frustrated.					BEVERLY			I don't know what to do... medical			school didn't exactly prepare me			for a situation like this...					PICARD			You're doing all you can...	Beverly gives him a look, a rueful laugh.              STAR TREK: "The Host" - 3/1/91 - ACT FOUR             43.42   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Thank you. I wish that were more			comforting.	She takes a breath, shrugs off anguish.					BEVERLY			Don't worry about me, Captain.			I'm fine.	They lock eyes for a moment, each acknowledging the	lie. Picard turns to Riker.					PICARD			Ambassador... when you feel up			to it, please join me in my Ready			Room.	He EXITS. Beverly goes to Riker, takes a hypospray	from an instrument table.					BEVERLY			I'm giving you something that			should help you feel better. At			least temporarily.	Beverly administers the injection. Riker takes a few	deep breaths... seems to relax... the pain goes from	his eyes as he gets relief.					RIKER			The pain is gone... thank you...	Then he takes her wrist, holds it firmly. Beverly	feels a wave of heat rising in her.					BEVERLY			Please... don't...					RIKER			Let me touch you... just for a			moment...	For a brief moment, she allows herself to yield to the	feelings. She reaches out... touches his face...	caresses his cheek... starts to bend to him...	But she stops herself. This isn't right...

Then, forcing himself, he releases	her.43   INT. READY ROOM - A LITTLE LATER	Riker with Picard.					PICARD			It was a fast decision, which we			must take as positive. The Alphan			representative has agreed...			somewhat dubiously... to let you			mediate the dispute.					RIKER			I was sure they would. They are			reasonable people... just trapped			in their own anger.					PICARD			I have no doubt, however, that			they will bolt if anything goes			wrong in your discussions.					RIKER				(grinning)			Then it's up to me to make sure			nothing goes wrong.	Picard looks at him curiously; Riker is puzzled.					RIKER			Have I said something wrong... ?					PICARD			No... it's just... for a			moment... you sounded more like			Will Riker.	There is a brief, uncomfortable moment. Then Picard	goes on briskly.					PICARD			We have received word that your			new host will arrive in eighteen			hours. Will you be all right			until then?           STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/6/91 - ACT FOUR           45.43   CONTINUED:					RIKER			The medication which Doctor			Beverly gave me has helped. I			will find a way to keep going.	Picard hears the quaint phrasing of Odan's reference	to Beverly... it still makes him uneasy. They eye	each other.					RIKER			It is an awkward situation for			her. As you can imagine.					PICARD			Yes. Yes, I certainly can.				(beat)			And for you as well.	Riker looks at him sadly.					RIKER			My life has been spent... trying			to help others find solutions to			insoluble problems. And now...			I am confronted with one of my			own for which there is truly no			answer.	Whether for Beverly, for Riker, or for the thoughtful,	sensitive being who speaks through Riker's mouth --	Picard feels profound sorrow.44   INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS - THAT NIGHT (OPTICAL)	Beverly ENTERS, weary from the day's anxieties, wanting	to unwind. She stretches her arms as she walks across	the room, then drops her neck and rolls her head. She	goes to the replicator.					BEVERLY			Lemon tea...	The replicator provides the tea and Beverly takes it,	sipping as she moves to a comfortable chair. She sits.	On the end table by the chair is the single rose that	Odan gave her before taking the ill-fated shuttle.	She regards it for a moment, then bends to inhale the	still-heady aroma.           STAR TREK: "The Host" - REV. 3/7/91 - ACT FOUR           46.45   INT.

She looks	up... as though hearing something -- someone -- calling	out to her...47   INT. ODAN'S QUARTERS	Riker is up, pacing, unable to sit still. He goes to	the computer monitor, flips it on, stares at it,	switches it off again. He goes to his replicator.					RIKER			Can you make balso tonic?					COMPUTER VOICE			There is no formula on record.			Please supply a molecular			structure.					RIKER			Never mind.	Riker looks toward the door... takes a step toward	it... stops, turns back.

No more small talk. Beverly is all but	trembling... she must take one more step, just one,	toward him...					RIKER			Beverly... I want you...	She takes a breath, as though there is suddenly not	enough oxygen in the room...					RIKER			If you are going to leave... you			must go now...	One last beat... but she knows the answer.					BEVERLY			I'm not leaving.	And she flows into his arms.

Medical ethics never tackled this	problem...					BEVERLY			But how can you function? Conduct			the meeting?	He looks at her, gives a wan smile.					RIKER			I'll manage.	The look between them carries many messages... and	Picard is witness to them. There is an intimacy that	has never existed between these two before. He turns	away, feeling somehow an intruder.					PICARD			We will respect your wishes.					RIKER			Further... I will conduct the			mediation today... but at the end			of today, regardless of the			outcome... I must be removed from			Riker's body.
