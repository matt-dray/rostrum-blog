NACELLE CONTROL (OPTICAL)	as Riker and Worf ENTER from a Jefferies tube junction	and stop in their tracks at what they see -- their	faces are lit by INTERACTIVE LIGHT as they take in the	strange scene before them.	This control room is situated at the forward end of the	starboard nacelle. In addition to wall panels, there	is a free standing console with work stations on both	sides. There is an access DOOR in the back wall that	leads into the injector room.	A ladder leads to a catwalk above -- there is an	OBSERVATION WINDOW in the wall through which it is	possible to see into the injector room, and beyond	that, the nacelle tube itself. When the plasma stream	is on, as it is now, its fiery glow obscures these	structures.	A TRANSLUCENT MAINTENANCE DOOR can drop down to cover	the window -- but even then the intense light of the	plasma bleeds through.	Riker and Worf are startled upon entering the room	because a man is standing on the catwalk, poised to	jump through the forecefield and into the plasma.   STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/20/93 - TEASER   3.7    CONTINUED: (2)	He is LIEUTENANT KWAN, a humanoid in his mid-thirties --	part Asian, part Napean. He is clearly agitated and	distraught.	Riker turns to LIEUTENANT NARA, who along with an N.D,	is standing motionless, unsure what to do. She is	humanoid, in her mid-thirties.					RIKER				(quiet)			What happened?					NARA				(quiet)			He locked out the controls...			before we knew what was happening,			he stepped up onto the walkway.	Riker gestures for Worf to go to a console.					RIKER			See if you can shut down the			plasma flow.	Worf acknowledges and moves away.					NARA			I'm afraid if we try to get any			closer, he'll jump through the			forecefield.	Riker acknowledges, turns to Kwan.					RIKER			Dan...8    ON KWAN	facing the plasma stream, his face lit by its glow --	Riker can be seen behind him. Riker takes a cautious	step toward him.					RIKER			It's me...

When he speaks, it is in	the tones of a man confessing a wretched crime.					KWAN			I didn't... want to do it...			but... I saw them... and... they			laughed at me... they laughed...	Kwan is clearly in agony about this... though Riker has	no idea what he's talking about, he knows he needs to	try and calm him down.					RIKER			Whatever happened, we can talk			about it. I want to help.	Riker starts to climb the ladder to the catwalk.					KWAN			Stay away!	Riker stops --					RIKER			I want you to be able to see me,			that's all... so we can talk.					KWAN			I... know... what I have to do...	He takes a half-step toward the plasma stream.					RIKER			Dan, wait --9    ON WORF AND NARA	at the console, working to free the controls.					WORF			I have unlocked the controls --					COMPUTER VOICE			Shut down procedure initiated.					NARA			There's still plasma in the			injector -- it'll take time to			vent off...   STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/20/93 - TEASER   5.10   RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)	Riker has taken note of the fact that the plasma stream	will soon dissipate -- he knows he needs to keep Kwan	from jumping until it does.					RIKER			Tell me what happened. Maybe I			can help.	But Kwan is staring intently into the stream, seems	strangely calmed by it.					KWAN			I know what I have to do...	Riker senses what he's about to do and makes a sudden	move toward him... but it's too late... Kwan has	already started to move... Riker misses him by half a	step and Kwan jumps through the FORCEFIELD and into the	stream -- he is instantly VAPORIZED.	Riker stops in mid-stride -- so close.

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it hangs in space.12   INT. READY ROOM	Riker and Worf are reporting what happened to Picard	and TROI.					RIKER			A few more seconds and we could've			saved his life...	Riker clearly feels that he should have been able to	talk Kwan down.					WORF			Commander... you did everything			you could. It was not your fault.	Riker acknowledges, but can't quite shake the feeling.					RIKER			I had the strangest feeling			that... he didn't even recognize			me -- and I was with him just the			other day when I supervised the			tube refit.					PICARD			How did he seem then?					RIKER			Fine. In fact I complimented him			for getting the refit done faster			than expected. He was pleased			that I noticed.					TROI			I met with him during crew			evaluations about six weeks ago.			He was very positive; he was			looking forward to being posted to			the nacelle tube.  STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/21/93 - ACT ONE  7.12   CONTINUED:					RIKER			He was a fine officer, with a good			career ahead of him. I just don't			understand why he would want to...	Riker trails off, shakes his head.					PICARD			In my years as a Starship Captain,			I've had to notify many families			that they'd lost a loved one. But			never to suicide. I'd like to be			able to offer Lieutenant Kwan's			family some explanation for what			happened -- to help them make			sense of it.					WORF			He may have left a message of some			kind, explaining why he did it.	Picard acknowledges this possibility.					PICARD				(to Troi and Worf)			I want the two of you to try and			piece together a picture of his			last few days.	Troi and Worf acknowledge.					TROI			If he made any personal logs, it			might be helpful to go through			them.					PICARD			You're authorized to do so.	A Com signal SOUNDS.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			La Forge to Captain.					PICARD			Go ahead.13   INT. ENGINEERING	where Geordi is working at a console.  STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE  8.13   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			I've completed a damage			assessment. We should be able to			get underway within the hour.14   INT. READY ROOM					PICARD			Geordi, the medical situation on			Barson Two has worsened --			Starfleet has given us permission			to exceed warp speed limitations			so we can get back on schedule.15   INT. ENGINEERING					GEORDI			We'll be able to give you warp			eight if you need it.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Acknowledged.	Geordi returns to work. After a moment, Data	approaches him.					DATA			Geordi, would you agree that the			instinct for self-preservation is			shared by most life forms?					GEORDI			I'd say it's probably the most			basic instinct.					DATA			That being the case, I am having			difficulty understanding why			someone would deliberately			terminate their own existence.     STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE  9.15   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			I don't know, Data. All I can			think is that maybe Lieutenant			Kwan felt like there was			something... wrong in his life,			something he felt powerless to			fix.	Data takes this in.					DATA			I believe I understand. I have			been in a similar situation.	Geordi's a little surprised to hear this.					GEORDI			Really?					DATA			The first months following my			activation were a difficult period			for me... there were many			problems associated with my			becoming sentient.					GEORDI			Because your neural net was still			forming.					DATA			As I acquired new skills, neural			pathways would form and take the			place of other, less complex			pathways. It was very...			disorienting.					GEORDI			Sure sounds like it.					DATA			As my systems grew in complexity,			it became increasingly difficult			to integrate new pathways into my			existing neural net. The			probability of cascade failure			grew with each added pathway. I			came to the conclusion that it			would be easier and safer to shut			myself down and start again.					GEORDI			But if you did that, you wouldn't			have remembered any of the things			that had happened to you.    STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" 12/20/93 - ACT ONE    10.15   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			In a way, it would have been			like... committing suicide.	Geordi acknowledges Data's point.					GEORDI			So what did you do?					DATA			I decided against the procedure.			I chose instead to treat the			problems I was having with my			systems as... challenges to be			overcome, instead of obstacles to			be avoided.	Geordi studies his friend's face for a beat; once	again, Data has shown facets of himself no one knew he	had.					GEORDI			That's a great way of looking at			it. It's too bad Lieutenant Kwan			wasn't able to look at his			problems the same way.	Data acknowledges his sentiment, and after a beat, they	return to work...16   INT. CORRIDOR	as Worf and Troi make their way down it.					TROI			I've gone over Kwan's personnel			records -- he had an exceptionally			stable psychological profile.					WORF			When we were in the control room,			it seemed as if he were trying			to... explain something he'd			done... something terrible.					TROI			He'd been on the Enterprise over			two years. No one has ever			reported an altercation with him.	Worf acknowledges and gestures to a DOOR along the	corridor.  STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE  11.16   CONTINUED:					WORF				(continuing)			These were his quarters.	He works a KEYPAD on the wall and the door OPENS.17   INT. KWAN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	These are the smaller, windowless quarters. There are	CHINESE and ALIEN ARTIFACTS in evidence, reflecting	Kwan's mixed heritage. Everything is neat and orderly.	Troi and Worf step inside... they stand silently for a	moment, almost out of respect for the dead. After a	beat, Worf moves to a nearby table and picks up an	ALIEN looking ARTIFACT.					WORF			This is a Napean design...					TROI			His mother is Napean; his father's			human.	He studies the artifact for a beat, then sets it down.	Troi looks around the room.					TROI				(continuing)			Everything looks so... normal.			For some reason I was half			expecting to find the place a			mess.					WORF			Yes... it is strange to think that			someone could be considering			ending his life and yet not give			any outward sign of it.	They continue moving around the room, looking for	something that might provide a clue.					WORF				(continuing)			Right before he jumped, he seemed			almost... calm. STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE 11A.17   CONTINUED:					TROI			He must have been in a lot of pain			to do what he did. It could be			that the prospect of ending that			pain felt like a great relief.  STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE  12.17   CONTINUED: (2)	Worf moves to look at something on the wall. Troi	finds a PHOTOGRAPH of a young woman, a pretty human of	about thirty. She turns to show it to Worf just as he	turns away from the wall, so that they almost bump into	one another -- there's a moment where they're standing	very close, then Troi shows Worf the photograph.					TROI			This is Ensign... Calloway, isn't			it?	Worf looks at the photo, acknowledges.					WORF			She is a medical technician in			Sickbay.	Troi's face registers sympathy for Calloway.					TROI			It's always hard to lose someone			you care about... but to lose them			like this...	They study the picture for a beat, then she sets it	down.					WORF			We should start going over his			logs...	They move to a DESKTOP COMPUTER TERMINAL -- Troi sits	and activates it, Worf leans in to look.					TROI			This is his last entry; he made it			before going on duty this morning.	Kwan's face appears on the MONITOR.					KWAN			Personal log, Stardate 47622.1.			We finally finished the nacelle			tube refit last night. After			pulling two double shifts in a			row, I'm really looking forward to			spending some time with Maddy.					TROI			Ensign Calloway...	Worf and Troi are struck by how upbeat Kwan seems, and	puzzled that he seemed to be making plans.  STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE  13.17   CONTINUED: (3)					TROI				(continuing)			That doesn't sound like a man			planning on ending his life.					WORF			No... it does not...	Off the mystery of the moment...18   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it travels at warp.19   INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE	as Troi and CALLOWAY ENTER from Sickbay so they can	talk in private. The young woman is clearly destroyed	by what's happened.					CALLOWAY			I can't believe he's really			gone... I keep thinking he's			going to show up and tell me			there's been some terrible			misunderstanding...	Troi's tone is gentle, caring -- she's both	investigating Kwan's death and counseling a bereaved	crewmember.					TROI			I thought you might like to know			that in his personal logs, Dan			talked about you a great deal. He			loved you very much.					CALLOWAY			If that's true... then how could			he... leave me like this?	Troi puts a comforting hand to her shoulder.					TROI			That's what I'm trying to find			out. I know it's hard to talk			about right now... but it would be			very helpful if you could tell me			a few things about him.	Calloway acknowledges, pulls herself together.    STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" 12/20/93 - ACT ONE    14.19   CONTINUED:					TROI				(continuing)			When was the last time you saw			him?					CALLOWAY			Two nights ago... we were planning			our next shore leave together.					TROI			Did he mention anything that			happened recently... anything that			might have upset him?					CALLOWAY			No, not really... he did say			something about work, about			Lieutenant Nara, but it wasn't			anything serious.					TROI			Nara... she's his superior officer			in the nacelle tube.					CALLOWAY			Yes. Dan sensed that she... well,			that she felt threatened by him --			that she thought he was after her			position.	Troi take this in.					TROI			Was he prone to mood swings, or			depression?					CALLOWAY			No... but he was very sensitive to			other people's moods.					TROI			What do you mean?					CALLOWAY			Sometimes he would just... look at			me, and know what I was feeling --			I always loved that about him.					TROI			Napeans are partially empathic --			he may have inherited some of his			mother's abilities.    STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" 12/20/93 - ACT ONE    15.19   CONTINUED: (2)					CALLOWAY				(smiles)			He used to tease me that when I			met her, I wouldn't be able to get			away with anything.	Calloway is thoughtful for a moment.					CALLOWAY				(continuing)			Dan and I knew each other for over			two years, but we didn't really			get together until a few months			ago. We took it slow...	Her face falters a little....					CALLOWAY				(continuing)			We thought we had all the time in			the world...	Troi is struck by the depth of feeling in her words.	Calloway turns to her, suddenly determined.					CALLOWAY				(continuing)			Something must've happened to him,			Counselor. Something terrible			Because it's not like Dan to take			his own life. Please... find out			what it was.	Troi takes Calloway's plea to heart. Off her face,	more determined than ever...20   INT. JEFFERIES TUBE	as Troi climbs the ladder toward the nacelle tube.21   INT. NACELLE CONTROL	as she ENTERS from a Jefferies tube junction. No one	is there, and the room is bathed by an eerie GLOW that	emanates from the maintenance DOOR (which is DOWN, in	position).  STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE  16.21   CONTINUED:	Troi takes a look around the room, starts her way down	its length. It is clear from her face that she finds	the whole setting a little spooky -- the strange light,	the dissonant HUM of the plasma stream, the fact that	a man died here...	She continues her slow walk down the length of the	room... as she passes a FREE-STANDING CONSOLE, a FIGURE	suddenly emerges from behind it. Troi is startled,	steps back...					NARA			I'm sorry --	Troi recovers --					TROI			I didn't see you there...	They share a smile over this little incident.	Lieutenant Nara is holding a TOOL she was working on	the console with.					TROI				(continuing)			You're Lieutenant Nara, aren't			you?	Nara acknowledges.					NARA			Can I do something for you,			Counselor?					TROI			I'm investigating Lieutenant			Kwan's death. I just wanted to			take a look around.					NARA			It's such a shame. He was a good			man.	Troi senses Nara is sincere about this.					TROI			Did you notice any change in his			behavior recently?					NARA			No... I've been going over the			last few days in my mind, trying			to see if I missed any... warning			signs. It's as if something in			him just... snapped.  STAR TREK: "Eye of the Beholder" REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE  17.21   CONTINUED: (3)					TROI			How was his job performance?					NARA			Excellent. He knew this ship			better than most people --			probably because he helped build			it back at Utopia Planitia.					TROI			Did he get along with his coworkers?	Nara considers for a beat.					NARA			He was... ambitious. He came in			here with all sorts of new ideas			about how to do things -- some of			them very good ideas.					TROI			But not all?					NARA				(smiles)			No. But once he settled in, we			got along fine.	An N.D. ENTERS and Nara gestures that she'll be right	there.					NARA				(continuing)			Excuse me for a minute. Feel free			to look around.					TROI			Where was Lieutenant Kwan's			station?					NARA			Right down there.	Nara indicates a console at the far end of the room.	Troi acknowledges and Nara crosses away, EXITS with the	N.D.

She's wearing an	Engineering jumpsuit, and appears to be in her	thirties.	Though we don't see Troi, the POV would indicate that	she's standing in another part of the control room --	not the catwalk where we just saw her.

Troi recognizes the woman -- the same	terrified face she saw before.	They regard Troi for a beat, then suddenly the man	stifles a laugh.
