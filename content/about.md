# Us

### Adriana De Palma

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/adpalma) | [academia.edu]((https://nhm.academia.edu/AdrianaDePalma)) | [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=DhrCDz8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) | [NHM](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/adriana-de%20palma.html)

I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/), London. I have a PhD in Ecology and an MRes in Entomology from Imperial College London, and a BSc in Biology from the University of Sussex.

In terms of my research, I am particularly interested in using large scale ecological datasets to answer policy relevant questions. I work on the [PREDICTS project](http://www.predicts.org.uk/) with [Andy Purvis](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/andy-purvis.html), looking at how biodiversity responds over time to land-use change and related pressures. My more general interests lie with science policy, statistics and weird and wonderful invertebrates (my favourite being [Collembola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springtail) – the beautiful springtails).

I like data analysis and ecology. I currently work as an analyst ('data scientist') and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) evangelist in the public sector. I have a PhD in the effects of environmental change on plant litter decay from Cardiff University and an Entomology MSc from Imperial College London. I'm not [the rapper](https://www.drdre.com/). Nor the [gynaecologist](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44043205).

# The site

### What's a *rostrum*?

The mouthparts of insects in the order [Hemiptera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiptera) (true bugs). But also a [speaker's platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostra). *Do you see what we did there?*

### Doesn't this already exist?

Sort-of. This was originally a [Wordpress blog](https://therostrumblog.wordpress.com/). We might migrate those posts at some point.

# Design

### Construction

The site was generated with the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package from the mighty [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/).

We used the Hugo Lithium Theme forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme).

The site is hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Logo and favicon

Logo designed by Matt using [pixlr](https://pixlr.com) online image editor. Favicon created with [favicon.cc](https://www.favicon.cc/) (the antennae in the favicon will wiggle if your browser allows it).
