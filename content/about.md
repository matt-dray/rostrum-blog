## tl;dr

A record of interesting or fun things we've learnt using [R](https://www.r-project.org/). It's a bonus if you find it useful and/or amusing.

## Us

### Matt Dray

I like using R to learn and teach, particularly if it involves important pop-culture references like Pokemon and Dawson's Creek. I'm a data scientist in the public sector (my views belong to me and no-one else). I have a PhD in the effects of environmental change on plant litter decay ('watching leaves rot') from Cardiff University and an Entomology MSc from Imperial College London. I'm not [the rapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre).

### Adriana De Palma

Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/), London. I have a PhD in Ecology and an MRes in Entomology from Imperial College London, and a BSc in Biology from the University of Sussex.

In terms of my research, I am particularly interested in using large scale ecological datasets to answer policy relevant questions. I work on the [PREDICTS project](http://www.predicts.org.uk/) with [Andy Purvis](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/andy-purvis.html), looking at how biodiversity responds over time to land-use change and related pressures. My more general interests lie with science policy, statistics and weird and wonderful invertebrates (my favourite being [Collembola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springtail) -- the beautiful springtails).

## Miscellania

### What's a *rostrum*?

The mouthparts of insects in the order [Hemiptera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiptera) (true bugs). But also a [speaker's platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostra). *Do you see what we did there?*

### Doesn't this already exist?

Sort-of. This was originally a [Wordpress blog](https://therostrumblog.wordpress.com/). We might migrate those posts at some point.

### More R content
