I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/), London. I have a PhD in Ecology and an MRes in Entomology from Imperial College London, and a BSc in Biology from the University of Sussex.

In terms of my research, I am particularly interested in using large scale ecological datasets to answer policy relevant questions. I work on the [PREDICTS project](http://www.predicts.org.uk/) with [Andy Purvis](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/andy-purvis.html), looking at how biodiversity responds over time to land-use change and related pressures. My more general interests lie with science policy, statistics and weird and wonderful invertebrates (my favourite being [Collembola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springtail) – the beautiful springtails).

I like data analysis and ecology. I currently work as an analyst ('data scientist') and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) evangelist in the public sector. I have a PhD in the effects of environmental change on plant litter decay from Cardiff University and an Entomology MSc from Imperial College London. I'm not [the rapper](https://www.drdre.com/).

# The site

### What's a *rostrum*?

The mouthparts of insects in the order [Hemiptera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiptera) (true bugs). But also a [speaker's platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostra). *Do you see what we did there?*
