## tl;dr

Fun and learning with the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) for programming and statistics. It's a bonus if you find any of it useful and/or amusing. All views belong to us.

Check out [R Weekly](https://rweekly.org/) for more R blog content.

I like using R to learn and teach, particularly if it involves important pop-culture references like Pokémon and Dawson's Creek. I'm a datapoint influencer in the UK's public sector and have a PhD in watching leaves rot (Cardiff) and an Entomology MSc (Imperial). I'm not [the rapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre). <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/postcard/master/favicon.ico" alt="A 16-by-16 pixel favicon gif of the author, whose eyebrows are bobbing up and down."/>

I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/), London. I have a PhD in Ecology and an MRes in Entomology from Imperial College London, and a BSc in Biology from the University of Sussex.

In terms of my research, I am particularly interested in using large scale ecological datasets to answer policy relevant questions. I work on the [PREDICTS project](http://www.predicts.org.uk/) with [Andy Purvis](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/andy-purvis.html), looking at how biodiversity responds over time to land-use change and related pressures. My more general interests lie with science policy, statistics and weird and wonderful invertebrates (my favourite being [Collembola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springtail) -- the beautiful springtails).
