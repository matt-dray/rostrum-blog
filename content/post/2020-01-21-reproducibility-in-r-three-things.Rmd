# Reproducevangelism

I spoke at the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education){target='_blank'}'s Data Science Week. I wanted everyone -- newer and more experienced users alike -- to learn at least one new thing about reproduciblity with R and RStudio.

The slides are embedded below and you can also [get them fullscreen online](https://matt-dray.github.io/reproducibility-ds-week/#1){target='_blank'} (press 'F' for fullscreen and 'P' for presenter notes) and find [the source on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/reproducibility-ds-week){target='_blank'}.

# Three things

The three things to achieve reproducibility were very broad. I focused on R and some specific packages that could be helpful, but the ideas are transferable and there's lots of ways to achieve the same thing.

The things were:

## 1. Centralise everything

Get code, functions, data, documentation in one place. Use [R Projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) in RStudio and [write packages](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/usethis-workflow-for-package-development/). This makes code more shareable and improves the chance that others can recreate things on their machine.

## 2. Report with code

Put code inside your report so that updates to data and code will be reflected instantly. Use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and other formats like Yihui Xie's [{xaringan}](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1) for reproducible slides and [{bookdown}](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) by for reproducible books.

## 3. Manage workflows

Don't use your brain to store information about the dependencies within your analysis. Use [{drake}](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/) by Will Landau instead. It remembers all the relationships between the files, objects and fcuntions in your analysis and only re-runs what needs to be re-run following changes.
