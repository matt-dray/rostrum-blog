# Reproducevangelism

I spoke at the [Department for Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education){target='_blank'}'s Data Science Week.

The talk targets R users at different stages of their reproducibility journey:

* Step 1 -- get code, data and documentation in the same place
* Step 2 -- make output reports reproducible
* Step 3 -- make entire workflows reproducible

The slides are embedded below and you can also [get them fullscreen online](https://matt-dray.github.io/reproducibility-ds-week/#1){target='_blank'} and find [the source on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/reproducibility-ds-week){target='_blank'}.

# Three things

I spoke about three very broad things to achieve reproducibility:

1. Centralise everything
1. Report with code
1. Manage workflows

The focus was on R, but the ideas are transferable.

## 1. Centralise everything

Get code, functions, data, documentation in one place. Use R Projects in RStudio and write packages.

## 2. Report with code

Put code inside your report so that updates to data and code will be reflected instantly. Use R Markdown.

## 3. Manage workflows

Don't use your brain to store information about the dependencies within your analysis. Use {drake} instead.

# Acknowledgements

I keep referring to the same resources about reproducibility. Take a look at:

* [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/){target='_blank'} (RAP), a UK government initiative to make publications more reproducible
* [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction){target='_blank'}, a book about reproducibility from [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/){target='_blank'}
* [Putting the R into reproducible research](https://annakrystalli.me/talks/r-in-repro-research-dc.html#1){target='_blank'}, some excellent and comprehensive slides by [Anna Krystalli](http://www.annakrystalli.com/){target='_blank'}
