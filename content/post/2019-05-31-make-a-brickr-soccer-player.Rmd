# Virtual Lego

[{brickr}](https://github.com/ryantimpe/brickr) is a fun package by [Ryan Timpe](http://www.ryantimpe.com/) that lets you build 2D mosaics and 3D models with Lego-like virtual bricks,[^timpe] with a little help from [Tyler Morgan Wall](https://www.tylermw.com/)'s [{rayshader}](https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayshader) package.

# Kick-off

I've written a function called `create_brickr_player()` that lets you build a soccer player and select the brick colours for the shirt, socks, and much more.

It lets you create the same model but change the brick colours with minimum fuss. 

The (completely untested) function lives in my package of misc functions, [{dray}](https://matt-dray.github.io/dray/), which can be installed from GitHub. 

```{r message=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(dray)  # remotes::install_github("matt-dray/dray")
library(brickr)  # install.packages("brickr")
library(dplyr)  # install.packages("dplyr")
```

The function is simple. It helps you create a data frame that specifies the location and colour of individual bricks on successive 2D planes to build up a 3D model.

This data frame is a plan that can be interpreted by {brickr} and transformed into a special list that can be rendered in 3D space.

Here's what happens when you use the function with default arguments. 

```{r}
player_plan <- create_brickr_player()
player_plan  # preview the object
```

Each layer of bricks gets a separate value in the `Level` column. 

The x-dimension is represented by the rows of the data frame and the y-dimension by the numbered columns.

Every non-zero number represents a brick and each value represents a different colour. 

For example, layer A has dimensions of 3 x 5 where 4 spots will be filled with a brick. Each of these has the value '2', which encodes the colour black. Layer B, meanwhile, has a couple of bricks with value '7', which is bright red.

How do you know which numbers encode which colours? You can access the codes from the `lego_colors` data frame in the {brickr} package.

```{r}
select(lego_colors, brickrID, Color, hex)  # colour codes
```

<details><summary>Click for full brick colour codes</summary>
```{r echo=FALSE}
lego_colors %>% 
  mutate(
    hex = cell_spec(hex, "html", background = factor(brickrID, lego_colors$brickrID, lego_colors$hex))
  ) %>% 
  select(`Colour ID` = brickrID, Colour = Color, `Hex code` = hex) %>% 
  kable(format = "html", escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```
</details>

So '1' is white, '2' is black and so on. I think Timpe selected this set of colours to match the colours available from Lego sets. 

## Boring, boring Arsenal

To actually build the model, pass the data frame to a couple of {brickr} functions.

The first is `bricks_from_table()` that converts the data frame to a list containing several elements that define the required bricks and colours. 

```{r}
# Convert plan to list with brick types and colours
player_bricks <- player_plan %>%
  bricks_from_table()

names(player_bricks)  # see the element names
```

As a side note, you can use `display_pieces()` to find out the set of pieces you'll need to recreate the model in real life!

```{r}
display_pieces(player_bricks)
```

Pass the list object to the `display_bricks()` function to get the plan rendered into 3D. This opens a new device window and the model will be built up layer by layer. When complete, you can use your mouse to click and drag the object to look at at from all directions.

```{r eval=FALSE}
display_bricks(player_bricks)  # opens separate window
```

So the default set builds up to make a player that has red socks with white trim, white shorts, and a red shirt with white sleeves. An Arsenal player, of course.[^arsenal]

## Show your support

To change the colour of the player's shirt you just need to change all the bricks associated with the shirt. This could be tedious by hand, so `create_brickr_player()` has an argument to do exactly this. Set `shirt_body_col` to '6' to make it bright blue, for example.

You can change more than the shirt colour. Here's the current set of arguments:

* `shirt_body_col` and `shirt_sleeve_col`
* `shorts_col`
* `sock_col` and `sock_trim_col`
* `boot_col`
* `hair_col` and `skin_col`

So you could create a Manchester City player with the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Build player plan with certain colours
man_city <- create_brickr_player(
  hair_col = 2,           # Black
  skin_col = 39,          # Dark brown
  boot_col = 7,           # Bright red
  shirt_body_col = 13,    # Light royal blue
  shirt_sleeve_col = 13,  # Light royal blue
  shorts_col = 1,         # White
  sock_col = 27,          # Earth blue
  sock_trim_col = 27      # Earth blue
)

# Convert plan to list and render it
man_city %>%
  bricks_from_table() %>%
  display_bricks()
```

In fact, this is a faithful rendering of the 2019 Premier League winner, FA Cup winner, League Cup winner, PFA Team of the Year inductee, PFA Young Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year [Raheem Sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling). Obviously.

I've added a couple more to [a GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/matt-dray/b075e1f2cb5da93a656b6e6e70990c44). Feel free to add more.

# Extra-time

Hopefully this is useful for anyone who wants to create the same {brickr} model in multiple colours. I realise that might be a niche audience.

The obvious next step would be to allow for features of the plan to change. For example, you could set an argument for `player_height` and add or remove layers from the plan to make the final model taller or shorter. Or maybe different shirt types could be specified, like `horizontal_stripe = TRUE`.

Pull requests always welcome!

[^timpe]: Not an official product (yet).
[^arsenal]: Why Arsenal? Mostly to demonstrate that sleeves can be a different colour to the shirt body, but also because [they just got binned 4-1 by Chelsea in the Europa League final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_UEFA_Europa_League_Final) and I feel sorry for them.
