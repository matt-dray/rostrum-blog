<h1>EARL 2018</h1>
<p>I gave a talk called <a href="https://earlconf.com/2018/london/#matt-dray"><em>Crosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny</em></a><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> at the <a href="https://earlconf.com/2018/london/">EARL 2018 conference in London</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/">The <code>crosstalk</code> package</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jcheng?lang=en">Joe Cheng</a> allows <a href="https://www.htmlwidgets.org/">HTML widgets</a> – JavaScript visualisations wrapped in R code – to interact with each other. This can be done inside an <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> document (including <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">Flexdashboard</a>) for easy server-less sharing in HTML format.</p>

<h1>Crosstalk in action</h1>
<p>Below is a very simple example from <a href="http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/using.html">the Crosstalk documentation site</a>. Click and drag to highlight points in the interactive plot (<code>d3scatter</code> package) and ‘brush’ the map markers (button in upper left) on the interactive map (<code>leaflet</code> package) and see how selections in each impact each other. Without Crosstalk, selections in one of these widgets <em>would not</em> impact the others.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/209203_02f14fea3274448bbbf8d04c99c6051b.html">a more advanced example of Crosstalk in action using Gapminder data</a>. It links HTML widgets from three packages – <code>leaflet</code>, <code>d3scatter</code> and <code>DT</code> – and includes a couple of sliders for filtering. All of this in less than 80 lines of code.</p>
<p>Remember all this is happening <em>in the browser</em> and <em>without Shiny</em>. And all you need to do is give each of your widgets a ‘shared data’ object. So instead of this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/some_data.RDS&quot;)  # get data
datatable(data)  # interactive table
leaflet(data) %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% addMarkers()  # map</code></pre>
<p>We can just add one extra line to create the shared data object and pass that to our widgets instead:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/some_data.RDS&quot;)
shared &lt;- SharedData$new(data)  # just add this line
datatable(shared)  # now refer to the shared data object
leaflet(shared) %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% addMarkers()</code></pre>

<p>My task: I had to create an app for our users – policy makers – to explore schools data to inform a funding programme. My problem: I didn’t have a server for hosting such an app. In other words, <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> wasn’t really feasible in this case.</p>

<div id="memestravaganza" class="section level1">
<h1>Memestravaganza</h1>
<p>Since it’s 2018, the only way to publicise such a presentation is to exploit the power of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes">memes</a> and social media; the only method for communicating with <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/05/22/avocado-latte-may-just-what-hipster-millennials-dreamed-maybe-not/102002538/">millenials</a> and <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/078/youngling.jpg">younglings</a> these days.</p>
<p>But why stop at one meme? Why not a <em>meme advent calendar</em> counting down the week in advance of the conference?<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>I’ve reproduced them here with a bit more context. If you’re on mobile you’ll see the rendered tweets. If on desktop you might not see them in certain browsers, but <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/blob/master/memes/links.md">you can access them from the GitHub repo</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<div id="day-one" class="section level2">
<h2>Day one</h2>
{{% tweet "1037226196797415425" %}}
<p>Yeah, so I figured that Shiny was the only way to make interactive apps. But I had a problem: no server access for hosting the app. Crosstalk is worth considering in this instance because you can share outputs as HTML files, which will open in the user’s browser.</p>
</div>
<div id="day-two" class="section level2">
<h2>Day two</h2>

<p>R users can probably recognise an interactive app made with Shiny<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Probably a <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">Flexdashboard</a> is easy to recognise too; these are typically used for non-interactive dashboard displays, but Crosstalk can be used to blur this line by making the elements interact with each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="day-three" class="section level2">
<h2>Day three</h2>
{{% tweet "1037951262766055424" %}}
<p>Self-explanatory, really. A small app can be made using Crosstalk and shared freely. Try it!</p>
</div>
<div id="day-four" class="section level2">
<h2>Day four</h2>
{{% tweet "1038306444045639680" %}}
<p>It’s 2018. You’ve got to exploit Trump for personal gain at some point. One potential drawback of Shiny is the need to host the app on a server. Not ideal if you don’t have acces to one. This is not a problem with Crosstalk-enabled tools, which you can share as HTML files.</p>
</div>
<div id="day-five" class="section level2">
<h2>Day five</h2>
{{% tweet "1038727929998598145" %}}
<p>Yeah, so there’s a false equivalency here. Crosstalk doesn’t necessarily help provide a direct replacement for Shiny. You still need Shiny to make ‘proper’ apps. But hey, the picture that the little girl has drawn still looks like a cat, right?</p>
<p>Since everything is rendered in-browser, you’re limited by your browser’s power. This means that the number of points on your interactive map, for example, is limited. In practice it’s maybe a couple of hundred. You can get around this by controlling point layers that can be switched on and off so fewer points are rendered at any one point But that’s a pain.</p>
</div>
<div id="day-six" class="section level2">
<h2>Day six</h2>
{{% tweet "1039034098214416384" %}}
<p>Let’s say you’ve read your data into the object <code>data</code>. Ordinarily you would do <code>leaflet::leaflet(data)</code>, <code>DT::datatable(data)</code>, etc, to create HTML widgets containing the data. To get the widgets to talk to each other with Crosstalk, you make a <em>shared data</em> object: <code>shared &lt;- SharedData$new(data)</code>. Now you can do <code>leaflet::leaflet(shared)</code>, <code>DT::datatable(shared)</code>, etc, to get widget interactivity. Only one extra line of code is needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="day-seven" class="section level2">
<h2>Day seven</h2>

<p>Turns out I punked you: my talk is called ‘Crosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny’ but <a href="http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/shiny.html">you can actually put Shiny in your Crosstalk</a>. Why? Your brushing and filtering with Crosstalk can be used to generate Shiny outputs and vice versa. For simplicity, my talk focuses only on Crosstalk.</p>

<h2>Bonus memes</h2>
<p>All the memes are available as JPEG files in <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/tree/master/memes">my earl18-presentation GitHub repository</a>. There’s also some extra ones in there.</p>
