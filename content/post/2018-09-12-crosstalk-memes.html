<h1>EARL 2018</h1>
<p><a href="https://earlconf.com/2018/london/">EARL 2018</a> is a conference for solving business problems with R.</p>
<p><a href="https://earlconf.com/2018/london/#matt-dray">I’m speaking there</a> about <a href="http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/">the Crosstalk package</a> for <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">the R programming language</a>.</p>
<p>Crosstalk allows <a href="https://www.htmlwidgets.org/">HTML widgets</a> – lovely JavaScript visuals acessible in R – to interact with each other. This means that selecting points in a table will update points in a map, for example. This replicates some functions of <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">the Shiny package</a> – a popular R tool for interactive apps – <em>without</em> the need for a server or knowledge of how to program Shiny apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/earl18-presentation/#1">My talk</a> describes how I helped policy makers explore schools data by creating a self-service tool incrementally with the <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R-Markdown</a>-powered package <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">Flexdashboard</a> and Crosstalk for interactivity between the HTML widgets for interactive maps (<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">Leaflet</a>) and tables (<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/">DT</a>).</p>

<h1>Memestravaganza</h1>
<p>Since it’s 2018, the only way to publicise such a presentation is to exploit the power of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes">memes</a> and social media; the only method for communicating with <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/05/22/avocado-latte-may-just-what-hipster-millennials-dreamed-maybe-not/102002538/">millenials</a> and <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/078/youngling.jpg">younglings</a> these days.</p>
<p>But why stop at one meme? Why not a <em>meme advent calendar</em> counting down the week in advance of the conference?<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I’ve reproduced them here with a bit more context. If you’re on mobile you’ll see the rendered tweets. If on desktop, you’ll need to click the &lt;pic.twitter.com&gt; links in each one.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Yeah, so I figured that Shiny was the only way to make interactive apps. But I had a problem: no server access for hosting the app. Crosstalk is worth considering in this instance because you can share outputs as HTML files, which will open in the user’s browser.</p>

<p>R users can probably recognise an interactive app made with Shiny<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Probably a <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">Flexdashboard</a> is easy to recognise too; these are typically used for non-interactive dashboard displays, but Crosstalk can be used to blur this line by making the elements interact with each other.</p>

<h2>Day three</h2>

<p>Self-explanatory, really. A small app can be made using Crosstalk and shared freely. Try it!</p>

<p>It’s 2018. You’ve got to exploit Trump for personal gain at some point. One potential drawback of Shiny is the need to host the app on a server. Not ideal if you don’t have acces to one. This is not a problem with Crosstalk-enabled tools, which you can share as HTML files.</p>

<p>Yeah, so there’s a false equivalency here. Crosstalk doesn’t necessarily help provide a direct replacement for Shiny. You still need Shiny to make ‘proper’ apps. But hey, the picture that the little girl has drawn still looks like a cat, right?</p>
<p>Since everything is rendered in-browser, you’re limited by your browser’s power. This means that the number of points on your interactive map, for example, is limited. In practice it’s maybe a couple of hundred. You can get around this by controlling point layers that can be switched on and off so fewer points are rendered at any one point But that’s a pain.</p>
