<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>I wrote a thesis, but a Markov chain can rewrite it and make about as much sense as the original.</p>
<p>See also an <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/04/30/markov-chain-phd-2/">updated version of this blog</a> for a better approach.</p>

<h1>Doc rot</h1>
<p>I wrote a PhD thesis in 2014 called ‘<a href="https://orca.cf.ac.uk/68365/" target="_blank">Effects of multiple environmental stressors on litter chemical composition and decomposition</a>’. See my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B50QikTiorWvUzBWSkVyTjJDYzA/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">viva presentation slides here</a> if you don’t really like words.</p>
<p>On graduation day, a stranger came up to me and, to paraphrase, said ‘you doctors should be proud of what you’ve achieved, you’re doing a great service’. I didn’t have the heart to tell him that I wasn’t a <em>medical</em> doctor. No, I was something nobler and altogether more unique: a doctor of rotting leaves.</p>
<p>You’re thinking: ‘gosh, what a complicated subject that must be; how could I ever hope to achieve such greatness?’ The answer is that you should simply take my thesis and use a Markov chain to generate new sentences until you have a fresh new thesis. The output will make probably as much sense as the original but won’t be detected easily by plagiarism software.</p>
<p>Heck, I’ll even do it for you in this post.</p>
<p>You’re welcome. Don’t forget to cite me.</p>

<div id="text-generation" class="section level1">
<h1>Text generation</h1>
<p>I’ll be using a very simple approach: Markov chains.</p>
<p>Basically, after providing an input data set, a Markov chain can generate the next word in a sentence given the current word. Selection of the new word is random but weighted by occurrences in your input file.</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://hackernoon.com/automated-text-generator-using-markov-chain-de999a41e047" target="_blank">a great post on Hackernoon that explains Markov chains for text generation</a>. For <a href="http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/" target="_blank">interactive visuals of Markov chains, go to setosa.io</a>.</p>
<p>Text generation is an expanding field and there are much more successful and complicated methods for doing it. For example, <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/" target="_blank">Andrej Karpathy generated some pretty convincing Shakespeare passages, Wikipedia pages and geometry papers in LaTeX using the ‘unreasonably effective’ and ‘magical’ power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</a>.</p>

<div id="code-source" class="section level2">
<h2>Code source</h2>
<p>I’ll be using modified R code written by <a href="http://www.primaryobjects.com/" target="_blank">Kory Becker</a> from <a href="https://gist.github.com/primaryobjects/4c7cca705eeba0d8bad6" target="_blank">this GitHub gist</a>.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <a href="https://rmhogervorst.nl/" target="_blank">Roel Hogervorst</a> did a swell job of <a href="http://rmhogervorst.nl/cleancode/blog/2017/01/21/content/post/2017-01-21-markov-chain/" target="_blank">generating Captain Picard text</a> in R from <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> scripts, which is certainly <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/04/14/r-trek-exploring-stardates/" target="_blank">in our wheelhouse</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Because I’m helpful I’ve created a text file version of my thesis. You can get it raw from my <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/draytasets" target="_blank">draytasets (<em>haha</em>) GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could get the data from the {dray} package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Download package from github with
# remotes::install_github(&quot;matt-dray/dray&quot;)

# Load {dray} package and assign data to object
library(dray)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Still D-R-A-Y</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>phd_text &lt;- dray::phd</code></pre>
<p>We’ll alter the data slightly for it to be ready for passing into the Markov chain.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Remove blank lines
phd_text &lt;- phd_text[nchar(phd_text) &gt; 0]

# Put spaces around common punctuation
# so they&#39;re not interpreted as part of a word

phd_text &lt;- gsub(&quot;,&quot;, &quot; ,&quot;, phd_text, fixed = TRUE)

<p>We’re going to seed the start of each ‘sentence’ (a sequence of <em>n</em> words, where we specify <em>n</em>). We’ll do this by supplying one of 50 unique values to the <code>set.seed()</code> function in turn. This seed then starts the chain within the <code>markovchainSequence()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>markov_output &lt;- data.frame(output = rep(NA, 50))

  set.seed(i)  # fresh seed for each element

<h2>Cherry-picked phrases</h2>
<p>The output is mostly trash because the Markov chain doesn’t have built in grammar or an understanding of sentence structure. It only ‘looks ahead’ given the current state.</p>
<p>You can also see that brackets don’t get closed, for example, though an opening bracket is often followed by an author citation or result of a statistical test, as we might expect given the source material.</p>
<p>I’ve selected some things from the output that basically look like normal(ish) phrases. Simply rearrange these to build a thesis!</p>
