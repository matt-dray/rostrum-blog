<h1>Doc rot</h1>
<p>I wrote a PhD thesis in 2014 called <a href="https://orca.cf.ac.uk/68365/"><em>Effects of multiple environmental stressors on litter chemical composition and decomposition</em></a>. See my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B50QikTiorWvUzBWSkVyTjJDYzA/view?usp=sharing">viva presentation slides here</a> if you don’t really like words.</p>
<p>On graduation day, a stranger came up to me and, to paraphrase, said ‘you doctors should be proud of what you’ve achieved, you’re doing a great service’. I didn’t have the heart to tell him that I wasn’t a <em>medical</em> doctor. No, I was something nobler and altogether more unique: <em>a doctor of rotting leaves</em>.</p>
<p>I know you’re thinking ‘gosh, what a complicated subject that must be; how could I ever hope to achieve such greatness?’. The answer is that you should simply take my thesis and use a Markov chain to generate new sentences until you have a fresh new thesis. The output will make probably as much sense as the original but won’t be detected easily by plagiarism software.</p>
<p>Heck, I’ll even do it for you in this post.</p>
<p>You’re welcome. Don’t forget to cite me.</p>

<h1>Text generation</h1>
<p>I’ll be using a very simple approach: Markov chains.</p>
<p>Basically, after providing an input dataset, a Markov chain can generate the <em>next</em> word in a sentence given the <em>current</em> word. Selection of the new word is random but weighted by occurrences in your input file.</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://hackernoon.com/automated-text-generator-using-markov-chain-de999a41e047">a great post on Hackernoon that explains Markov chains for text generation</a>. For <a href="http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/">interactive visuals of Markov chains, go to setosa.io</a>.</p>
<p>Text generation is an expanding field and there are much more successful and complicated methods for doing it. For example, <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">Andrej Karpathy generated some pretty convincing Shakespeare passages, Wikipedia pages and geometry papers in LaTeX using the ‘unreasonably effective’ and ‘magical’ power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</a>.</p>

<h1>Generate text</h1>
<div id="code-source" class="section level2">
<h2>Code source</h2>
<p>I’ll be using modified R code written by <a href="http://www.primaryobjects.com/">Kory Becker</a> that I found <a href="https://gist.github.com/primaryobjects/4c7cca705eeba0d8bad6">in a GitHub gist</a>.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <a href="https://rmhogervorst.nl/">Roel Hogervorst</a> did a swell job of <a href="http://rmhogervorst.nl/cleancode/blog/2017/01/21/content/post/2017-01-21-markov-chain/">generating Captain Picard text</a> in R from <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> scripts, which is certainly <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/04/14/r-trek-exploring-stardates/">in our wheelhouse</a>.</p>

<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>Because I’m helpful I’ve created a text file version of my thesis. You can get it raw from my <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/draytasets">draytasets (<em>haha</em>) GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could get the data from the <code>dray</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># download package from github

# load dray package and assign data to object
library(dray)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Still D-R-A-Y</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>phd_text &lt;- dray::phd</code></pre>
<p>We’ll alter the data slightly for it to be ready for passing into the Markov chain.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># remove blank lines
phd_text &lt;- phd_text[nchar(phd_text) &gt; 0]

# put spaces around common punctuation
# so they&#39;re not interpreted as part of a word

<p>Read the <code>markovchain</code> package and fit a Markov chain to the text data.</p>

<p>We’re going to seed the start of each ‘sentence’ (a sequence of <em>n</em> words, where we specify <em>n</em>). We’ll do this by supplying one of 50 unique values to the <code>set.seed()</code> function in turn. This seed then starts the chain within the <code>markovchainSequence()</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>markov_output &lt;- data.frame(output = rep(NA, 50))

<div id="cherry-picked-phrases" class="section level2">
<h2>Cherry-picked phrases</h2>
<p>The output is mostly trash because the Markov chain doesn’t have built in grammar or an understanding of sentence structure. It only ‘looks ahead’ given the current state.</p>
<p>You can also see that brackets don’t get closed, for example, though an opening bracket is often followed by an author citation or result of a statistical test, as we might expect given the source material.</p>
<p>I’ve selected some things from the output that basically look like normal(ish) phrases. Simply rearrange these to build a thesis!</p>
<p>My favourites (my comments in square brackets):</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all invertebrate species are among tree species [FACT.]</li>
<li>Effect of deciduous trees may be appreciated [They produce oxygen and fruits, after all.]</li>
<li>Species-specific utilization of Cardiff University [Well, humans go inside the uni, pigeons sit on the roof; I guess that’s ‘species-specific’.]</li>
<li>Litter was affected by Wallace , Dordrecht [Who is this Dutch guy who’s interfering with my studies?]</li>
<li>Bags permitted entry of stream ecosystem [I should hope so; I was investigating the effect of the stream ecosystem on the leaf litter stored in those bags, after all.]</li>
<li>Permutational Analysis and xylophagous invertebrates can affect ecosystem service provision [My analysis will affect the thing its analysing? The observer effect!]</li>
<li>Most studies could shift invertebrate communities [Hang on, this is the observer effect again; I thought I was studying ecology, not physics.]</li>
<li>This thesis is responsible for broad underlying principles to mass loss [Health warning: my thesis actually <em>causes</em> decay (possibly to your brain cells).]</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide enrichment altered chemical composition [Aha! Actually true!]</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other things that vaguely make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>The response variables were returned to predict leaf litters</li>
<li>shredder feeding was established for nutrient and urban pollution</li>
<li>Leaf litter chemical composition are comprised of differing acidity in Ystradffin</li>
<li>the no-choice situation with deionised water availability may reflect invertebrate feeding preferences</li>
<li>ground coarsely using a wide spectrum of stream ecosystem functioning</li>
<li>cages were already apparent</li>
<li>Schematic of aquatic invertebrate species for identifying the invertebrate assemblages during model fitting</li>
<li>Populus tremuloides clone under elevated CO2 had consistently been related to remove debris dams in woodland environments</li>
<li>the need to account for microphytobenthic biofilms are particularly affected by the Linnean Society , and lignin concentration</li>
<li>These findings suggest that the roles could not differ between time and bottom-up control of decomposition</li>
<li>rural litter decomposition of litter layer of leaf litter will influence invertebrate communities</li>
<li>the effects of carbon concentration in species’ feeding responses between tree species with caution given the 1970s , regardless of four weeks</li>
<li>Results were visualised in the breakdown</li>
<li>Measurements were in altered twig decay rates</li>
<li>Litter was little work in decomposing leaf litter of litter resulted in a range of twigs , as a result in upland streams</li>
<li>The basis of carbon compounds have influenced feeding preferences</li>
<li>Annual Review of the physical toughness of rotting detritus altered chemical composition and woodlice Porcellio species</li>
<li>Nitrogen concentrations and nitrogen transformations in both leaves grown under ambient CO2 levels of trembling aspen and invertebrate assemblage</li>
<li>Odontocerum albicorne was tied to elevated CO2 and terrestrial study was lower carbon sinks</li>
<li>a range of data stretching back 25 years of litter chemical composition ( 1979 ) for all interactions used microcosm type modified by elevated CO2</li>
<li>homogeneity of invertebrates as defined by increasing local microclimate and no influence mass loss</li>
