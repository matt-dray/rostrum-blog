```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE)
```

# Prepare the workspace

```{r message=FALSE}
library(spotifyr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)
```

You need to sign up for a Spotify developer account and add your client ID and client secret to the environment. This is passed to each of the functions of {spotifyr} to let us access the Spotify API.

```{r}
access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
```

# Get albums

The `get_artist_albums()` function takes an artist ID and fetches the albums for that artist.

The Mountain Goats can be identified by the URI `spotify:artist:3hyGGjxu73JuzBa757H6R5`, where the 22-character value is the artist ID used by {spotifyr}.

I've provided the `market` argument to restrict the albums to those released in only one area. This means we won't get multiple returns for the same album that was released in more than one area.

We do still end up with the same album appearing more than once, but this is because a deluxe version is included. We could use the `dedupe_album_names()` function to remove doubles, but the function also removes things labeled as 'deluxe', 'reissue', etc. Instead I've simply filtered out 'Goths (Deluxe Version)'.

```{r}
goat_albums <- get_artist_albums(
  id = "3hyGGjxu73JuzBa757H6R5",  # from the artist URI
  include_groups = "album",  # albums only, not singles
  limit = 25,  # return a max of 25
  market = "US"  # only the ones released in this market
) %>% 
  select(album_id = id, album_name = name, release_date) %>%  # columns of focus
  filter(album_name != "Goths (Deluxe Version)") %>%  # remove dupe album
  mutate(release_date = substr(release_date, 1, 4))  # extract year

goat_albums
```

# Get album tracks

We can iterate over the album IDs using {purrr} to fetch the tracks from each. `map_df()` returns the results in a tibble.

```{r}
named_album_id <- set_names(goat_albums$album_id, goat_albums$album_id)

goat_tracks <- map_df(
  .x = named_album_id,
  .f = get_album_tracks,
  .id = "album_id"
) %>%
  select(album_id, track_id = id, track_name = name)  # simplify dataframe

sample_n(goat_tracks, 5)
```

# Get audio features

We have albums and tracks, but the Spotify API also returns 'audio features'. This includes things like time signature, key and tempo, but also some more exotic things like 'speechiness', 'actousticness' and 'danceability'.

```{r}
# We can only fetch 100 at a time, but there are >300 tracks
audio1 <- get_track_audio_features(goat_tracks$track_id[1:100])
audio2 <- get_track_audio_features(goat_tracks$track_id[101:200])
audio3 <- get_track_audio_features(goat_tracks$track_id[201:300])
audio4 <- get_track_audio_features(goat_tracks$track_id[301:312])

# Bind the data together
goat_features <- bind_rows(audio1, audio2, audio3, audio4) %>% 
  select(
    track_id = id, everything(),
    -uri, -track_href, -analysis_url
  )

names(goat_features)
```

And here's a few examples

```{r}
sample_n(goat_features, 5)
```

# Join everything together

We've collected three datasets: albums, tracks and audio features. We can join them all by ID values.

```{r}
# Join tracks to albums by album ID
# Join features to tracks by track ID
goat_disco <- right_join(goat_albums, goat_tracks, by = "album_id") %>% 
  left_join(goat_features, by = "track_id")

goat_disco
```

# Visuals

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

p <- goat_disco %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = danceability, y = valence, colour = album_name, group = track_name)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_grey()
ggplotly(p)

goat_numeric %>% select(danceability, energy, valence, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, tempo) %>% plot()
```

```{r}
p2 <- goat_disco %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = album_name, y = valence, group = track_name)) +
  #geom_point() +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_color_grey() +
  coord_flip()
ggplotly(p2)
```

# Clusters

```{r}
goat_numeric <- select(
  goats_disco,
  
  #-album_id, -album_name, -release_date, -track_id, -track_name, -type
) 
goat_cluster <- kmeans(goat_numeric, centers = 3)

summary(goat_cluster)

library(broom)

augment(goat_cluster, goat_numeric)


clust <- bind_cols(goat_disco, enframe(goat_cluster$cluster)) %>% rename(cluster = value)

ggplot(, aes())
```
