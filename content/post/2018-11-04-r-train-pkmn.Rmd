# You teach me and I'll teach you

[I recently shared some materials that I made to help some colleagues understand and start to use R Markdown as part of a reproducible workflow](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/09/24/knitting-club/). 

Well, now I'm sharing another thing I made. It's called [*Beginner R and R Training (featuring Pokemon!)*](https://matt-dray.github.io/beginner-r-feat-pkmn/). It's an introduction to R, RStudio, R Projects, directory structure and the Tidyverse for beginners... and uses [Pokemon Go](http://origin.pokemongo.com/) data that I collected myself.[^1]

I'd like to think it's a work in progress, but I've since left the organisation and may not update it for some time. I know others have used some of the material in their own training sessions and I encourage you to [fork it on GitHub and do the same](https://github.com/matt-dray/beginner-r-feat-pkmn).

[Visit the page where it's hosted in all its glory](https://matt-dray.github.io/beginner-r-feat-pkmn/).

# Gotta badly draw 'em all

It didn't escape your notice that I drew some stunning images for the training material. I've reproduced them here so you can enjoy them all in one place.[^2]

[^1]: The training material refers to [my 'draytasets' repository to access these data](https://github.com/matt-dray/draytasets), but you can also get it from [the `pkmn_go` function in my `dray` package](https://matt-dray.github.io/dray/).
