# You teach me and I'll teach you

[I recently shared some materials that I made to help some colleagues understand and start to use R Markdown as part of a reproducible workflow](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/09/24/knitting-club/). 

Well, now I'm sharing another thing I made. It's called [*Beginner R and RStudio Training (featuring Pokemon!)*](https://matt-dray.github.io/beginner-r-feat-pkmn/). It's an introduction to R, RStudio, R Projects, directory structure and the Tidyverse for beginners... and uses [Pokemon Go](http://origin.pokemongo.com/) data that I collected myself.[^1]

You should go and [visit the page where it's hosted in all its glory](https://matt-dray.github.io/beginner-r-feat-pkmn/).

I'd like to think it's a work in progress, but I've since left the organisation and may not update it for some time. I know others have used some of the material in their own training sessions and I encourage you to [fork it on GitHub and do the same](https://github.com/matt-dray/beginner-r-feat-pkmn).

# Other materials

Why bother making yet another training thing? Well, it reflects my own thinking and is therefore much easier for me to explain to others. Also... Pokemon.

Below are some other training materials you might like to look at.

## Starting with R and RStudio

* [Software Carpentry's Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/)
* [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) teaches you R interactively, from within RStudio itself
* Further information about R Projects is available from the [RStudio Support pages](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)
* [Starting data analysis/wrangling with R: Things I wish I'd been told](http://reganmian.net/blog/2014/10/14/starting-data-analysiswrangling-with-r-things-i-wish-id-been-told/) by Stian Håklev

## Tidy data

* [Basics of 'tidy' data and the 'tidyverse' of packages](http://rpubs.com/aelhabr/tidyverse-basics)
* [DataCamp's Introduction to the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) (£)

## Going further

* [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](http://stat545.com/) from STAT 545 at the Uni of British Columbia
* [Online learning from RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/): R Programming, Shiny, R Markdown and Data Science
* An [exhaustive Quora question](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-resources-for-learning-R-1) with links to resources

## Data Science in R

* [An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R](http://moderndive.com/) by ModernDive
* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [exercise solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/)

## Getting help

* [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) (including help with `readr`, `dplyr` and `ggplot2`)
* Often it helps to produce a small [reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (a 'reprex') of your code if you run into trouble
* [Getting help with R](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200552336-Getting-Help-with-R) page of resources from RStudio
* Explore questions and answers tagged with 'r' on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

# Gotta badly draw 'em all

It didn't escape your notice that I drew some stunning images for the training material. I've reproduced them here so you can enjoy them all in one place.[^2]

[^1]: The training material refers to [my 'draytasets' repository to access these data](https://github.com/matt-dray/draytasets), but you can also get it from [the `pkmn_go` function in my `dray` package](https://matt-dray.github.io/dray/).
[^2]: Which is your favourite? *All of them?* You're too kind.
