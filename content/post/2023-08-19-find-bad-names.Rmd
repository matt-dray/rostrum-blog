# tl;dr

I wrote an R function to help identify variable names that already exist as function names, like in `c <- 1` or `head <- "x"`.

# Naming and shaming

Naming things is hard, yes, but `data` is a short and sensible choice for a dataframe, right?

```{r error=TRUE}
data[data$column == 1, ]
```

Oh, silly me, I tried to subset a dataframe called `data` without actually, y'know, creating it first.

This is [a classic stumbling block](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%22object+of+type+%27closure%27+is+not+subsettable%22+%5Br%5D) in R. In short, there's already a function in base R called `data` and so ended up trying subset it. But you can't subset a function, hence the error.

Here's what happens if you subset a non-existent object that has a name that's different to any existing functions:

```{r x, error=TRUE}
x[x$column == 1, ]
```

'Object not found' is a much more helpful error message.

# What's in a name?

So it's not a big deal, but using existing function names as variable names is a [code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell). Especially if they're frequently used functions from base R like `head`, `str`, `paste`,  etc. 

But R doesn't stop you from using these names. In general, R is pretty loose with variable naming, though you can't use a small set of [reserved words](https://search.r-project.org/R/refmans/base/html/Reserved.html) like `TRUE`, `if` or `NA`.

For example, here we can call the `c()` function to see its (very short) definition. But using it as a variable name obscures the function definition.

```{r c}
c  # this refers to the function
c <- 1
c  # this now refers to the variable!
rm(c)  # tidy up by removing variable
```

Can we write a generic function to identify if some code contains 'bad' variable names in this way?

# Symbolic gesture

Of course. I've made a function called `find_var_names()`. I'm certain the functionality already exists; consider this a thought experiment.

You provide (a) a string of code to evaluate[^conn] and (b) a vector of names to avoid. The code is parsed with `getparsedata(parse())` to identify variable names[^parse]. It checks for a `SYMBOL` token followed by the assignment operators `<-` or `=`[^assign], or preceded by an assignment operator in the case of `->`[^dassign] (i.e. `*_ASSIGN` tokens). These variable names are then compared to the set of names provided.

```{r find-var-names}
find_var_names <- function(code_string, names_to_find) {
  
  # Parse the string of code to identify R 'tokens'
  parsed <- getParseData(parse(text = code_string, keep.source = TRUE))
  parsed <- parsed[parsed$text != "", ]
  
  # Identify subsequent tokens (to help find 'x' in x <- 1 and x = 1)
  parsed$next_token <- 
    c(parsed$token[2:nrow(parsed)], NA_character_)
  
  # Identify prior token (to help find 'x' in 1 -> x)
  parsed$last_token <- 
    c(NA_character_, parsed$token[1:nrow(parsed) - 1])
  
  # Identify variable names with left-assignment
  lassign <- 
    parsed[parsed$token == "SYMBOL" & grepl("ASSIGN", parsed$next_token), ]
  
  # Identify row index for variable names following right-assignment
  rassign_i <- 
    which(parsed$token == "RIGHT_ASSIGN" & parsed$next_token == "SYMBOL") + 1
  
  # Filter for right-assigned variable names
  rassign <- parsed[rassign_i, ]
  
  # Combine the results and sort by location
  var_names <- rbind(lassign, rassign)
  var_names <- var_names[sort(row.names(var_names)), ]
  
  # Filter for variable names that are in the provided names list
  var_names[var_names$text %in% names_to_find, !grepl("_token", names(var_names))]
  
}
```

So, let's say we have this snippet of R code[^rstring] below. It uses some variable names that are already function names, as well as each flavour of assignment.

```{r demo-code}
demo_code <- r"{data <- "x"
head = head(chickwts)
"y" -> df
a <- beaver1[1:3]
b <- 2 -> c}"
```

And here's a function that grabs the base packages and the function names within. This is what we'll use as our 'no-go' variable names. You could expand this to include other names, like function names from the tidyverse, for example.

```{r get-base-functions}
get_base_functions <- function() {
  base_names <- sessionInfo()$basePkgs
  base_pkgs <- paste0("package:", base_names)
  lapply(base_pkgs, ls) |> unlist() |> unique() |> sort()
}

tail(get_base_functions())
```

Aside: this function uses a little hack. It specificaloy grabs the attached base packages from the `sessionInfo()` listing. There are other base and 'recommended' packages that are actually not attached from the start of your session; see the `Priority` value from the output of `installed.packages()`.

Now we can run the function to check the code for the list of function names.

```{r naughty-words-df}
naughty_words <- find_var_names(
  code_string = demo_code,
  names_to_find = get_base_functions()
)

naughty_words
```

The output is what you normally get from `getparsedata(parse())`, filtered for the illegal names. Helpfully it shows you the exact row and column indices for where the string exists in the code you provided.

And of course you can just isolate the offenders.

```{r naughty-words-vec}
naughty_words$text |> unique() |> sort()
```

## Seeking closure

I probably won't use this function in real life, but maybe the concepts are interesting to you or you can tell me about a linter that does this already.

At least for now, object of type 'Matthew' is not upsettable.

[^rstring]: This is an 'R string', introduced in R version 4.0.0. It deals with escaping certain characters and quotes within quotes so that you don't have to. So `"x <- "y""` will error but `r"(x <- "y")"` will return `"x <- \"y\""`.  You can use symbols other than parentheses, such as curly braces, if your expression already contains parentheses itself.
[^assign]: If you haven't already [expunged](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/03/13/assign/) any files containing equals assignment.
[^dassign]: I'll have to update this in future to work with [down-assignment arrows](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/06/07/assign-down/).
[^parse]: If you can be parsed, I've [written about this](https://www.rostrum.blog/2023/03/03/getparsedata/) before.
[^conn]: Exercise for the reader: have the function accept script files from a connection, not just as a string. I didn't bother for this silly demo.
