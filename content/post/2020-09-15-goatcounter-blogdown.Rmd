# tl;dr

I've removed Google Analytics from this site and replace it with GoatCounter.

# Problem

GA is bloated.
Google is 'tracky'.
I just want to see counts of people visiting pages through time and how they got here.

# Solution

GotaCounter.

# How

Removed from config.toml
HTML added into page; deployed via Netlify

# Interface

Simple
clean
Perfectly whelming

# GA findings
