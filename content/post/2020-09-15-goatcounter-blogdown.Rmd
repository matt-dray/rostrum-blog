# tl;dr

This site now uses [GoatCounter]() instead of [Google Analytics](). GoatCounter is a lightweight and unobtrusive site-visit counter made by the independent developer [Martin Tournoij](https://www.arp242.net).

# What I need

[I write posts on this blog for me, primarily](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/02/27/get-blogging/). It's great if others find the content useful or interesting. I don't and never will make money from this site, so why would I care how many visits it gets?

A highly-viewed post indicates to me that the topic is worth talking about. It's a signal that it might be worth writing more about that thing in future.

Given how quickly things change, it's also good to know which posts might need updating or need to carry a health warning. I don't want people to visit this blog and be given erroneous or out-of-date information.

So I think I have a use case. Except I don't want to 'track'; I just want a count of visits to each page.

# Friendship ended

I've been using Google Analytics for this blog since it began in April 2018. Why? It's free, it's ubiquitous, it's easily implemented.

Google Analytics is massively bloated for my use case, though. I don't need to create marketing reports, optimise for click rates or see what visitors have eaten for breakfast. 

But mostly I'm uncomfortable with various [privacy concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google) around the company and platform. I don't need or want you to be tracked. I don't want to be a potential node for data harvesting.

# New best friend

So why is GoatCounter better?

1. Privacy
1. Considerate
1. Transparency
1. Lightweight
1. Simple interface

It probably doesn't need a GDPR notice. goatcounter.com/gdpr

The process is up front.

# The divorce

Switching to GoatCounter was easy. There were basically two steps:

1. Goodbye GA: I removed the Google Analytics token from [the site's `config.toml` file](https://github.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/blob/master/config.toml)
1. Hello GoatCounter: I added a supplied line of code to the `<body>` of the site

Painless. And in fact, I used a feature of Netlify to add the needed line of code. The service inserts the code on deployment, without needing to add it explicitly to your site.

This site was made with the R package {blogdown}, which uses Hugo, and is deployed using Netlify. Your mileage may vary.
