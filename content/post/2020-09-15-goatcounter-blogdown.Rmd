# tl;dr

This blog now uses [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) instead of [Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics). GoatCounter is a lightweight and unobtrusive site-visit counter made by developer [Martin Tournoij](https://www.arp242.net).

# Do blogposts dream of electric goats?

[I write posts on this blog for me and for other learners](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/02/27/get-blogging/). It's great if people find the content useful or interesting. 

But I don't and never will make money from this site, so why would I care how many visits it gets?

A highly-viewed post indicates to me that the topic is worth talking about. It's a signal that it might be worth writing more about that thing in future. Popular posts might also need updating over time to keep the information up to date.

So I think I have a use case. Except I don't want to 'track' people; I just want to count visits views.

# Friendship ended

I've been using [Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics) for this blog since it began in April 2018. Why? My naïve reasons were that it's free, it's ubiquitous and it's easily [implemented in {blogdown}](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html).

It's massively bloated for my use case though. Acquisition reports, revenue per user and cohort analysis are not relevant to me. And I don't even know what they mean.

More importantly, I'm uncomfortable with various [privacy concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google) around the company and platform. I don't need or want you to be the product.

This change has been a long time coming and follows my earlier removal of [the Disqus comment platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus), thanks to [a Maëlle Salmon post](https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/).

# New best friend

[A number of alternatives are available](https://alternativeto.net/software/google-analytics/),[^alt] but I chose [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) by independent developer [Martin Tournoij](https://www.arp242.net). Why?

To summarise, the large type at the top of [the GoatCounter home page](https://www.goatcounter.com/) says:

> Easy web analytics. No tracking of personal data.

What does that encompass?

| What | Explain |
| :--- | :--- |
| Privacy | GoatCounter doesn't collect personally-identifiable data and as such it ['probably doesn't require a GDPR consent notice'](https://www.goatcounter.com/gdpr). |
| Simple web interface | [A clean interface](https://www.goatcounter.com/design) with focus on visits and viewers over time ([see a live demo](https://stats.arp242.net/)).  |
| Transparent | GoatCounter is [open source](https://github.com/zgoat/goatcounter) and the creator is open about comparisons to other products. |
| Thoughtful | The creator has [written openly about the rationale](https://github.com/zgoat/goatcounter/blob/master/docs/rationale.markdown) and has considered users of assistive tech. |
| Free | With paid plans or donations available ([Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/arp242/), [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/arp242)). |
| Lightweight | It's less than 3 kb. |


# Herding GoatCounter

Switching to GoatCounter was straightforward. 

This blog was created with the R package [{blogdown}](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), which is built on the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/), and it's deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Your mileage may vary, but there were basically three steps:

1. Remove the Google Analytics token from [the site's `config.toml` file](https://github.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/blob/master/config.toml).
1. [Create a GoatCounter account](https://www.goatcounter.com/signup).
1. Add a single script tag to the `<body>` of your site[^tag].

For that last step I used [a special Netlify feature that inserts code snippets into the HTML of your site on deployment](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/post-processing/snippet-injection/).[^maxyfc] I didn't have to worry about where to put it in the code of the site.

<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Analytics straight into the vein.</p>
</div>

Your stats will then be available from a URL in the form `https://yoursite.goatcounter.com`, which you set during the sign-up process.

Now you can start counting sheep. Er... goats.

# Greatest Of All Time (GOAT)

The switch does mean I'll lose cumulative view counts for posts that already exist, but I'm not bothered about that. I can always export the Google Analytics data and manually add it to GoatCounter's counts.

For interest, here's the most viewed posts as counted by Google Analytics:

1. [Repaying Tom Nook with {R6}](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/04/04/repaying-tom-nook-with-r6/) (Apr 2020)
1. [Packages that Sparked Joy in 2019](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/12/27/pkgs-2019/) (Dec 2019)
1. [Package a {xaringan} template](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/05/24/xaringan-template/) (May 2019)
1. [Mail merge with R and Dawson's Creek](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/06/26/mail-merge/) (Jun 2018)
1. [How do you pronounce {dplyr}?](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/09/20/say-package/) (Sep 2019)

In particular, the [post about {R6}](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/04/04/repaying-tom-nook-with-r6/) is a good example of something I wanted to learn and then blog about for posterity. I think the timing helped in people viewing it, since [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/) had just been released to great fanfare. To illustrate the 'zeitgeistiness', this post had the highest view spike of any post and has settled down a great deal since then.

The ['mail merge' post](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/06/26/mail-merge/) is a good example of [that classic David Robinson tweet](https://twitter.com/drob/status/928447584712253440?s=20): 

> When you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a function. When you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post

Given its popularity, I also decided to overhaul it to make it more simple and accessible. It also led to a later post on [parameterised R Markdown reports](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/03/12/knit-with-params/), which I think is actually the better solution in most cases.

I wouldn't have known any of this without having a record of page views, but the method for collecting that data no longer [grinds my goat](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=grinds%20my%20goat).
