<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>You can query the Google Maps API in R with the <code>gmapsdistance</code> package. I used it to find travel times between NBA teams and learnt that travelling half the width of a continent requires a lot of petrol.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-nba" class="section level1">
<h1>The NBA</h1>
<p>The USA is quite big.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that the USA’s National Basketball Association (NBA) organised their teams geographically: two ‘conferences’ – Western and Eastern – with three ‘divisions’ of five teams each. Right?</p>
<p>Yes, for the Central division of the Eastern Conference. It contains the Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Indiana Pacers and Milwaukee Bucks – cities clustered near Lakes Michigan and Erie.</p>
<p>But also no, not for the Northwest Division of the Western Conference. This stretches from Portland Trail Blazers in the Pacific Northwest to Oklahoma City Thunder, which is actually in the country’s south-central region. Far from clustering, Utah Jazz and Colorado’s Denver Nuggets sit on a line between these two. The fifth team? That’s Minnesota Timberwolves, which by rights should be part of the Central Division</p>
<p>What does this mean for the travelling basketball fans?</p>
</div>
<div id="travel-time-with-gmapsdistance" class="section level1">
<h1>Travel time with <code>gmapsdistance</code></h1>
<p>The R package <a href="https://github.com/rodazuero/gmapsdistance"><code>gmapsdistance</code></a> wraps the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps">Google Maps</a> <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82">API</a>. You can use it to query origin and destination points for travel distance (metres) and duration (seconds) for several modes of travel: on foot, by car, by public transport, or by bicycle (for parts of North America only).</p>
<p>We need an API key for Google Maps. This helps prevent misuse of their service and tracks your access. Your first $300 is free.</p>
<p>The process is outlined in detail on <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/get-api-key#key">the Google developer pages</a>. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/">Go to the website</a> and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>Keep this key safe for now; we’ll read it in later.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Get data</h1>
<p>We can use <a href="https://github.com/hadley/rvest">Hadley Wickham’s <code>rvest</code> package</a> to scrape the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association">Wikipedia page for the NBA)</a>, which contains a table of teams and locations.</p>
<p>We’ll start by setting up our workspace.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)  # data manipulation
library(rvest)  # web scraping
library(stringr)  # string manipulation</code></pre>
<p>Then we’ll create objects that define the HTML for the web page and the table we want. The latter is defined using a CSS selector or, as in our case, an xpath. Think of these as ‘addresses’ for HTML content. You can use the ‘inspect’ function in your browser or <a href="https://selectorgadget.com/">the selectorgadget browser extension</a> to get this information.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Read the HTML from a specified web URL
html &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association&quot;)

# Use the Scrapy tool or &#39;inspect&#39; in your browser to get the table xpath
table_xpath &lt;- &#39;//*[@id=&quot;mw-content-text&quot;]/div/table[4]&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Now we can collect the table and manipulate it.</p>
<p>We could use the latitude and longitude from this table as our origin and destination points, but the arena name, city and state will be enough. We can create a column in our data in the form <code>arena+city+state</code>, which is the format required by Google Maps.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nba_table &lt;-
  html_nodes(x = html, xpath = table_xpath) %&gt;%  # scrape the HTML
  html_table(fill = TRUE, header = NA) %&gt;%  # parse as table
  as.data.frame() %&gt;%  # convert from list
  filter(Division == &quot;Northwest&quot;) %&gt;%  # NW division only
  mutate(
    Search = paste(Arena, City.State),  # combine location details
    Search = str_replace_all(Search, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;&quot;),  # replace comma with blank
    Search = str_replace_all(Search, &quot; &quot;, &quot;+&quot;),  # replace space with plus
    `Team code` = case_when(
      Team == &quot;Denver Nuggets&quot; ~ &quot;DEN&quot;,
      Team == &quot;Minnesota Timberwolves&quot; ~ &quot;MIN&quot;,
      Team == &quot;Oklahoma City Thunder&quot; ~ &quot;OKC&quot;,
      Team == &quot;Portland Trail Blazers&quot; ~ &quot;POR&quot;,
      Team == &quot;Utah Jazz&quot; ~ &quot;UTA&quot;
    )
  ) %&gt;% 
  select(Team, `Team code`, Arena, City = City.State, Search)

nba_table </code></pre>
<p>So now we have a simple table of teams, locations and a search string that we’ll pass to <code>gmapsdistance()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="calculate-distances" class="section level1">
<h1>Calculate distances</h1>
<p>The basic arguments to the <code>gmpasdistance()</code> function are the origin and destination (can be an address, postcode or latlong coordinates), the mode of travel (car, public transit, walking) and the return format (shape) of the data (each origin-destination pair per row, or a matrix). We want all possible combinations</p>
<p>We can make our key available in the package environment by using the <code>set.api.key()</code> function from the <code>gmapsdistance</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(gmapsdistance)  # install with install.packages() first

# Set the API key
set.api.key(&quot;YOUR-API-KEY&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can query Google Maps with the API key. I’ve explained the function arguments in the code comments.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nba_travel &lt;- 
  gmapsdistance(
    key = get.api.key(),  # retrieve the API key we set in the step above
    origin = nba_table$Search,  # vector of locations from our dataframe
    destination = nba_table$Search,  # as above
    combinations = &quot;all&quot;,  # all possible pairs of locations
    mode = &quot;driving&quot;,  # rather than walking, public transport or cycling
    shape = &quot;long&quot;  # one row per location-pair
  )</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="output" class="section level1">
<h1>Output</h1>
<p>What does the output look like?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>glimpse(nba_travel)</code></pre>
<p>It’s a list object with three elements: <code>Time</code>, <code>Distance</code> and <code>Status</code>. Each list element is a dataframe with three columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>or</code> – the origin point</li>
<li><code>de</code> – the destination point</li>
<li>one of <code>Time</code> in seconds, <code>Distance</code> in metres or <code>Status</code> (‘OK’)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>All our requests returned ‘OK’ for <code>Status</code> so there were no problems wth fetching the data.</p>
<p>The data is returned in a tidy data frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nba_travel$Distance</code></pre>
<p>We can make these data more useable by making a distance (kilometres) look-up between origin teams (rows) and destination teams (columns).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># So we can spread out data into &#39;wide format&#39;
library(tidyr)

# Create a mini-lookup of search strings to team codes
nba_lookup &lt;- select(nba_table, `Team code`, Search)

# Create easy look-up table for travel distances between teams
nba_travel$Distance %&gt;%
  left_join(nba_lookup, by = c(&quot;or&quot; = &quot;Search&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  left_join(
    nba_lookup, by = c(&quot;de&quot; = &quot;Search&quot;), suffix = c(&quot; (or)&quot;, &quot; (de)&quot;)
  ) %&gt;% 
  mutate(Distance = round(Distance/1000, 1)) %&gt;% 
  select(`Team code (or)`, `Team code (de)`, Distance) %&gt;% 
  spread(key = `Team code (de)`, value = Distance)</code></pre>
<p>We can do a similar thing for time and print it in hours.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Package for tidy time handling
library(lubridate)

# Create easy look-up table for travel time between teams
nba_travel$Time %&gt;%
  left_join(nba_lookup, by = c(&quot;or&quot; = &quot;Search&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  left_join(
    nba_lookup, by = c(&quot;de&quot; = &quot;Search&quot;), suffix = c(&quot; (or)&quot;, &quot; (de)&quot;)
  ) %&gt;% 
  mutate(Time = round(Time/60/60, 1)) %&gt;% 
  select(`Team code (or)`, `Team code (de)`, Time) %&gt;% 
  spread(key = `Team code (de)`, value = Time)</code></pre>
</div>
