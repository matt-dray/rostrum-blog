# tl;dr

Eight per cent (!) of the commits to [this blog's source](https://github.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog) involve typo fixes, according to a function I wrote to search commit messages via [the {gh} package](https://github.com/r-lib/gh). 

# Not my typo

I'm sure you've seen consecutive Git commits from jaded developers like 'fix problem', 'actually fix problem?', 'the fix broke something else', 'burn it all down'. Sometimes a few swear words will be thrown in for good measure (look no further than ['Developers Swearing'](https://twitter.com/gitlost?lang=en) on Twitter).

The more obvious problem from reading the commits for this blog is my incessant keyboard mashing; I think a lot of my commits are there to fix typos.[^check]

So I've prepared a little R function to grab the commit messages for a specified repo and find the ones that contain a given search term, like 'typo'.[^typi]

# Search commits

[{gh}](https://github.com/r-lib/gh) is a handy R package from Gábor Csárdi, Jenny Bryan and Hadley Wickham that we can use to interact with [GitHub's REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).[^dump]  We can also use [{purrr}](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) for iterating over the returned API object.

```{r pkgs}
library(gh)    # CRAN v1.2.0
library(purrr) # CRAN v0.3.4
```

So, here's one way of forming a function to search commit messages:

```{r fn}
search_commits <- function(owner, repo, string = "typo") {
  
  commits <- gh::gh(
    "GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits",
    owner = owner, repo = repo,
    .limit = Inf
  )

  messages <- purrr::map_chr(
    commits, ~purrr::pluck(.x, "commit", "message")
  )
  
  matches <- messages[grepl(string, messages, ignore.case = TRUE)]
  
  out <- list(
    meta = list(owner, repo),
    counts = list(
      match_count = length(matches),
      commit_count = length(messages),
      match_ratio = length(matches) / length(messages)
    ),
    matches = matches,
    messages = messages
  )
  
  return(out)
  
}
```

First we pass a `GET` request to the GitHub API via `gh::gh()`. The [API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) tells us the form needed to [get commits for a given `owner`'s `repo`](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-commits).

Beware: the API returns results in batches of some maximum size, but the `.limit = Inf` argument automatically creates additional requests until everything is returned. That might mean a lot of API calls.

Next we can use {purrr} to iteratively `pluck()` out the commit messages from the list returned by `gh::gh()`. It's then a case of finding which ones contain a search string of interest (defaulting to the word 'typo').

The object returned `search_commits()` is a list with four elements: `meta` repeats the user and repo names; `counts` is a list with the commit count, the count of messages containing the search term, and their ratio; and the `messages` and `matches` elements contain all messages and the ones containing the search term, respectively.

# Fniding my typoes

Here's an example where I look for commit messages to this blog that contain the word 'typo'. Since the function contains the `.limit = Inf` argument in `gh::gh()`, we'll get an output message for each separate request that's been made to the API.

```{r ex_blog}
blog_typos <- search_commits("matt-dray", "rostrum-blog")
```

Here's a preview of the structure of the returned object. You can see how it's a list that contains the values and other list elements that we expected.

```{r str}
str(blog_typos)
```

You can see there were `r blog_typos$counts$commit_count` commit messages returned, of which `r blog_typos$counts$match_count` contained the string 'typo'. That's `r 100 * round(blog_typos$counts$match_ratio, 2)` per cent.

Here's a sample of those commit messages that contained the word 'typo': 

```{r ex_blog_msg}
set.seed(1066)
sample(blog_typos$matches, 5)
```

It seems the typos are often corrected with general improvements to a post's copy. This usually happens when I read the post the next day with fresh eyes and groan at my ineptitude.[^inept]

# Exposing others

I think typos are probably most often referenced in repos that involve a lot of documentation, or a book or something. 

To make myself feel better, I had a quick look at the repo for the {bookdown} project [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.

```{r ex_other, include=FALSE}
typos_r4ds <- search_commits("hadley", "r4ds")
```
```{r ex_other_fake, eval=FALSE}
typos_r4ds <- search_commits("hadley", "r4ds")
```

The result:

```{r ex_other_out}
str(typos_r4ds)
```

Surprise: typos happen to all of us. I'm guessing the percentage is quite high because the book has a lot of readers scouring it, finding small issues and providing quick fixes.

# In other words

Of course, you can change the `string` argument of `search_commits()` to find terms other than the default 'typo'. Use your imagination. 

Here's a meta example: messages containing emoji (expressed as `:thing:`) in the commits to [the {emo} package](https://github.com/hadley/emo) by Hadley Wickham, Romain François and Lucy D'Agostino McGowan.

```{r ex_emo}
emo_emoji <- search_commits("hadley", "emo", ":.*:")
str(emo_emoji)
```

Only `r 100 * round(emo_emoji$counts$match_ratio, 2)`? Son, I am disappoint. `r emo::ji("face_with_raised_eyebrow")`

[^dump]: I used it most recently in [my little {ghdump} package](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/06/14/ghdump/) for downloading or cloning a user's repos en masse.
[^check]: Yes, I'm aware of Git hooks and various GitHub Actions that could prevent this.
[^typi]: Though obviously you'll miss messages containing the word 'typo' if you have a typo in the word 'typo' in one of your commits...
[^inept]: I wonder how many typos I'll need to correct in _this_ post after publishing.
