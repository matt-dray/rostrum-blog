<h1>Open data</h1>
<p>Deer roam Scotland. So do humans. It’s a problem when they meet at high speed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.deercollisions.co.uk/">The National Deer-Vehicle Collisions Project</a>, administered by <a href="http://www.thedeerinitiative.co.uk/">The Deer Initiative</a>, has been monitoring data on deer-vehicle collisions in the UK.</p>
<p>The data are open. I found the dataset when skimming through <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/838b88d8-7509-435c-9649-90f1881b5ad7/deer-vehicle-collisions">data.gov.uk</a> (a classic weekend activity for all the family). It links to the <a href="https://gateway.snh.gov.uk/natural-spaces/dataset.jsp?dsid=DVC">SNH Natural Spaces site</a> where you can download the data as shapefile, GML or KML under the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government Licence</a>.</p>
<p>I couldn’t find an interactive visualisation of these data and I don’t spend much time working with R Shiny,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> so why not.</p>

<div id="a-simple-shiny-app" class="section level1">
<h1>A simple Shiny app</h1>
<p>The app is <a href="https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/scot-deer-collisions/">live at mattdray.shinyapps.io/scot-deer-collisions/</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/scot-deer-collisions">code for the app is available on GitHub</a>. You can also <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/scot-deer-collisions/tree/master/data">download the cleaned data in CSV or RDS format</a>.</p>
<p>It’s built in R with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shinydashboard for a nice layout and value boxes</li>
<li>Leaflet for the interactive map</li>
<li>DT for the interactive datatable</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level1">
<h1>Limitations</h1>
<p>I may update the app in future or take it down entirely. <a href="https://www.github.com/matt-dray/scot-deer-collisions">The code will continue to exist on GitHub</a> where you can leave an issue or fork it to make it better.</p>
<p>I limited the filters to year, month and local authority. I could have included deer species and road, but the data are sparse and the formatting wasn’t great. I cleaned these variables up a bit and they’re available as filterable columns in the table.</p>
<p>There’s a large number of points and it doesn’t make sense to show them all at once because it slows the app down. There are methods for improving this, but I assume most people will be looking at specific local authorities or roads rather than the country as a whole.</p>
<p>I had originally intended for this to be a tool built with Flexdashboard and Crosstalk – which would have allowed for linked brushing – but browsers would ismply crash once a certain number of points were on screen.</p>
