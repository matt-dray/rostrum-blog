# tl;dr

I've written [the concept R package {tamRgo}](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo) to simulate a persistent digital pet in your R console. 

# Had an oeuf?

R is a game engine[^explain]; don't @ me[^fosstodon]. 

Naturally, R can [keep a save state](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#sec-data-persistent): developers can write a file to the platform-independent path on a user's machine resolved by [`tools::R_user_dir()`](https://rdrr.io/r/tools/userdir.html).[^rappdirs]

Obviously I've used this to make a concept R package: [{tamRgo}](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo). It saves locally a 'blueprint' for a  [_Tamgotchi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi)-like digital pet[^tama], which is read and updated when you interact with your it in the R console.

_Tamago_ (egg) + _uotchi_ ('watch') = _Tamagotchi_. _Tamago_ + R = {tamRgo}.

# Crack it open

## Nuovo uovo

Use {remotes} to install the package [from GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo). There's also [an accompanying documentation website](https://matt-dray.github.io/tamRgo/).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("tamRgo")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/tamRgo")
library(tamRgo)
```

It has no package dependencies, but you'll need to be running a version of R greater than 4.0.

Of course, it's just a toy to demonstrate a concept. I've built out a bit of a 'game loop', but it's just for fun and the code is not optimised. [Suggestions and code contributions always welcome](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo/issues).

## Nuovo uovo

To begin, you'll need to generate a new pet by laying an egg. You'll be asked to confirm it's okay to save a blueprint file onto your computer, which is just a small list object stored as an RDS file.

```{r eval=FALSE}
> lay_egg(pet_name = "BERTHA")
# Save pet blueprint? y/n: y
# Saved pet blueprint.
# You have a new egg... it hatched!
# You can get_stats(), see_pet(), play(), feed(), clean().
```

The blueprint will be saved at the location resolved by `tools::R_user_dir("tamRgo", "data")`. You can always `release()` your pet into the wild, which will delete the blueprint file. 

So, you have a new pet. Now what? The hint suggests to check the stats, so let's do that.

```{r eval=FALSE}
get_stats()
# Characteristics
#   Name:    BERTHA
#   Species: Z
#   Age:     0
#   Level:   0 (newborn)
# Status
#   Happy:   ■■■□□  
#   Hungry:  ■■■□□  
#   Dirty:   □□□□□  
```

You can see some characteristics and statuses, which I think are pretty self-explanatory.

Let's quickly check what our pet looks like with `see_pet()`. Its appearance depends on the species and the level, but newborns are pretty much a blob. It'll probably render better in your console than in your browser.

```{r eval=FALSE}
see_pet()
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
## ░░░░░░░
## ░░███░░
## ░█░█░█░
## ░█████░
## ░██░██░
## ░░███░░
## ░░░░░░░
```

## Feed

Having just been born, BERTHA is a little peckish. Let's lower that 'Hungry' value by using `feed()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
feed()
# 'Hungry' status value is now 2/5
```

See how the 'Hungry' counter decreased by 1?

```{r eval=FALSE}
get_stats()
# Characteristics
#   Name:    BERTHA
#   Species: Z
#   Age:     0
#   Level:   0 (newborn)
# Status
#   Happy:   ■■■□□  
#   Hungry:  ■■□□□  
#   Dirty:   □□□□□  
```

## Play

You can increase the 'Happy' value with `play()`. This begins a game of 'higher or lower' with user input.

```{r eval=FALSE}
play()
# Higher or lower than 4? Type h or l: h
# Wrong! It was 1. Score: 0/5.
# Higher or lower than 1? Type h or l: h
# Correct! It was 8. Score: 1/5.
# Higher or lower than 4? Type h or l: h
# Correct! It was 6. Score: 2/5.
# Higher or lower than 6? Type h or l: l
# Correct! It was 5. Score: 3/5.
# Higher or lower than 7? Type h or l: l
# Wrong! It was 10. Score: 3/5.
# Result: you scored 3/5!
# 'Happy' status value is now 4/5
```

Rumour has it that the game is easier under some circumstances and that a higher score is better for your pet's wellbeing.

## Clean

Eventually your pet will become 'dirty' and you'll need to `clean()` it.

```{r eval=FALSE}
see_pet()
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
## ░░░░░░░
## ░░███░░
## ░█░█░█░
## ░█████░
## ░██░██░
## ░░███░░
## ░░░░░░░
## ░░░░░░░
## ░░░█░░░
## ░░███░░  
## ░█████░ 
## ░░░░░░░
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
clean()
# 'Dirty' status value is now 0/5
```

## It lives!

Maybe you forget about your pet. You remember it exists three days later. From _any_ R session on your computer you can check the stats.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Characteristics
#   Name:    BERTHA
#   Species: Z
#   Age:     5
#   Level:   2 (youngling)
# Status
#   Happy:   □□□□□ !
#   Hungry:  ■■■■■ !
#   Dirty:   ■■■■■ !
```

Whoops, looks like it's pretty unhappy, pretty hungry and pretty dirty.

You should look after your pet. Apparently there's a chance it might become... 'unalive'. Rumour has it that good owners have longer-living pets...

Regardless, BERTHA has now reached level 2. What does he look like now?

```{r eval=FALSE}
see_pet()
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
## ░░░░░░░░░░
## ░░█░░░░█░░
## ░░░█░░█░░░
## ░░██████░░
## ░░█░██░█░░
## ░░██████░░
## ░███░░███░
## ░░██████░░
## ░░█░░░░█░░
## ░░░░░░░░░░

## ░░░█░░░
## ░░███░░

```

Erm, cool antennae, bro. Totally distracts from the mess.

# Under the shell

The underlying logic is pretty simple. I don't want to give away too many spoilers, but it's worth explaining some of the main components a bit.

## Blueprint

The whole system is dependent on a 'blueprint' file, which is what gets stored at the `tools::R_user_dir()` location. It's a list object with elements like the pet's name, species (randomly generated), 'date of birth', accumulated XP, status values (happy, hungry, dirty) and some other things.

The blueprint is read and updated whenever you use a function from {tamRgo}. The current datetime is compared to the datetime of last interaction (stored in the blueprint) and the difference is used to calculate things like the pet's age, XP accumulation and level and status values.

This gives the impression that the pet has been 'alive' on the player's machine while they've been away. A trick![^trick]

## Experience system

The main goal is to accumulate XP and keep your pet alive. XP:

* is accumulated passively every hour
* is gained from the minigame in `play()`, where a higher score means more XP
* will result in the pet levelling up when certain thresholds have been met, which alters their appearance

At a certain point, the pet will become 'unalive'[^dead]. The chance of this happening is based on the pet's accumulated XP. Basically:

* XP is 'frozen' at a certain age and the value is stored in the blueprint
* the chance of becoming unalive is tied to the frozen XP value, where more XP means a lower chance
* the number of days since the XP was frozen is used as a multiplier, so the chance of becoming unalive increases with time

The current XP count is stored in the blueprint, but is hidden from the user. This moves focus away from tracking and improving a single number and hopefully towards a more general goal of keeping your pet happy, well-fed and clean.

## Sprites

There are character 'sprites' that change with age and species (see the image at the top of this post). The sprite for a newborn, mature and unalive pet are the same regardless of species, but the other levels are dependent on whether the pet is species X, Y or Z. Of course, these are pixellated to mimic the original _Tamagotchi_ style.

The sprites are called by `see_pet()` as binary matrices of filled and unfilled 'pixels'. I wrote the package [{pixeltrix}](https://github.com/matt-dray/pixeltrix), which I wrote about in [my last blog post](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/09/24/pixeltrix/) for a simple interactive way to design sprites by turning pixels 'on' and 'off' in a plotting window. Here's a preview of an original Tamgotchi character 

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2022-09-24-pixeltrix_files/pixeltrix.gif" alt="Gif of RStudio window. The console is running the code pixeltrix::click_pixels(6, 7, 3) and a plot appears with a 6 by 7 square grid. Some squares are clicked, changing them to light grey. A second click turns them dark grey. Eventually a little square character with a face is created. A matrix encoded the image is shown in the console when the escape key is pressed." width="100%"/>
</div>

# Practical yolk

It's not feature complete, lol[^others]. To improve it, I could:

* animate the pixel graphics
* allow blueprints to be transferred between machines, so your pet can live across multiple devices[^gist]
* add a battle system like _Digimon_
* make the `play()` minigame actually fun and so it grants more XP for greater skill
* make more meaningful use of 'hungry' and 'dirty' statuses, perhaps include a hidden HP gauge that is reduced when these statuses are at their maximum for an extended period

The main point of this toy was for me to work out how to store data on a user's machine. Should you actually do that? It depends. Can you use it in a silly R package for purposes of fun? Well, yes, if you ask me.

You can probably think of other ways to use `tools::R_user_dir()` for games in R, particularly for 'save states. Let me know when you've made a new triple-A game for R and I'll add it to [the list](https://github.com/matt-dray/awesome-r-games).

[^explain]: Oh, wait, I have to explain myself? Look no further than [Mike Cheng's rstudio::conf22 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPotWAJnE_s) or the [awesome-r-games list](https://github.com/matt-dray/awesome-r-games). I've written toys like  [{ActionSquirrel}](https://github.com/matt-dray/ActionSquirrel), [{safar6}](https://github.com/matt-dray/safar6), [{potato}](https://github.com/matt-dray/potato) and [{r.oguelike}](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike).
[^tama]: For the benefit of youths, [a _Tamagotchi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) was (is!) a little physical device that contains a 'digital pet', made popular in the late 90s. They have a little screen and physical buttons so you can see your pet and interact with it. Play with it, feed it, even reprimand it.
[^rappdirs]: You may be familiar with [{rappdirs}](https://rappdirs.r-lib.org/), a package that helps you find directories. `tools::R_user_dir()` is nice because it's built into R, so no dependency is required.
[^dead]: A euphemism to protect the sensitive.
[^fosstodon]: If you do try and @ me, then you can now do it over at [@mattdray@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@mattdray).
[^trick]: _Illusions, Michael._
[^gist]: In fact, my initial approach to {tamRgo} was to store blueprints remotely in [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com/). The plus-side is that this could (in theory) let you battle other pets by reading their blueprints from a URL. The downside is the overhead of requiring a GitHub account and API access. If you want, you can [peruse the {tamRgo} GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo/tree/65301b8f362ec047555217611d13af79e4f00020) just before I moved from Gist-based to local blueprints.
[^others]: Meanwhile, VS Code users can check out [Anthony Shaw's _VS Code Pets_](https://tonybaloney.github.io/vscode-pets/) to have a little cat or dog (or Clippy!) in their IDE. There's also a lot of digital-pet implementations on various blogs and YouTube, but it was [SquidGodDev's _Pocket Pets_ for the Playdate](https://youtu.be/KUjVfoLtHwc) that really egged me on.
