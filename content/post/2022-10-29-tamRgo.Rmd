# tl;dr

I've written [the concept R package {tamRgo}](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo) to simulate a persistent digital pet in your R console. Silliest, best thing I've ever made?

# GameRs

R is a game engine; don't @ me.[^explain] As such, R has the ability to [keep a persistent save state](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#sec-data-persistent).

How? R developers can use [`tools::R_user_dir()`](https://rdrr.io/r/tools/userdir.html) to generate a platform-independent path to a local directory for storing user-specific data.[^rappdirs]

Obviously I've used this to make a concept R package: [{tamRgo}](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo). It saves locally a 'blueprint' for a  [_Tamgotchi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi)-like pet[^tama]. The blueprint is read and updated in the background while you interact with your pet in the R console.

_Tamago_ (egg) + _uotchi_ ('watch') = Tamagotchi. _Tamago_ + R = {tamRgo}.

# Demo

## Install

You can install the package [from GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo) using the {remotes} package. There's also [an accompanying website](https://matt-dray.github.io/tamRgo/) to read the documentation online.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("tamRgo")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/tamRgo")
library(tamRgo)
```

It has no package dependencies, but you'll need to be running a version of R greater than 4.0.

Of course, it's just a toy to demonstrate a concept. I've built out a bit of a 'game loop', but it's just for fun and the code is not optimised. [Suggestions and code contributions always welcome](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo/issues).

## Lay an egg

To begin, you'll need to generate a new pet by laying an egg. You'll be asked to confirm it's okay to save a blueprint file onto your computer, which is tiny list object stored as RDS.

```{r eval=FALSE}
> lay_egg(pet_name = "KEVIN")
# Save pet blueprint? y/n: y
# Saved pet blueprint.
# You have a new egg... it hatched!
# You can get_stats(), see_pet(), play(), feed(), clean().
```

You are free to destroy this file by navigating to the path resolved by `tools::R_user_dir("tamRgo", "data")` or, you can `release()` your pet into the wild. 

So, you have a new pet. Now what? The hint suggests to check the stats, so let's do that.

```{r eval=FALSE}
get_stats()
# Characteristics
#   Name:    KEVIN
#   Species: Z
#   Age:     0
#   Level:   0 (newborn)
# Status
#   Happy:   ■■■□□  
#   Hungry:  ■■■□□  
#   Dirty:   □□□□□  
```

You can see some characteristics and statuses. 'Name' is obvious; 'Species' is generated randomly; 'Age' is days since the 'birth' date; 'Level' relates to the amount of experience that's been accumulated. 'Happy', 'Hungry' and 'Dirty' are status values that change over time and can be adjusted with the functions `play()`, `feed()` and `clean()`, respectively.

Let's quickly check what our pet looks like with `see_pet()`. It's appearance depends on the species and the level.

```{r eval=FALSE}
see_pet()
#       
#  ███  
# █ █ █ 
# █████ 
# ██ ██ 
#  ███  
#       
```

## Feed

Having just been born, KEVIN is a little peckish. Let's lower that 'Hungry' value by using `feed()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
feed()
# 'Hungry' status value is now 2/5
```

See how the 'Hungry' counter decreased by 1?

```{r eval=FALSE}
get_stats()
# Characteristics
#   Name:    KEVIN
#   Species: Z
#   Age:     0
#   Level:   0 (newborn)
# Status
#   Happy:   ■■■□□  
#   Hungry:  ■■□□□  
#   Dirty:   □□□□□  
```

## Play

You can increase the 'Happy' value with `play()`. This begins a game of 'higher or lower' with user input.

```{r eval=FALSE}
play()
# The number is 4. Higher or lower? Type 'H' or 'L': H
# Wrong! It was 1. Score: 0/5.
# The number is 1. Higher or lower? Type 'H' or 'L': H
# Correct! It was 8. Score: 1/5.
# The number is 4. Higher or lower? Type 'H' or 'L': H
# Correct! It was 6. Score: 2/5.
# The number is 6. Higher or lower? Type 'H' or 'L': L
# Correct! It was 5. Score: 3/5.
# The number is 7. Higher or lower? Type 'H' or 'L': L
# Wrong! It was 10. Score: 3/5.
# Result: you scored 3/5!
# 'Happy' status value is now 4/5
```

Rumour has it that the game is easier under some circumstances and that a higher score is better for your pet's wellbeing.

## Clean

Eventually your pet will become 'dirty' and you'll need to `clean()` it.

```{r eval=FALSE}
see_pet()
#       
#  ███  
# █ █ █ 
# █████ 
# ██ ██ 
#  ███  
#       
#       
#   █   
#  ███  
# █████ 
#       
clean()
# 'Dirty' status value is now 0/5
```

Your pet will level up over time (how?) and it's appearance will change.

## It lives!

Maybe you forget about your pet. You remember it exists three days later. From _any_ R session on your computer you can check the stats.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Characteristics
#   Name:    KEVIN
#   Species: Z
#   Age:     5
#   Level:   2 (youngling)
# Status
#   Happy:   □□□□□ !
#   Hungry:  ■■■■■ !
#   Dirty:   ■■■■■ !
```

Whoops, looks like it's pretty unhappy, pretty hungry and pretty dirty.

You should look after your pet. Apparently there's a chance it might become... 'unalive'. Rumour has it that god owners have longer-living pets...

Regardless, KEVIN has now reached level 2. What does he look like now?

```{r eval=FALSE}
see_pet()
#          
#  █    █  
#   █  █   
#  ██████  
#  █ ██ █  
#  ██████  
# ███  ███ 
#  ██████  
#  █    █  
#          
#       
#   █   
#  ███  
# █████ 
#       
```

Cool antennae, bro. Might need to given him a clean.

# Under the hood

The underlying 'engine for the game is very simple. I don't want to give away too many spoilers, but it's worth explaining some of the main components a bit.

## Blueprint

The whole system is dependent on a 'blueprint' file, which is what gets stored at the `tools::R_user_dir()` location. It's a list object with elements like the pet's name, species (randomly generated), 'date of birth', accumulated XP, status values (happy, hungry, dirty) and some other things.

The blueprint is read and updated whenever you use a function from {tamRgo}. The current datetime is compared to the datetime of last interaction (stored in the blueprint) and the difference is used to calculate things like the pet's age, XP accumulation and level and status values.

This gives the impression that the pet has been 'alive' on the player's machine while they've been away. A trick!

## Experience system

The main goal is to accumulate XP and keep your pet alive. XP:

* is accumulated passively every hour
* gained from the minigame in `play()`, where a higher score means more XP
* will result in the pet levelling up when certain thresholds have been met, which alters their appearance

At a certain point, the pet will become 'unalive'.[^dead] The chance of this happening is based on the pet's accumulated XP. Basically:

* XP is 'frozen' at a certain age and this value is stored in the blueprint
* the chance of becoming unalive is tied to the frozen XP value, where more XP means a lower chance
* the number of days since the XP was frozen is used as a multiplier, so the chance of becoming unalive increases with time

The current XP count is stored in the blueprint, but is hidden from the user. This moves focus away from tracking and improving a single number and hopefully towards a more general goal of keeping your pet happy, well-fed and clean.

## Sprites

There are character 'sprites' that change with age and species. The sprite for a newborn, mature and unalive pet are the same regardless of species, but the other levels are dependent on whether the pet is species X, Y or Z. Of course, these are pixellated to mimic the original _Tamagotchi_ style.

The sprites are stored as binary matrices where 1 indicates a filled 'pixel' and zero an empty pixel. To make it easy to create these matrices, I wrote the package [{pixeltrix}](https://github.com/matt-dray/pixeltrix), which I wrote about in [my last blog post](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/09/24/pixeltrix/). It provides an interactive way to design sprites by turning pixels 'on' and 'off' in a plotting window, which returns a matrix. When `see_pet()` is called, the appropriate matrix is plotted row-by-row to the console.

# Improvements

What else would I do to improve this? Plenty, including:

* animated pixel graphics
* the ability to transfer a blueprint between machines, so your pet can live across multiple devices
* a battle system like _Digimon_
* a more fun minigame in `play()` that will grant more XP with greater skill
* more meaningful use of 'hungry' and 'dirty' statuses, perhaps a hidden HP gauge that is reduced when these statuses are at their maximum for an extended period

My initial approach to {tamRgo} was to store blueprints remotely in [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com/)[^gist]. The plus-side is that you could battle other pets by reading their blueprints from a URL. The downside is the overhead of requiring a GitHub account and API access. It's more fun if the full blueprint is obscured from the player.

# So

So you can store bits of persistent data on your users' machines. Should you? Maybe.

Can you use it in a concept R package to help store a small list for purposes of fun? Well, yes, if you ask me.

You can probably think of other ways to use `tools::R_user_dir()` for games in R. Maybe you could have a 'save state' that can be recalled each time a game is played.

[^explain]: Oh, wait, I have to explain myself? Look no further than [Mike Cheng's rstudio::conf22 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPotWAJnE_s) or the [awesome-r-games list](https://github.com/matt-dray/awesome-r-games). I've written toys like  [{ActionSquirrel}](https://github.com/matt-dray/ActionSquirrel), [{safar6}](https://github.com/matt-dray/safar6) and [{r.oguelike}](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike).
[^tama]: For the benefit of youths, [a _Tamagotchi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) was (is!) a little physical device that contains a 'digital pet', made popular in the late 90s. They have a little screen and physical buttons so you can see your pet and interact with it. Play with it, feed it, even reprimand it.
[^rappdirs]: You may be familiar with [{rappdirs}](https://rappdirs.r-lib.org/), a package that helps you find directories. `tools::R_user_dir()` is nice because it's built into R, so no dependency is required.
[^dead]: A euphemism to protect the sensitive.
[^gist]: You can [peruse the GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo/tree/65301b8f362ec047555217611d13af79e4f00020) just before I moved from Gist-based to local blueprints.
