# Deer-vehicle collisions

Deer roam Scotland. So do humans. This is a problem when vehicles travel along roads frequented by deer.

Regardless of whether you think deer have [ecological benefits or are a nuisance](https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/land-and-sea-management/managing-wildlife/managing-deer/deer-management-general-guidance/deer-impacts), this is clearly a dangerous situation.

Further information is available from [Scottish Natural Heritage](https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/land-and-sea-management/managing-wildlife/managing-deer/deer-vehicle-collisions) (SNH).

# Open data

Fortunately, [The National Deer-Vehicle Collisions Project](http://www.deercollisions.co.uk/), administered by [The Deer Initiative](http://www.thedeerinitiative.co.uk/), has been monitoring data on deer-vehicle collisions in the UK.

I found the data when skimming through [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/838b88d8-7509-435c-9649-90f1881b5ad7/deer-vehicle-collisions) (a classic weekend activity for all the family). It links to the [SNH Natural Spaces site](https://gateway.snh.gov.uk/natural-spaces/dataset.jsp?dsid=DVC) where you can download the data as shapefile, GML or KML under the [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)

# A simple Shiny app

The app is [live on the internet at mattdray.shinyapps.io/scot-deer-collisions/](https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/scot-deer-collisions/).

The [code for the app is available on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/scot-deer-collisions). You can also [download the cleaned data in CSV or RDS format](https://github.com/matt-dray/scot-deer-collisions/tree/master/data).

It's built with:

* Shinydashboard for a nice layout and value boxes
* Leaflet for the interactive map
* DT for the interactive datatable
