Xaringan is an R implementation of remark.js for slide creation

You are encouraged to contribute some CSS to the package so more themes are available out of the box.

My organisation uses Google Slides, so R content has to be copy-pasted. I wanted a more reproducible method that would allow for code to be run in situ.

I tweaked the basic Xaringan CSS to replicate my organisation's slide template.

I could have subitted the CSS files as theme, but the R Markdown template is as crucial as the CSS.

This is because there's a specific acceptable set of slide types that must be used if the design principles of the original design are to be followed correctly:

* open and close
* heading
* text
* annotation

You shouldn't use the default title slide that's created from the YAML; `seal: false` must be set. 

I don't want people to go beyond these restrictions.

So how can the CSS and RMarkdown template be delivered to people?

You can bundle them into a package. You need a specific repo structure to do this. This is all explained in the [Document Templates](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/document-templates.html) chapter of the '[R Markdown: a Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)' book by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/), [JJ Allaire](https://github.com/jjallaire) and [Garrett Grolemund](https://twitter.com/StatGarrett).

The template will appear in the 'from template' section of the new RMarkdown window. Selecting it will open the RMarkdown template with a demonstration of each slide type.
