<div id="tldr" class="section level1">
<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>I spoke at the UK Government Data Science Festival about the R package <a href="">{targets}</a> for workflow reproducibility by <a href="">Will Landau</a>.</p>

<div id="slides" class="section level1">
<h1>Slides</h1>
<p>You can see the slides <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/targets-dsfest/#1">in a dedicated browser window</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/targets-dsfest">visit the source</a>.</p>
<p>Press <kbd>P</kbd> for presenter notes, <kbd>O</kbd> for a slide overview and <kbd>F</kbd> for fullscreen.</p>

<div id="targets" class="section level1">
<h1>{targets}</h1>
<p>{targets} ‘remembers’ the relationships between objects in your workflow. When you update your analysis, {targets} makes sure that only the impacted objects are re-run. This means you don’t have to recreate everything from scratch each time.</p>

<div id="butdrake" class="section level1">
<h1>But…{drake}?</h1>
<p>You may have noticed I cunningly plagiarised myself by re-using slides from <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/01/31/reprobioinformatics/">a presentation to Bioinformatics London</a> in January 2020.</p>
<p>The difference is that that presentation was about {drake}, another workflow reproducibility package by Will Landau. So what’s the difference between the two packages?</p>
