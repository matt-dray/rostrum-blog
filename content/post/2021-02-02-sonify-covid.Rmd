# tl;dr

I used [the {sonify} package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sonify) in R to represent a year of [the UK's COVID-19 data](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) as audio. You can [jump straight to the audio](#sonified).

# Listen to your data

I watched an excellent talk at the [rstudio::global(2021)](https://resources.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/) conference by [JooYoung Seo](https://twitter.com/seo_jooyoung) titled 'Accessible Data Science Beyond Visual Models: Non-Visual Interactions with R and RStudio Packages'. You can access [the video](https://resources.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/accessible-data-science-beyond-visual-models-non-visual-interactions-with-r-and-rstudio-packages/) or [his blog](https://jooyoungseo.com/post/ds4blind/) on the subject.

In the talk he mentioned [the {sonify} package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sonify) for R, which lets you represent data with sound rather than with visuals. For example, values of x and y that increase linearly can be represented by a sound that rises in pitch.

I wondered: given it's been a year, what would COVID-19 data sound like? 

# COVID-19 data

GOV.UK, the UK government's website, has [a 'daily dashboard'](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) of COVID-19 statistics. There are four prominent statistics:

1. [Cases](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases) (people tested positive)
1. [Deaths](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths) (deaths within 28 days of a positive test)
1. [Healthcare](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare) (patients admitted to hospital)
1. [Testing](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/testing) (virus tests conducted)

The [downloads page](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download) contains these data and more, both UK-wide and at local levels. This post isn't an analysis, but I implore you to take a look a the data yourself and [read the details](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/about-data).

Helpfully, you can generate a permanent link from which to fetch data[^fair]. Here I'm grabbing the UK-wide stats mentioned above:

```{r}
data <- read.csv(
  paste0(
    "https://api.coronavirus.data.gov.uk/v2/data",
    "?areaType=overview", # UK wide
    "&metric=newCasesBySpecimenDate",  # cases
    "&metric=newDeaths28DaysByDeathDate",  # deaths
    "&metric=newAdmissions",  # healthcare
    "&metric=newVirusTests",  # testing
    "&format=csv"  # CSV output
  ),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

I'll apply some minor cleaning to order by date and isolate the first 365 days, which takes us to 28 January 2021.

```{r}
data <- data[order(data$date), ]  # order by date
data <- data[1:365, ]  # first year
range(data$date)
```

I read this into R as a `data.frame` object with one row per day.

```{r}
str(data)
```

How quickly a year goes.

# AV functions

## Audio

To simplify things, I've written a function using `sonify::sonify()` to generate a five-second audio clip representing a COVID-19 variable over time. It uses `tuneR::writeWav()` to write each file.

```{r}
sonify_covid <- function(y, out_dir = "~/Desktop") {

    tuneR::writeWave(
      sonify::sonify(
        x = as.Date(data$date), y = data[[y]],
        play = FALSE
      ),
      file.path(out_dir, paste0(y, ".wav"))
    )
  
}
```

I ran this function over each variable in the dataset, like `sonify_covid(newAdmissions)`, to write the data to my machine. I've embedded each clip alongside the plots in the sections below. The audio is in stereo, so you'll hear the sound move from left to right as you listen.

## Visual

The plots are going to be intentionally sparse because the focus of the post is the _sound_ the data make. This function takes a COVID-19 variable from our dataset and plots it over time with {gpplot2}.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

plot_covid <- function(y) {

  ggplot() +
    geom_point(
      aes(as.Date(data$date), data[[y]] / 1000),
      shape = 21
    ) +
    labs(
      caption = "Data: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/",
      x = "Date", y = "Count (thousands)"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
  
}
```

I've hidden the code in the section below, but this function generates the plots we want like `plot_covid(newAdmissions)`.

If you have trouble playing any of the embedded audio clips, you can also access them as [a playlist on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-860586053/sets/a-year-of-covid-19-data-sonified).

## Cases

[People who have tested positive](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases).

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/sonify-covid/newCasesBySpecimenDate.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.alt="Scatter chart of COVID-19 cases over time. There's a small bump to about 5000 cases per day in early April 2020 and then a peak around 30,000 cases in November, before a large spike to around 80,000 cases at the start of 2021."}
plot_covid("newCasesBySpecimenDate")
```

## Death

[Deaths within 28 days of a positive test](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths).

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/sonify-covid/newDeaths28DaysByDeathDate.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.alt="Scatter chart of COVID-19 deaths over time. There's a spike at 1000 cases at the start of April 2020, before it comes back down to almost zero by September, before rising to 500 before December, then spiking at 1500 at the start of 2021."}
plot_covid("newDeaths28DaysByDeathDate")
```

## Healthcare

[Patients admitted to hospital](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/healthcare).

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/sonify-covid/newAdmissions.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.alt="Scatter chart of COVID-19 hospital admissions over time. There's a spike at 3500 cases at the start of April 2020, before it comes back down to almost zero by September, before rising to 2000 before December, then spiking at 4500 at the start of 2021."}
plot_covid("newAdmissions")
```

## Testing

[Virus tests conducted](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/testing).

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/sonify-covid/newVirusTests.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.alt="Scatter chart of COVID-19 tests over time. The value climbs from zero at the end of April 2020 to nearly 800 by the end of January 2021."}
plot_covid("newVirusTests")
```

# Coda

Sonification has been used for a variety of applications during the pandemic as an alternate means of conveying the data. 

For example, Jan Willem Tulp has [created a page that 'dings' each time there's a new case](https://covidspreadingrates.org/) around the world. For something more complex, Mark D. Temple has [published in the BMC Bioinformatics journal](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03760-7) a paper about sonifying the COVID-19 genome (!). Meanwhile, Pedro Pereira Sarmento has [sonified data to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on air pollution](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/sonification-of-air-pollution-data-in-times-of-covid-19/).

I'm probably not the first to sonify coronavirus data in this way, and probably not even the first to do it with R, but it seemed a good time to take a look (listen?) back on things. I'm interested to hear more about what approaches others have taken.
