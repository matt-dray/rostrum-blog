<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Dearest ma and pa,</p>
<p>The food here is okay. Mostly I’ve been setting up <a href="https://www.matt-dray.com/">a single-page personal site</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/seankross/postcards">{postcards}</a> package for R, deploying it with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and setting up a custom domain with <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>. More rain is forecast for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Wish you were here,</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

<div id="domain-driven-development" class="section level1">
<h1>Domain-driven development</h1>
<p>A hobby of mine is to look for funny domain names and to not buy them.</p>
<p>Eventually I realised that <a href="https://www.matt-dray.com"><code>matt-dray.com</code></a> wasn’t taken, so I figured I might as well squat it and do something pseudo-useful with it.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Yes, I could write some HTML<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and CSS to make a complicated shrine to self-absorption, but why bother trying to center divs when <a href="https://twitter.com/seankross">Sean Kross</a> has just announced <a href="https://github.com/seankross/postcards">the {postcards} R package</a> to create nice, minimal landing pages?</p>
<p>This post is a short self-reminder of how to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Generate a webpage with {postcards}</li>
<li>Host it with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></li>
<li>Point to it with a custom domain from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This post isn’t about the tubes and wires of the internet. It’s more the how than the why.</p>
</div>
<div id="write-a-postcard" class="section level1">
<h1>Write a postcard</h1>
<p>{postcards} provides some R Markdown templates that contain space for a photo, a mini-bio and some buttons to link out to your profiles elsewhere. See <a href="https://github.com/seankross/postcards/blob/main/README.md">the package’s readme</a> for examples.</p>
<p>You can install the development version from GitHub:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remotes::install_github(&quot;seankross/postcards&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I generated an R Markdown file with <a href="https://seankross.com/postcards-templates/jolla/">the ‘Jolla’ template</a> using the following line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rmarkdown::draft(&quot;index.Rmd&quot;, &quot;Jolla&quot;, package = &quot;postcards&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Note that the file is called <code>index.Rmd</code> and will thus render to <code>index.html</code>. This is the default file that gets read when a site is visited.</p>
<p>In the YAML header of the template you can specify a <code>title</code>, which is likely to be your name; the <code>output</code> format, which is the name for our chosen {postcards} template; <code>links</code>, where you specify the wording and underlying links for the page’s buttons; <code>image</code> for your bokeh-rich professional headshot and <code>favicon</code> for the little image that will appear alongside your page title in a browser tab.</p>

<p>You can then write your mini bio in the body text of the document. I garnished mine with emoji via <a href="https://github.com/hadley/emo">Hadley Wickham’s {emo} package</a>.</p>
<p>The {postcards} templates are ready to go out of the box but you can still tinker with the style. I decided to pull in a font, <a href="https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans">Fantasque Sans Mono by Jany Belluz</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and put a CSS chunk in the R Markdown to specify it.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">

</div>
<p>The content and design of my page may change at any time, but I purposefully want it to be minimal and have a clean and simple appearance. The {postcards} package is also in development, so I look forward to testing out any new features that appear in future.</p>
</div>
<div id="pop-it-in-the-post" class="section level1">
<h1>Pop it in the post</h1>
<p>You could put your in a GitHub repo and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages">serve it with GitHub Pages</a> if you want. Upside: it’s free. Downside: your URL will be in the form <code>username.github.io/your-postcard-repo</code>, which isn’t particularly sleek.</p>
<p>Instead you could use a free service like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to deploy a site from a GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repo and set up a custom domain to point at it. I’ve had prior success with Netlify for this blog, so that’s why I’m using it here.</p>
<p>To set up my page, I signed into Netlify and I:</p>
<ul>
<li>clicked the ‘New site from Git’ button</li>
<li>clicked ‘GitHub’ in ‘1. Connect to Git provider’, because that’s where <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/postcard">my {postcards} repo</a> is stored</li>
<li>selected my <code>github.com/matt-dray/postcard/</code> repo in ‘2. Pick a repository’ after authorising Netlify to connect to to it</li>
<li>left the ‘build command’ empty in step ‘3. Build options and deploy!’ and set the ‘publish directory’ to ‘/’ (because I want to serve <code>index.html</code> from the root of the repo)</li>
<li>clicked ‘deploy site’</li>
</ul>
<p>For more on these steps, including screenshots, see <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/">Netlify’s step-by-step guidance on deploying static and single-page sites</a>.</p>
<p>Netlify takes a moment to build and serve the site after you click ‘deploy site’. It’s served automatically from a URL in the form <code>random-name.netlify.app</code><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> but, as mentioned, you can configure a privately-owned domain name instead.</p>
</div>
<div id="address-it-properly" class="section level1">
<h1>Address it properly</h1>
<p>There’s a whole bunch of domain-name providers. I’m focusing here on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, which is what I used to for this blog. After buying a domain, there’s a little bit of back-and-forth required between Netlify and Namecheap.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In your Namecheap account, click the ‘Manage’ button for your domain and set the dropdown in the ‘Nameservers’ section to ‘Custom DNS’</li>
<li>In your Namecheap account, click ‘Set up a custom domain’, type it in and confirm</li>
<li>Click ‘Set up Netlify DNS’ alongside the domain and click through until you’re provided a handful of nameserver strings</li>
<li>Back on Namecheap, copy-paste each of these into the ‘Nameservers’ section from step 1 and click the check mark to confirm</li>
<li>Wait.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’ll take a short while, but there’ll be a sort of high-five between your domain and your site and then it’ll be ready for viewing.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.blog.ezekielekunola.com/setting-up-domain-with-namecheap-and-netlify">Ezekiel Ekunola’s excellent blog post for a more thorough guide, which includes screenshots</a>.</p>
<p>Note also that Netlify provides HTTPS for free too, which is <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/https-ssl/#certificate-service-types">good for a number of reasons</a>, though the certificate can take a few hours to generate.</p>
<p>You can check your domain settings in Netlify at any time by clicking the site name in your account and then clicking the ‘Domain settings’ button.</p>

<p>So this is a relatively quick way of generating up a single-page site with {postcards}; hosting the source on GitHub; deploying it with Netlify; and serving it via a custom domain bought from from Namecheap.</p>
<p>This seems to work fine for me for now. Let me know if you have a better approach to generating and deploying simple single-page sites.</p>
