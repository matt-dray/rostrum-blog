# tl;dr

[The {keypress} R package by Gábor Csárdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/keypress) records input from a simple keyboard-button press. You can use this to control games, like the ones in [the tiny {hokey} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/hokey).

# Whaddup gameRs?

I've made some silly games in R using [the {R6} package](https://r6.r-lib.org/index.html) for [encapsulated OOP](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html). For example:

* {ActionSquirrel} a 2D action-adventure game ([blog](the accompanying blog post), [source](https://github.com/matt-dray/ActionSquirrel))
* {safar6} a text-based recreation of _Pokémon_'s Safari Zone ([blog](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/01/04/safar6/), [source](https://github.com/matt-dray/safar6))
* an 'Automatic Bell Dispenser' to mimics the cash machine used in _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_ ([blog](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/04/04/repaying-tom-nook-with-r6/))

In {ActionSquirrel} you move a character around a 2D grid. Problem (kinda): to go up you type `x$move("up")`, which means 'apply the `move` method to the previously-initialised R6 object called `x`, and supply to the `where` argument the direction `"up"`'. A bit long-winded, eh?

It would be more natural to provide a single keyboard input to a game scenario, so a left-arrow press moves the player to the left, right? Right.[^right]

# Record inputs

Sure, R's `readline()` can take user input, but you would literally have to type <kbd>l</kbd>, <kbd>e</kbd>, <kbd>f</kbd>, <kbd>t</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd>, because the function doesn't recognise key presses directly.

This is where [Gábor Csárdi's {keypress} package](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/keypress) comes in. It accepts a single button press from the keyboard, including the arrow keys. It's available on CRAN:

```{r install}
install.packages("keypress")
key <- keypress::keypress()  # up arrow pressed
key
```

```
"up"
```

{keypress} works in the terminal but doesn't work everywhere, such as RStudio. Use `keypress::has_keypress_support()` to see if it's supported by the console you're using. See the [package README](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/keypress/blob/x/README.md) for details of the platforms supported and the keys that are accepted as input.

# Minigames

I thought I'd try out with {keypress} with three tiny interactive games, which I've bundled into [a pico package](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/04/18/pico-pkg/)[^pico] called [{hokey}](https://github.com/matt-dray/hokey). 

```{r}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/hokey")
```

Each one takes a keypress input from `keypress::keypress()` to affect the game, which is just a bunch of `if` or `while` statements, basically. You can [see the functions in the {hokey} package itself](https://github.com/matt-dray/hokey/blob/main/R/functions.R), if you're a nerd.[^nerd]

The games in order of complexity:

1. `type()`, a test of typing skills
2. `adventure()`, a 2D side-scrollling adventure
3. `battle()`, a clicker-style monster smasher

These aren't properly documented ot tested or anything. They're just for demo's sake. 

The rest of this post describes the games with a dash of dry humour.

## 1. Typing test

How fast you can you type randomly-selected letters?

In the `type()` game a countdown will begin and then you'll be prompted to type one letter at a time, the total number of which can be controlled with the `n` argument.

Here's what a completed game might look like, where each letter is revealed sequentially after typing the previous one.

```{r type-demo}
hokey::type(n = 5)
```

```
3... 2... 1... Go!
Press 'r'! Hit!
Press 'o'! Hit!
Press 'f'! Hit!
Press 'l'! 'h'? Miss!
Press 'z'! Hit!
End! 4/5 in 5.403 seconds.
```
Yes, three decimal places in the elapsed time so that people can be more easily ranked on [speedruns.com](https://www.speedrun.com/).

## 2. An adventure

You've played 2D games (e.g. Mario). You've played 2.5D games (e.g. Mario). You've played 3D games (e.g. Mario).

You're thinking the future is four-dimensional Mario. But you're wrong.

Instead, `hokey::adventure()` explores the full power of moving along a one-dimensional line.

Take control of the hero. Which is a dot. Move around the overworld. Which is a line. Simulate the lustrous points of Lineland from [Edwin A Abbott's Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland)!

```{r adventure-demo}
hokey::adventure(len = 10)
```
```
Press left/right arrow keys
--.------- 
```

Below is a demo of what happens if you start the game and travel to the dangerous lands of the west (two left-key presses, resulting in you being bumped back on course), before heading for the utopian kingdom in the east (multiple right-key presses).

The symbol to the right of the line explains what's happened (`<` is left, `>` is right, `x` is an illegal move, `!` is a win).

```
Press left/right arrow keys
--.------- 
-.-------- < 
.--------- x 
-.-------- > 
--.------- > 
---.------ > 
----.----- > 
-----.---- > 
------.--- > 
-------.-- > 
--------.- > 
---------. ! 
```

Such graphics! Such dimensions!

## 3. A clicker

Ever heard of [Cookie Clicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker)? It's a game where you click. A cookie. A whole bunch of times. Like, seriously, a whole bunch of times. Why? To _win_, of course.

Here instead is a 'presser', where where you tap keys to vanquish randomised foes. Are there upgrades? No. Are there cool sprites? Not really. But do you click a lot? Also no, but you get to _press buttons_ a lot.

So, initiate a battle with `hokey::battle()` and you're faced with monstrous foes, who have terrifying randomised faces made of letters and symbols.

```{r cicker-demo}
hokey::battle(n = 3)
```
```
NEW FOE! { O _ O } 10 HP 
```

Smash a key (I recommend <kbd>Enter</kbd> because of its large surface area) to deplete the foe's hit points (HP) until they're defeated. Each hit is printed as a period. 

```
NEW FOE! { O _ O } 10 HP 
..........
VICTORY! { x _ x }  0 HP
```

Incrementally more powerful foes will appear!

```
NEW FOE! | - o - | 20 HP 
....................
VICTORY! | x o x |  0 HP

NEW FOE! [ ' v ' ] 30 HP 
..............................
VICTORY! [ x v x ]  0 HP
```

You know they're beaten because their eyes become crosses.

# Game over

Challenging. A test of wits. Worth your time.

All are phrases that do not sum up the games of {hokey}.

But, for me at least, I've got a better understanding of how {keypress} could be used for  games written in R, a burgeoning field in the world of R programming.[^games]

Let me know how much you enjoyed these games and how much it's going to suck to go back to your cutting-edge Neo Geo or Master System or whatever the kids are playing these days.

[^right]: Yeah, left.
[^nerd]: I'm not going to shame you, but you are 100% a nerd. Why else are you here?
[^games]: Is it though?
[^pico]: This means it's built with the absolute bare skeleton for an R package, because it's not intended for 'real' consumption. It's just for experimentation.
