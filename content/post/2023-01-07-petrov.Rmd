# tl;dr

In which I prove [Opta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opta_Sports) wrong with [my {soccercolleagues} R package](https://github.com/matt-dray/soccercolleagues). Oh wait, actually they were right. Ah, heck.

# Petrov Rescue

Basically, I hate [the Opta Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/).

The only reason is because of the noun (or whatever) they put at the end of their tweets.

Let's take a look at  [their most recent tweet](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1611735498233622534?s=20) at time of writing:

> 14 - Harry Kane has scored 14 goals in his last 14 appearances in the FA Cup, averaging a goal every 63 minutes in the competition in this period. Guarantee.

'Guarantee'. Gah.

Or [this tweet](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1611722890298404866?s=20): 

> 16 - Since his first appearance in the competition in January 2016, Leicester's Kelechi Iheanacho has scored more FA Cup goals than any other player (16). Specialist.

'Specialist'. Sigh.

Hate it.

Which is why I thought I'd prove the Opta wankers wrong by ousting a nonsense tweet.

Basically, a chance to be a hero in the niche R-user/soccer-fan community. (So [Ryo](https://ryo-n7.github.io/), [Ben](https://torvaney.github.io/) and [Tony](https://tonyelhabr.rbind.io/), yes?)

Here's the scenario: over the yuletide period (on Christmas day!) they ran [this tweet](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1607028528289030144?s=20):

> 1 - Stiliyan Petrov (@StanPetrov19) is the only player to have played in the Premier League whose name contains all the letters in the word 'Nativity'. Star.

'Star'. Ergh.

Now, I have absolutely nothing against Big Stan. He's a legend; a 'star', if you will. Captain of Aston Villa! Bulgaria! He had to retire because of leukaemia! But I don't trust Opta. I don't trust them to respect Stan.

Is the tweet true? What data are they looking at? I don't trust them. Do not take Stan's name in vain.

And you can ignore the candid dismissals by [folks like 'Smyles'](https://twitter.com/duke_smyles/status/1607052807680524289?s=20), who said of opta's tweet:

> What are we supposed to do with this information? [Picture of wryly-smiling duck.]

No! Fool! This is more important than any Opta tweet ever; I'm certain they could be wrong and I am going to uncover their shenanigans.

So I looked into it.

Of course, this is completely trivial with [my {soccercolleagues} package for R](https://github.com/matt-dray/soccercolleagues) that I wrote earlier in 2022, which is built heavily (heavily!) on [the excellent {worldfootballR} package by Jason Zivkovic](https://jaseziv.github.io/worldfootballR/), which helps fetch player data from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/).

The package's primary objective is to let you [find pairs of football players that were colleagues at some point](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/02/04/soccercolleagues/). Like: 'which current Premier League footballer has been team mates with each of the following: Kevin Phillips, Mark Viduka, Dejan Lovren, Danny Ings and Nicky Butt?'[^boring]

The package works by fetching data about footballers from every team in a given league's season since its inception.

So, aha! You cannot escape me, Opta!

Follow along. As ever, you can install the {soccercolleagues} package from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/soccercolleagues")
```

We'll also use the {tidyverse} for the lols.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(soccercolleagues)
library(tidyverse)
```

The package contains a helper function to grab every human that's played in a given league over a certain set of seasons.

So we can obviously ask for all the years of the English Premier League, which began in 1992:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Takes a while to load!
epl_players <- soccercolleagues::get_players(
  seasons = 1992:2022,
  country = "England"
)
```

Right, so we have every Premier League player from 1992 to the current season.

And now we can look for the players whose names contain the letters in 'nativity', as Opta mentioned in their tweet:

```{r eval=FALSE}
epl_players |>
  distinct(player_name) |>
  mutate(
    player_name = str_remove_all(tolower(player_name), " "),
    n_count = str_count(player_name, "n"),
    a_count = str_count(player_name, "a"),
    t_count = str_count(player_name, "t"),
    i_count = str_count(player_name, "i"),
    v_count = str_count(player_name, "v"),
    y_count = str_count(player_name, "y")
  ) |>
  filter(
    n_count >= 1 &
      a_count >= 1 &
      t_count >= 2 &
      i_count >= 2 &
      v_count >= 1 &
      y_count >= 1
  )
## # A tibble: 1 Ã— 7
##   player_name    n_count a_count t_count i_count v_count y_count
##   <chr>            <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>
## 1 stiliyanpetrov       1       1       2       2       1       1
```

Oof... they were right. He is the only one.

Wow, this humble pie is so delicious, thank you so much Opta for unintentionally spoonfeeding it to me.

To be clear: I trust Opta's data analysts. Not their social media managers. I've got my eye on you. You'll slip up one day.

And of course, regardless of outcome, I still respect Stiliyan (and other Bulgarian Premier League 'Petrovs', like cult legend [Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Petrov)).

...But wait! Opta were misnaming Stan as 'Stylian Petrov' [as late as 2012](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/169439820584714240?s=20)! Get rekt! You're missing the extra 'i' you need in 'nativity', idiots! Put respect on Siliyan's name!

'Result'.
