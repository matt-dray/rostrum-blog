# tl;dr

In which I prove wrong a tweeted [Opta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opta_Sports) football statistic, using R and Transfermarkt data. Oh wait, actually Opta were right. Ah, heck.

# Petrov Rescue

Basically, for little reason, I dislike the style of the tweets on [the Twitter feed for Opta](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/)[^sponsor] (the company who do all the football stats).

What is so outrageous? Each tweet always ends in a single, summary word that makes me cringe. 

Wait, what? Let's take a look at [their most recent tweet](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1611735498233622534?s=20) at time of writing:

> 14 - Harry Kane has scored 14 goals in his last 14 appearances in the FA Cup, averaging a goal every 63 minutes in the competition in this period. Guarantee.

'Guarantee'. Gah.

Or [this tweet](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1611722890298404866?s=20): 

> 16 - Since his first appearance in the competition in January 2016, Leicester's Kelechi Iheanacho has scored more FA Cup goals than any other player (16). Specialist.

'Specialist'. Sigh.

A completely small and pointless thing to be annoyed by, right?

But here's the scenario. Over the yuletide period (on Christmas day!) they ran [this tweet](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1607028528289030144?s=20):

> 1 - Stiliyan Petrov (@StanPetrov19) is the only player to have played in the Premier League whose name contains all the letters in the word 'Nativity'. Star.

Obviously, I have absolutely nothing against ['Big Stan'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiliyan_Petrov). He's a legend; a 'star', if you will. Captain of Aston Villa! Bulgaria! Battled leukaemia and still made it to nearly 600 games. One of the best Bulgarian/Premier League 'Petrovs', along with cult legend [Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Petrov).

But could this stat possibly be true? Surely there's at least one other player. Perhaps a window of opportunity for me to avenge my feelings of cringe?

Oh, and obviously you can ignore the candid dismissals in the tweet's replies, [for example](https://twitter.com/duke_smyles/status/1607052807680524289?s=20):

> What are we supposed to do with this information? [Picture of wryly-smiling duck.]

No, this is more important than any Opta tweet ever: what if it's... _wrong_?

# Stan in R, but not {rstan}

So I looked into it using R, of course. 

Turns out it's pretty straightforward with [the excellent {worldfootballR} package by Jason Zivkovic](https://jaseziv.github.io/worldfootballR/), which helps fetch player data from [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/) (among other suppliers).

Basically, we can fetch data about footballers from every team in a given league's season since its inception. So, aha, you cannot escape, Opta!

My little [{soccercolleagues} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/soccercolleagues) that [I wrote about in early 2022](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/02/04/soccercolleagues/) is built heavily (heavily!) around {worldfootballR} and has a convenience function we can use.

The niche[^footballr] primary objective of {soccercolleagues} is to let you [find pairs of football players that were colleagues at some point](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/02/04/soccercolleagues/). Like: 'which current Premier League footballer has been team mates with each of the following: Kevin Phillips, Mark Viduka, Dejan Lovren, Danny Ings and Nicky Butt?'[^boring]

Follow along. As ever, you can install the {soccercolleagues} package from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/soccercolleagues")
```

We'll also use the {tidyverse} for wrangling.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(soccercolleagues)
library(tidyverse)
```

So we can ask Transfermarkt for all the years of the English Premier League, which began in 1992:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This will take quite a long time...
epl_players <- soccercolleagues::get_players(
  seasons = 1992:2022,
  country = "England"
)
```

And now we can look for the players whose names contain the letters in 'nativity':

```{r eval=FALSE}
epl_players |>
  distinct(player_name) |>
  mutate(
    player_name = str_remove_all(tolower(player_name), " "),
    n_count = str_count(player_name, "n"),
    a_count = str_count(player_name, "a"),
    t_count = str_count(player_name, "t"),
    i_count = str_count(player_name, "i"),
    v_count = str_count(player_name, "v"),
    y_count = str_count(player_name, "y")
  ) |>
  filter(
    n_count >= 1 &
      a_count >= 1 &
      t_count >= 2 &
      i_count >= 2 &
      v_count >= 1 &
      y_count >= 1
  )
## # A tibble: 1 × 7
##   player_name    n_count a_count t_count i_count v_count y_count
##   <chr>            <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>   <int>
## 1 stiliyanpetrov       1       1       2       2       1       1
```

Oof... they were right. He is the only one.

Wow, this humble pie is so delicious, thank you so much Opta for unintentionally spoonfeeding it to me.

To be clear: Opta's data analysts have a good track record, as far as I know. But I've got my eye on you! You'll slip up one day!

...But wait. Opta were misnaming Stan as 'Stylian Petrov' [in tweets as late as 2012](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/169439820584714240?s=20). Get rekt! You missed the extra 'i' you need in 'nativity', fools! Put respect on Stiliyan's name!

'Result'.[^score]

[^sponsor]: This post is not guerilla marketing for Opta. It would be _extremely_ guerilla if they wanted to advertise on _this_ blog.
[^footballr]: There is definitely a burgeoning crossover of football stats and R users, see [Ryo](https://ryo-n7.github.io/), [Ben](https://torvaney.github.io/) and [Tony](https://tonyelhabr.rbind.io/), for example.
[^boring]: Hint: it's a very 'boring' footballer, lol.
[^score]: By which I mean I lost 1-0.
