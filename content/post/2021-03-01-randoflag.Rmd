# tl;dr
 
I wrote [a teeny-weeny R Shiny app](https://github.com/matt-dray/randoflag) to serve me a flag challenge whenever I open a new browser tab.

# A vexatious request

I thought it would be fun to set my browser tabs to open with [thiscatdoesnotexist.com](https://www.thiscatdoesnotexist.com/), which serves a random ersatz 'cat' as hallucinated by [StyleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958).[^humon] It's kind of terrifying and time for a change.

We probably accumulate hours of time looking at fresh browser tabs, so why not exploit that for fun and learning? I wanted something visual, quick and low stakes, so... world flags?

My needs were simple: show a mystery flag; reveal who it belongs to; refresh.[^spork] So I built a little [{shiny}](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app, it in [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/randoflag) and [served it](https://www.mattdray.shinyapps.io/randoflag/).

On the front-end you're presented one of [over 250 (!) emoji flags](https://emojiflags.com/)[^emoji] at random. There's a button to reveal the country it represents and another button to refresh the page via [{shinyjs}](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/). The back-end just samples a flag from the [{emo}](https://github.com/hadley/emo) package and waits for you to hit refresh. The [{bslib}](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/) package made it easy to generate a theme that keeps focus on the flag.

I've only tested it on Firefox, Chrome and Safari on iOS 14.

# Hoisting the app

The app is currently [hosted online via shinyapps.io](https://www.mattdray.shinyapps.io/randoflag/) and I've embedded it below. It's highly likely I'll take it down at some point.

Regardless, you can install and run the app from your R session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
shiny::runGitHub("randoflag", "matt-dray", "main")
```

You'll need {shiny}, {bslib} and {shinyjs} installed from CRAN and you can get {emo} using `remotes::install_github("hadley/emo")`.

# Half-mastery

Beware: some emoji flags are shared by more than one geographic entity...

[^humon]: Yeah, but [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com) is even creepier.
[^spork]: See [Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/worldflags?sc=flags) if you want an actual quiz.
[^emoji]: Why _emoji_ flags? I don't have to store hundreds of flags as images in the app's files and {emo} exists to make things very easy. Also I want to practice for when [Emojli](https://emoj.li/) inevitably returns.
