# Workshops

I went to [an accessibility workshop at the recent Sprint 18 conference](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/05/12/accessibility-workshop-at-sprint18/).

I've since been to a more in-depth workshop with [Government Digital Service]().

I learnt about two web-based services that can assess the accessibility of a given webpage: [Tenon](https://tenon.io/) and [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/).

What better way to investigate them than to test them on myself?

# The services

Both services require you to paste the URL into a text box.
