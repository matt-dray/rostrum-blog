# Accessibility workshops

I wrote about [an accessibility workshop at the recent Sprint 18 conference](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/05/12/accessibility-workshop-at-sprint18/).

I've since been to a more in-depth workshop with [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/) and learnt a bit more about some web-based services that can assess the [accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) of a given web page.

[Tenon](https://tenon.io/) and [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) were mentioned specifically and you can find more in [the list of web accessibility evaluation tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

What better way to investigate one of these services that to test it on myself? I'm going to assess the accessibility of my post about accessibility. So meta.

## Tenon example

[The results page for Tenon](https://tenon.io/testNow.php?url=https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/05/12/accessibility-workshop-at-sprint18/)

Tenon tests for compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). It reports back on errors and warnings and assigns an order of priority for fixing the problems.

![Results of Tenon’s tests](/post/2018-07-12-how-accessible-is-my-post-about-accessibility_files/tenon-issues.png)

An example of an error is that one of my images was missing alt-text. Tenon reported:

* the line of HTML code causing the error
* the priority for fixing the issue
* the line location in the HTML code
* the specific WCAG 2.0 guideline that was breached
* a description of *why* this is a problem
* a link to a recommended fix for the problem

![Example of an error, where it is and a recommended fix](/post/2018-07-12-how-accessible-is-my-post-about-accessibility_files/tenon-error.png)

That's pretty helpful. 

Tenon also generates a CSV report that details each failure. [I've hosted my report in a GitHub Gist](https://www.gist.github.com).

# Result

Not too bad.

The default settings for my Hugo theme was accountable for at least one issue: the Hugo logo image is missing alt-text, so it can't be described by a screen reader.

I also have issues where I actually have alt-text in place. These were identified by tenon as being too long. I tried to be as descriptive as possible, but it's probably a bit tedious to listen to. For example, I used these 24 words for one image:

>Thumbnail views of example posters including designing for users on the autistic spectrum, for users of screen readers and for users with low vision

That's verbose. I could do this in half the number of words:

>Posters by the Home Office showing the dos and don'ts of accessibility

Tenon also highlighted the use of *implicit headings* in my post. This was becuase I had whole single lines tagged as `\<strong>` (meaning **bold text**) to signify an audience question. It would be preferable for all section titles to use the header tags (first-level header is `\<h1>`, second-level is `\<h2>`, etc), since these a recognised specifically by screen readers.

# Behaviour change

I will:

* keep my alternative text short but descriptive
* use explicit headers using the HTML header tags (`\<h1>`, etc)
* investigate default settings for accessibility before using them

The obvious next step is to assess the accessibility of my post that assesses the accessibility of my post about accessibility.

But I'll leave that to you.
