# tl;dr

I made Wot3LdnEmojis: a London-only clone of [What3Emojis](https://what3emojis.com/) using London-related emojis and very little R code.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(sf)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
library(leaflet)
set.seed(9002488)

nuts_path <- 
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinjc/UK-GeoJSON/master/json/eurostat/ew/nuts1.json"

ldn_sf <- st_read(nuts_path, quiet = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(NUTS112NM == "London")

grid_sf <- ldn_sf %>% 
  st_make_grid(cellsize = 0.01, square = FALSE, flat_topped = TRUE) %>% 
  st_intersection(ldn_sf)

ldn_emo <- c(
  "💂", "🚇", "🏰", "👸", "🎡", "🐋", "🐦", 
  "🏙️", "🥒", "🏟️", "🐉", "🎭", "🔔", "🌳"
)

ldn_emo_combo <- expand.grid(
  emo_a = ldn_emo, emo_b = ldn_emo, emo_c = ldn_emo
) %>% 
  sample_n(length(grid_sf)) %>%
  transmute(emo_triplet = paste(emo_a, emo_b, emo_c))

grid_sf_emo <- grid_sf %>% 
  st_sf(ldn_emo_combo) %>%
  rename(., geometry = .)

leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Voyager", group = "Light") %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.DarkMatter", group = "Dark") %>%
  addPolygons(
    data = grid_sf_emo, group = "Grid", 
    color = "grey", weight = 1, opacity = 0.5,
    fill = TRUE, fillOpacity = 0,
    label = paste(grid_sf_emo$emo_triplet),
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      direction = "top", style = list("font-size" = "35px")
    ),
    highlightOptions = highlightOptions(color = "blue", weight = 3,)
  ) %>% 
  addLayersControl(
    baseGroups = c("Light", "Dark"),
    overlayGroups = "Grid",
    position = "topright",
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  )
```

Hover over a grid cell to get the emoji-triplet reference. Zoom and pan, change to dark mode, toggle the grid.

By now you've heard about various 'alternative' location systems that split the world into a grid and assign each with a value that's more human-interpretable than latitude and longitude. For example, [Google Plus Codes](https://maps.google.com/pluscodes/) and [What3Words](https://what3words.com/about).

The latter has been in the news a lot.[^w3w] In the meantime, their product has spawned a raft of spoofs, like the NSFW [Four Kings Map](https://www.fourkingmaps.co.uk/), [What3Emojis](https://what3emojis.com/) and [What2Numbers](https://www.what2numbers.org/), lol.[^w2n]

I like What3Emojis because it's tongue-in-cheek[^w3e], yes, but they also understand the 21st Century mantra that:

>No system is perfect, except for emoji.

The What3Emojis code is [openly available](https://github.com/BadIdeaFactory/what3emojis), but of course I wondered how easy it would be to make something like this in R. 

I've limited it to London because us Londoners aren't aware of anything outside of the M25. Read on for the how-to of this obnoxiously-named, cockney-baiting Wot3LdnEmojis system.

# Adam 'n' Eve it

First we need to attach [the {sf} package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for geospatial operations; [{leaflet}](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for interactive mapping; and [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for data wrangling. We'll also set a seed here for reproducible results.[^seed]

```{r, library-seed, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
set.seed(9002488)
```

We can grab the official Greater London boundary from a GeoJSON of geographic units in the UK[^nuts], which is served by the [Open Geography Portal from the Office for National Statistics](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/).

Or we would, if the site wasn't down when I went to run this. Instead, we can use the handy JSONs hosted by [Martin Chorley on GitHub](https://github.com/martinjc/UK-GeoJSON/). Hero.

```{r fetch-geojson}
nuts_path <- paste0(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinjc/UK-GeoJSON/",
  "master/json/eurostat/ew/nuts1.json"
)

ldn_sf <- st_read(nuts_path, quiet = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(NUTS112NM == "London")

ldn_sf
````

So, it's an sf-class object that behaves like a dataframe, but has some extra geospatial information stored in it.

We've got the boundary, how do we do a grid?

What3Emojis say they used 'gazillions of 4m×4m triangles' in their grid, but I don't have the computing power for that and I can't count that high. 

Instead, I bring you low-fidelity, massive hexagons. But hexagons are the patron shape of R users, so I think that's okay.

{sf} has `st_make_grid()` makes gridding easy. We can pass arguments for size and shape, then `st_intersection()` limits the grid to the area inside the London boundary only.

```{r}
grid_sf <- ldn_sf %>% 
  st_make_grid(cellsize = 0.01, square = FALSE, flat_topped = TRUE) %>% 
  st_intersection(ldn_sf)

length(grid_sf)
```

I've checked the length of the object so we know how many grid cells we need to label uniquely. The fewest number of emoji we'll need is therefore 14, since 14^3 is 2744.

Of course, I have chosen emojis that at least vaguely represent London. Below I've added [names](https://unpkg.com/emojilib@3.0.4/dist/emoji-en-US.json) and commented with my interpretation. Let me know if you have better ideas.

```{r emoji-wrangling}
ldn_emo <- c(
  metro           = "🚇",  # the tube
  guard           = "💂",  # Queen's Guard
  queen           = "👸",  # HMQE2
  castle          = "🏰",  # Tower of London
  ferris_wheel    = "🎡",  # London Eye
  bell            = "🔔",  # Big Ben (not a clock!)
  whale           = "🐋",  # Natural History Museum
  cityscape       = "🏙️",  # Canary Wharf
  cucumber        = "🥒",  # The Gherkin
  performing_arts = "🎭",  # Theatre District
  stadium         = "🏟️",  # Wembley Stadium
  dragon          = "🐉",  # City of London emblem
  bird            = "🐦",  # pigeon
  deciduous_tree  = "🌳"   # London plane tree
)
```

Depending on your operating system, there's a chance you might note be able to see some of these emoji. Oh no! Ah well.

You may also have noticed that it's utterly ridiculous to use London-related emojis to label locations in London. 'Where are you?' 'London Eye, London Eye, London Eye'. 'You're at the London Eye?' 'No.' Oh no! Ah well.

Anyway, we can get all three-way combinations of these with `expand.grid()`, then shuffle them randomly.

```{r}
ldn_emo_combo <- expand.grid(
  emo_a = ldn_emo, emo_b = ldn_emo, emo_c = ldn_emo
) %>% 
  sample_n(length(grid_sf)) %>%
  transmute(emo_triplet = paste(emo_a, emo_b, emo_c))

ldn_emo_combo$emo_triplet[1:3]
```

Then it's a case of adding the emoji information into the `grid_sf` object, which can be done via `st_df()`.

```{r add-triplets-sf}
grid_sf_emo <- grid_sf %>% 
  st_sf(ldn_emo_combo) %>%
  rename(., geometry = .)

head(grid_sf_emo)
```

You can see the triplets have been added as an extra column so there's one triplet per grid cell.

Time to create the interactive map with {leaflet}, which is built up in layers. 

I've added a light and a dark underlying map that you can toggle between[^dark] I've also made the hexagons transparent with thin borders to it's easier to see the map, but you can toggle the grid on and off to help pinpoint a location.

```{r, leaflet-map, eval=FALSE}
leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Voyager", group = "Light") %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.DarkMatter", group = "Dark") %>%
  addPolygons(
    data = grid_sf_emo, group = "Grid", 
    color = "grey", weight = 1, opacity = 0.5,
    fill = TRUE, fillOpacity = 0,
    label = paste(grid_sf_emo$emo_triplet),
    labelOptions = labelOptions(
      direction = "top", style = list("font-size" = "35px")
    ),
    highlightOptions = highlightOptions(color = "blue", weight = 3,)
  ) %>% 
  addLayersControl(
    baseGroups = c("Light", "Dark"),
    overlayGroups = "Grid",
    position = "topright",
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)
  )
```

I found:

* Buckingham Palace at 🔔🐦🥒 (Big Ben, pigeon, gherkin)
* Leicester Square at 🌳🌳🏙️ (plane tree, plane tree, Canary Wharf)
* The Shard at 🐦🐋💂 (pigeon, whale, guard)
* Wimbledon at 💂🌳🏟 (guard, plane tree, Wembley)
* The Millennium Dome at 👸🚇🐉 (Queen, tube, dragon)

Literally minutes of fun. Of course, you shouldn't use this map for anything whatsoever, possibly not even for your own amusement. I, on the other hand, can do whatever I like.

[^w3w]: This post is not about that company or its practices. See instead, for example, the excellent YouTube videos by [Andrew Steele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqK0ciE0rto) and [Mia Mulder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PPRh9ZunmI), or [Terence Eden's blog post](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/03/why-bother-with-what-three-words/). Even [the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56901363) covered it.
[^w2n]: I was genuinely tricked by this website's joke, fair play.
[^w3e]: This blog is obviously a fan of emojis, see [the one about creating SVG versions of the original emoji set](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/07/31/og-emoji-svg/) or [the one about a package for generating 'emojiscapes'](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/06/26/emojiscape/).
[^seed]: The seed value has a meaning related to London; guess what it is.
[^nuts]: The file contains [NUTS level 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature_of_Territorial_Units_for_Statistics), which is a European standard for administrative geographies. Now the UK has left the EU, it has technically switched to something called 'International Territorial Units' (ITU), which I think are the same boundaries as NUTS for the time being.
[^dark]: Darkmode required to prevent damage to poor Millennial eyes when doomscrolling at 0300.
