# tl;dr

I made [the tiny R package {cran}](https://github.com/matt-dray/cran) to convert volumes to an antiquated [measurement of fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cran_(unit)). Why? To test out [the {units} package](https://r-quantities.github.io/units/) and to resolve a joke about [the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).

# {units}

The {units} package by Edzer Pebesma, Thomas Mailund and James Hiebert ([site](https://r-quantities.github.io/units/),
[source](https://github.com/r-quantities/units/), [R
Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2016/RJ-2016-061/index.html)) helps you set and create units, convert between them and raise an error where that isn't possible.

I've used the package to solve a trivial unit conversion question and to create my own units. This post shows how.

## A _12_ gallon hat?

Here's a really simple example of the {units} package in action.

A colleague bought a 1 gallon water bottle, only to realise later that it was US gallons rather than UK gallons (_viva litres!_). What's the relationship between the two gallon units?

First install and attach the {units} package, which is available on CRAN. It will print the location where the units dataset is stored. These units are derived from the comprehensive [UNIDATA udunits database](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/), which has all the relevant [SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) and some that are a little more... nonstandard.

```{r message = TRUE}
# install.packages("units")  # install if you haven't already
library(units)
```

I'll also load a few other packages for the purposes of this post.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)
```

You can inspect the `valid_units()` dataframe to find out what units you can work with. Here's five random units from the dataframe:

```{r}
valid_udunits() %>% 
  filter(symbol != "" & name_singular != "") %>% 
  sample_n(5) %>% 
  select(symbol, name_singular, definition)
```

We can filter the `name_singular` column to find the available gallon units.

```{r}
dplyr::filter(
  valid_udunits(),
  str_detect(name_singular, "gallon")
) %>% 
  select(name_singular)
```

We're interested in `UK_liquid_gallon` and `US_liquid_gallon`, but wow, there's two more, including a 'dry' one. 

We can supply a unit to a value with `as_units()`, so we can create 1 UK gallon with the following:

```{r}
uk_gal <- as_units(1, "UK_liquid_gallon")
```

That gives us an object with class `units` and the print method adds the unit in square brackets:

```{r}
class(uk_gal)

uk_gal
```

We can also do maths with these objects:

```{r}
uk_gal + uk_gal
```

And to convert it, we can take set the units of our `unit`-class object and specify a different unit. The units need to be compatible though, so you can't convert a gallon to a parsec, for example.

```{r}
# Using purrr::safely() to capture the error
safe_set_units <- safely(set_units)
safe_set_units(uk_gal, "parsec")$error
```

This prevents you from combining non-compatible units, which is a real danger if your data is stored as bare numeric values with no unit information.

And now we'll set the new units for the gallon-to-gallon conversion.

```{r}
us_gal <- set_units(uk_gal, "US_liquid_gallon")
us_gal
```

So a UK liquid gallon is about 20% larger than a US one. But I thought everything was meant to be larger in the US!

# Herring aid

Who doesn't like getting lost in the Wikipedia rabbithole? I came upon [the page for 'cran'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cran_(unit)) and found it amusing that [the Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) (CRAN) package database had a rival. 

What's a cran, then? Well, an antiquated legal unit for measuring the volume of landed, uncleaned herring in the North Sea fishing industry. Also used as the name for [a basket that could carry that volume](http://wovencommunities.org/collection/the-quarter-cran-a-little-bit-of-history/).[^basket]

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2020-09-12-units-of-uncleaned-herring_files/cran.png" alt="Clip of 1820 report showing a cran as equalling 34 wine gallons." width="100%"/>
<p class="caption">[Second Report of the Commissioners Appointed by His Majesty to Consider the Subject of Weights and Measures, 1820](https://www.sizes.com/library/British_law/Second_Report_1820.pdf)</p>
</div>

It sounds like [the initial 18th-century measurement was volumetric and inexact](https://www.sizes.com/units/cran.htm), equalling something like 1200 fish. Later this was made official in terms of 'wine gallons', with Wikipedia pegging it to 170.5 litres in more modern units.

Naturally, I checked `valid_udunits()` and cran isn't in there. So obviously I needed to make it.

You can basically do this in three steps with {units}: define a new unit based on known units; create a unit object; convert it to the newly-defined unit.

So, you can 'install' a new unit with reference to another unit by multiplying or offsetting by some constant. In our case, our new unit is equal to 170.5 litres.

```{r}
install_conversion_constant("cran", "L", 170.5)
```

Now we can work with the cran unit. Let's first create a `unit`-class object to convert. For example, we can confirm that 170.5 litres is equal to one cran.

```{r}
one_litre <- as_units(170.5, "L")
one_litre
```

We can supply this to the `set_units()` function and specify we want it converted to cran.

```{r}
set_units(one_litre, "cran")
```

## {cran}

So I created a package called {cran} that contains this conversion. You can install it from GitHub using the {remotes} package. Except, you know, _don't_, because you have no need for it unless you're an 18th century fisherman.

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/cran")
```

And then when you load the package it asks if you want to create the cran unit. Answering 'yes' results in the cran unit being available in your session.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(cran)
```
```
## Create the 'cran' unit of measurement for this session? yes/no: yes
## You're ready to measure uncleaned herring.
```

Now you can use cran for setting and converting units. So we can revisit our check that 170.5 litres equals 1 cran:

```{r}
cran::cran_convert(170.5, "L")
```

...And that's it, basically. You can remove and reinstall the unit at any point with `cran_remove()` and `cran_install()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
cran::cran_remove()
```
```
## Remove the 'cran' unit of measurement for this session? yes/no: yes
## You're done measuring uncleaned herring.
```
