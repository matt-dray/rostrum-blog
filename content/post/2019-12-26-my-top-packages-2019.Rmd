# Thank you package-makers

I've used a lot of packages in 2019 and many have brought great joy to my R experience. Thank you to everyone who has created, maintained or contributed to a package this year.

Some particular packages of note for me have been:

* `r emo::ji("robot")` [{usethis}](#usethis) by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan
* `r emo::ji("duck")` [{drake}](#drake) by Will Landau
* `r emo::ji("cat2")` [{purrr}](#purrr) by Lionel Henry and Hadley Wickham

And some honourable mentions are:

* `r emo::ji("memo")` [{blogdown}](#blogdown) by Yihui Xie
* `r emo::ji("crossed_swords")` [{xaringan}](#xaringan) by Yihui Xie
* `r emo::ji("bow")` [{polite}](#polite) by Dmytro Perepolkin
* `r emo::ji("left_right_arrow")` [{arsenal}](#arsenal) by Ethan Heinzen, Jason Sinnwell, Elizabeth Atkinson, Tina Gunderson and Gregory Dougherty

# Packages of note

## {usethis}{#usethis}

The format and content of R packages is objectively odd. What files are necessary? What structure should it have? [The {usethis} package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/){target="_blank"} from [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/){target="_blank"}'s [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/){target="_blank"} and [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/){target="_blank"} makes it far easier for newcomers and experienced useRs alike.

In fact, you can make a minimal package in two lines:

1. `create_package()` to create the necessary package structure
1. `use_r()` to create in the right place an R script for your functions

But there's way more functions to help you set up your package. To name a few more that I use regularly:

* `use_vignette()` and `use_readme_md()` for more documentation
* `use_testthat()` and `use_test()` for setting up tests
* `use_package()` to add packages to the `Imports` section of the `DESCRIPTION` file
* `use_data()` and `use_data_raw()` to add data sets to the package and the code used to create them
* `use_*_license()` to add a license

There are also other flavours of function like `git_*()` and `pr_*()` to work with version control and `proj_*()` for working with RStudio Projects.

I focused this year on making different types of package. {usethis} made it much easier to develop:

* [{altcheckr}](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/12/08/altcheckr/){target="_blank"} to read and assess [image alt text from web pages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/){target="_blank"}
* [{oystr}](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/12/23/oystr/){target="_blank"} to handle London travel-history data from an [Oyster card](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/entry.do){target="_blank"}
* [{gdstheme}](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/05/24/xaringan-template/){target="_blank"} to use a [{xaringan}](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/){target="_blank"} presentation theme and template
* [{blogsnip}](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/10/22/blogsnip/){target="_blank"} to insert blog-related code snippets via an [RStudio addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/){target="_blank"} (there's even a `use_addin()` function to create the all-important `inst/rstudio/addins.dcf` file)


For more package-development info, I recommend [Emil Hvitfeldt's {usethis} workflow](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/usethis-workflow-for-package-development/){target="_blank"}, as well as [Karl Broman's R Package Primer](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/){target="_blank"} and [Hadley Wickham's R Packages book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/){target="_blank"}. To help me remember this stuff, [I also wrote some slides about developing a package from scratch](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/11/01/usethis/){target="_blank"} with {usethis} functions.

## {drake}{#drake}

Your analysis has got 12 input data files. They pass through 15 functions There are some computationally-intensive, long-running processes. Plots and tables are produced and R Markdown files are rendered. How do you keep on top of this? Is it enough to have a set of numbered script files (`01_read.R`, etc) or a single script file that sources the rest? What if something changes? Do you have to re-run everything from scratch?

You need a workflow manager. Save yourself some hassle and use [Will Landau](https://wlandau.github.io/){target="_blank"}'s [{drake} package](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/){target="_blank"}, backed by [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/02/06/drake/){target="_blank"}'s peer review process. {drake} 'remembers' all the dependencies between files and only re-runs what needs to be re-run if any errors are found or changes are made. It also provides visualisations of your workflow and allows for high-performance computing.

In short, you:

1. Supply the steps of your analysis as functions to `drake_plan()`, which generates a data frame of commands (functions) to operate over a set of targets (objects)
1. Run `make()` on your plan to run the steps and generate the outputs
1. If required, make changes anywhere in your workflow and re-`make()` the plan -- {drake} will only re-run things that are dependent on what you changed

Below is an extreme example from a happy customer (click through to [the image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ELljfy5XsAAM8Xv?format=jpg&name=small){target="_blank"} if you can't see the embedded tweet). Each point on the graph is an object or function; black ones are out of date and will be updated when `make()` is next run.

```{r twitter, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '1205103780938833921')
```

It's hard to do {drake} justice in just a few paragraphs, but luckily it's one of the best-documented packages out there. Take a look at:

* the [{drake} rOpenSci website](https://github.com/ropensci/drake){target="_blank"}
* the [thorough user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/){target="_blank"}
* the [learndrake GitHub repo](https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake){target="_blank"}, which can be launched in the cloud
* the [drakeplanner Shiny app](https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/drakeplanner/){target="_blank"} 
* Will's [{drake} examples page](https://wlandau.github.io/drake-examples/){target="_blank"}
* this [rOpenSci community call](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-09-24/){target="_blank"}
* a [Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00550){target="_blank"}
* more things listed in [the documentation section of the user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/index.html#documentation){target="_blank"}

I [wrote about {drake} earlier in the year](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-09-24/){target="_blank"} and [made a demo](https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap){target="_blank"} and [some slides](https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/docs/drake-presentation.pdf){target="_blank"}. I think it could be useful for reproducibility of statistical publications in particular.

## {purrr}{#purrr}

You want to apply a function over the elements of some list or vector.

The `map()` family of functions from [the {purrr} package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}--by [Lionel Henry](https://twitter.com/_lionelhenry?lang=en){target="_blank"} and [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/){target="_blank"} of [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/){target="_blank"}--has a concise and consistent syntax for doing this.

You can choose what gets returned from your iterations by selecting the appropriate `map_*()` variant: `map()` for a list, `map_df()` for a data frame, `map_chr()` for a character vector and so on. Here's a trivial example that counts the number of [Street Fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior){target="_blank"} characters from selected continents. Here's a list:

```{r list}
# Create the example list
street_fighter <- list(
 china = "Chun Li", japan = c("Ryu", "E Honda"),
 usa = c("Ken", "Guile", "Balrog"), `???` = "M Bison"
)

street_fighter  # take a look at the list
```

Now to map the `length()` function to each element of the list and return a named integer vector.

```{r map-int}
library(purrr)  # load the package

# Get the length of each list element
purrr::map_int(
  street_fighter,  # list
  length           # function
)
```

But what if you want to iterate over two or more elements? You can use `map2()` or `pmap()`. And what if you want to get the side effects? `walk()` and `pwalk()`.

{purrr} is also great for working with data frames with columns that contain lists (listcols), like the `starwars` data from the {dplyr} package. Let's use the `length()` function again, but in the context of a listcol, to get the characters in the most films.

```{r listcol}
# Load packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(purrr)

# map() a listcol within a mutate() call
starwars %>% 
  mutate(films_count = map_int(films, length)) %>% 
  select(name, films, films_count) %>% 
  arrange(desc(films_count)) %>% head()
```

Why not just write a loop or use the `*apply` functions? [Jenny Bryan has a good {purrr} tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/bk01_base-functions.html){target="_blank"} that explains why you might consider either choice. Basically, do what you feel; I like the syntax consistency and the ability to predict what function I need based on its name.

Check out the excellent [{purrr} cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/purrr.pdf){target="_blank"} for some prompts and excellent visual guidance.

# Honourable mentions

## {blogdown}{#blogdown}

This blog, and I'm sure [many others](https://awesome-blogdown.com/){target="_blank"}, wouldn't exist without [{blogdown}](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/blob/master/README.md){target="_blank"} by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/){target="_blank"}. {blogdown} lets you write and render R Markdown files into blog posts via static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/){target="_blank"}. This is brilliant if you're trying to get R output into a blog post with minimal fuss. [The {blogdown} book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/){target="_blank"} by Yihui, [Amber Thomas](https://amber.rbind.io/){target="_blank"}, [Alison Presmanes Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/){target="_blank"} is particularly helpful.

## {xaringan}{#xaringan}

[{xaringan}](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1){target="_blank"} is another great package from [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/){target="_blank"} that lets you turn R Markdown into a slideshow using [remark.js](http://remarkjs.com/){target="_blank"}. It's very customisable via CSS, to the extent that I was able [to mimic the house style of my organisation](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/05/24/xaringan-template/){target="_blank"} this year. One of my favourite functions[^yolo] is `inf_mr()` (Infinite Moon Reader), which lets you [live-preview your outputs as they're written](https://yihui.org/en/2019/02/ultimate-inf-mr/){target="_blank"}.

## {polite}{#polite}

Web scraping is ethically dubious if you fail to respect the terms of the sites you're visiting. [Dmytro Perepolkin](https://www.ddrive.no/){target="_blank"} has made it easy to be a good citizen of the internet with [the {polite} package](https://dmi3kno.github.io/polite/){target="_blank"}, which has just hit version 1.0.0 and is on CRAN (congratulations!). First you introduce yourself to the site with a `bow()` and collect any information about limits and no-go pages from [the robots.txt file](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html){target="_blank"}, then you can modify search paths with a `nod()` and collect information from them with a `scrape()`. Very responsible.

## {arsenal}{#arsenal}

I've been using the handy[^arsenal] {arsenal} package to compare data frames as part of a quality assurance process. First, you supply two data frames to `comparedf()` to create a 'compare' object. Run `diffs()` on that object to create a new data frame where each row is a mismatch, given a tolerance, with columns for the location and values that are causing problems. We managed to quality assure nearly a million values with this method in next to no time. [Check out their vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arsenal/vignettes/comparedf.html){target="_blank"} on how to do this.

# Bonus!

## {govdown}

Aha, well done for reading this far. As a bonus, I'm calling out [Duncan Garmonsway](https://twitter.com/nacnudus){target="_blank"}'s [{govdown} package](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/govdown/){target="_blank"}. Duncan grappled with the complexities of things like Pandoc and Lua filters to build a package that applies the accessibility-friendly [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/){target="_blank"} to R Markdown. This means you can create things like the [the Reproducible Analaytical Pipelines (RAP) website](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/){target="_blank"} in the style of [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/){target="_blank"}. [Endorsed by Yihui Xie himself](https://twitter.com/nacnudus/status/1186600342072516608){target="_blank"}! Check out Duncan's [{tidyxl} and {unpivotr} packages for handling nightmare Excel files](https://nacnudus.github.io/spreadsheet-munging-strategies/){target="_blank"} while you're at it.
