# tl;dr

R is '[a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics](https://www.r-project.org/)'. Ahahaha, no it's not, it's a game engine. I've created [a 'splendid' list of games](https://github.com/matt-dray/awesome-r-games) you can play—written in R—to prove it. [Help expand it](https://github.com/matt-dray/splendid-r-games/issues).

# Stats only!

R is not a general, multi-purpose programming language. It was written to do statistical analysis and make charts. You are literally not allowed to do anything else with it. You should use \<LANGUAGE\> instead, which is much more suited to your specific use case. R is a joke language for nerds.

You should not read beyond this point if you think, quite rightly, that mirth and frivolity are unsuited to an R session.

# Stats only?

Unity. Unreal. GameMaker. Godot. All of these videogame engines are now obsolete. 

It is R—humble R!—that represents the future of gaming.

To prove it, I've created [a list of 'splendid R games' in a GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/awesome-r-games)[^splendid] that you are welcome to contribute to.[^fool]

Yes, R can be used for fun. Do not tell R Core.

# Wait, he's serious?

I think there's three kinds of 'platform' for games written in R:

1. For the console
2. In Shiny
3. Ported

Games played in the console are pretty straightforward and probably most common. You can run some code, or a function from a package, to launch some code in the R console that you can interact with. A simple option for this might involve use of `readline()` to receive user input, for example, like [Giora Simchoni](https://www.giorasimchoni.com/)'s excellent text-based puzzler, [Castle of R](https://github.com/gsimchoni/CastleOfR).

<div class="figure">

The user has typed option '4', which corresponds to the text 'what is R?'. The resulting text says 'welcome to the Castle of R' and explains its purpose." width="100%"/>

Shiny can give you a little more flexibility when it comes to graphics and user input, at the expense of needing to host the app and maybe some extra JavaScript skills. A great example of this is [Pedro Silva](https://www.pedrocsilva.com/)'s winning entry ([app](https://sparktuga.shinyapps.io/ShinyDecisions/), [source](https://github.com/pedrocoutinhosilva/shiny.decisions)) to [the Posit Shiny contest in 2020](https://posit.co/blog/winners-of-the-2nd-shiny-contest/).

Text at the bottom says 'swipe left or right on the card to start'." width="100%"/>

The third category is a little more boundary-pushing. Imagine if R was powerful enough to let you port existing games. Well, surprise, ya boi [Mike Cheng](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/) (aka coolbutuseless) has pushed hard on expanding the capabilities of R to run fast enough and with realtime user input,[^nara] porting the classic [_Another World_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_(video_game)) (1991) to R, which was showcased at 2022's Posit conference ([source](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/anotherworld), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPotWAJnE_s), [blog](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2022/07/29/anotherworld-game-written-playable-in-r-with-nara-and-eventloop/)).

Of course, within these 'platforms' are genres like word games, arcade games, puzzle games, etc. Will you be the first to create an MMORPG (a massively-multiplayer online R-powered game)?

# I am an indie game dev now

I've always been interested in how videogames are coded,[^yt] wishing that I could do the same myself. Of course I could simply learn 'real' programming languages. 

Except that's blasphemy. Of course I'd rather break my own mind and spirit in an attempt to make R achieve 0.1% of what might be possible in P*thon.

Case in point, I've made a few R packages containing some little toys (in order of gooddest to baddest):

* {r.oguelike} ([source](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike), [blogs](https://www.rostrum.blog/tags/r.oguelike/)) for a procedural-dungeon explorer with enemy pathfinding and inventory 
* {tamRgo} ([source](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo), [blog](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo)) for a cyber pet in your R console that persists between sessions
* {safar6} ([source](https://github.com/matt-dray/safar6), [blog](https://github.com/matt-dray/safar6)) for a text-based re-make of the Safari Zone from the first generation of Pokémon games
* {ActionSquirrel} ([source](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/10/03/squirrel/), [blog](https://github.com/matt-dray/ActionSquirrel)) for a tile-based, turn-based minigame in the R console
* {hokey} ([source](https://github.com/matt-dray/hokey), [blog](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/01/19/keypress/)) for minigames that use [direct keypress inputs with {keypress}](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/keypress)

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2023-04-02_splendid-r-games_files/kevin.png" alt="Screenshot of R running in the terminal. The get_stats and see_pet functions from the tamRgo package have been run. The first prints some output showing characteristics and status of a cyber pet. The latter prints an image of the pet to the browser. The pet is called Kevin and is 139 in age. It appears to be unalive." width="100%"/>
<p class="caption">Hint when playing {tamRgo}: do not forget about your pet for 138 days. RIP Kevin XVIII.</p>

I've got something in the pipeline that involves extremely rudimentary physics in the R console. Wow! For release in 2023 (because game launches never go wrong).

# Ready Player 2

The splendid list must be missing a bunch of games. Please leave an issue or pull request [in the splendid-r-games repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/splendid-r-games) to add more examples.

Next stop: letting people run R games in the browser without an installed copy of R. This is already possible with a service like [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), which can spin up an instance of RStudio with packages pre-installed [I did this for {r.oguelike}](https://github.com/matt-dray/play-r.oguelike)).

<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Just like [the Nokia N-Gage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Gage_(device)), amirite?</p>
</div>

But soon you might be able to [use WebR to play games in the browser](https://github.com/r-wasm/webr) without even spinning up RStudio, ooh. So look out for an R version of [itch.io](https://itch.io/) in future, lol.

[^yt]: I like YouTube devlogs by folks like [Seb Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague), [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/@ThinMatrix), [SquidGod](https://www.youtube.com/@SquidGodDev), [Jonas](https://www.youtube.com/c/jonastyroller), [TanTan](https://www.youtube.com/@Tantandev) and others. R can never achieve what they're up to, but I like listening through the logic of what they're doing.
[^splendid]: I originally labelled the GitHub repo as [an 'awesome' repo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), which I later learned has [a very specific meaning](https://github.com/matt-dray/splendid-r-games/issues/4#issuecomment-1205015274). You might have seen awesome lists before, like the [awesome-quarto repo](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto) by [Mickaël](https://github.com/mcanouil), or the new [awesome-webr list](https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-webr) by [Nan Xiao](https://nanx.me/). 'Splendid' is much more of a Bri'ish word than 'awesome', so it feels more natural anyway.
[^fool]: Note that I have carefully released this post just after April fool's day, which means I am super, super serious. As usual.
[^nara]: See the [{nara}](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/nara/index.html) and [{eventloop}](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/eventloop/index.html) packages in particular.
