<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>What if public sector data scientists simply… shared the tools they make?</p>

<h1>An axe to grind</h1>
<p>I’m speaking today at an event for UK government data scientists with the theme ‘the data science toolshed’. My plea is small: I want public sector workers to share the tools they make.</p>
<p>We should build modular things like R packages that are easy to use and develop; make them available to everyone to minimise duplication and encourage collaboration; and maximise reach by telling everyone about it. This is how we improve quality and build our community. And save money for the taxpayer.</p>
<p>Handily, this is already expressed in the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice">Technology Code of Practice</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Share, reuse and collaborate: avoid duplicating effort and unnecessary costs by collaborating across government and sharing and reusing technology, data, and services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve had a small experience with this: I made <a href="https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/">the {a11ytables} R package</a> to help producers of stats publications create best-practice, accessible spreadsheets using R. It’s now being used across the public sector and is referenced from <a href="https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/further-resources-for-releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/">the government’s best-practice guidance</a>.</p>
<p>Success? Yes. But also PANIK. I’ve left the organisation where I made it, so maintenance is trickier without GitHub admin privileges. I worry that I should have thought about this sooner, that I should fork and update it, that updating users will be hard and that links to the old package will break.</p>
<p>The earlier you consider future issues, the better.</p>

<h1>Burying the hatchet</h1>
<p>So I volunteered to run my own talk therapy, basically. Maybe someone else can learn from it.</p>
<p>The slides are live <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/government-toolshed/">on the internet</a> and embedded below, or you can view <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/government-toolshed/#/section-1">the source on GitHub</a>. Press ‘s’ to pop out the speaker notes.</p>

<p>The slides were made with <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/">Revealjs via Quarto</a>, because of course they were.</p>

<div id="clamp-down" class="section level1">
<h1>Clamp down</h1>
<p>So I vouch for sustainabilising (not a word), centralising and advertising the useful things you make. Maybe we could have a list or store of tools we’ve produced collectively? Something like <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">an ‘Awesome’ list</a> or a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/">CRAN task view</a>. Maybe that would make it easier to find and develop existing solutions instead of building from scratch all the time.</p>
<p>Build a toolshed. They will come?</p>
