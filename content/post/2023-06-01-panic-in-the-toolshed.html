<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>What if public sector data scientists simply… shared their hard work?</p>

<h1>In the toolshed</h1>
<p>I’m speaking today at a cross-government data-science event called ‘the data science toolshed’. My plea is very small. I want everyone to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sustainabilise</li>
<li>Centralise</li>
<li>Advertise</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, build modular tools like R packages that are easier to use and develop; make them available to everyone to minimise duplication and encourage collaboration; and make sure to tell everyone about it to maximise reach. This is how we improve quality and build our community. And save money for the taxpayer.</p>
<p>I’ve got some experience in this field: I made <a href="https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/">the {a11ytables} R package</a> to help producers of stats publications create best-practice, accessible spreadsheets using R. After I made it, I didn’t shut up about it, and now it’s being used across the public sector.</p>
<p>Success? Yes. But also PANIK. I’ve:</p>
<ul>
<li>left the org where I wrote the package and no longer have full admin permissions</li>
<li>not tried to transfer the repo to a more central location, like the Office for National Statistics’s <a href="https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact">best-practice-and-impact</a> GitHub org (it might add pressure on them to ensure it’s ‘good enough’ and that they can keep it up to date in my absence)</li>
<li>considered updating from {openxlsx} to {openxlsx2} under the hood, but I’m not sure if I should update {a11ytables}, or fork {a11ytables2} and go back to users all over again to tell them to upgrade?</li>
</ul>
<p>So I volunteered for my own talk therapy so I could explain my success and predicaments with the wider data science network.</p>
<p>Regardless, I vouch for sustainabilising, centralising and advertising the useful things you make. Maybe we could have a centralised list or store of tools we’ve produced collectively? Maybe that would make it easier to find and develop existing solutions instead of building from scratch all the time.</p>
<p>Build a toolshed. They will come?</p>
