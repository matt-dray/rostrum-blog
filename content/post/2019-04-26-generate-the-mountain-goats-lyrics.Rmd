[The Mountain Goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats) released [_In League with Dragons_](https://www.metacritic.com/music/in-league-with-dragons/the-mountain-goats) today, their [seventeenth studio album](http://www.mountain-goats.com/discography/).

[John Darnielle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Darnielle) has written a lot of words across the Mountain Goat's [back catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats_discography). His lyrics are poetic and descriptive, covering fictional and autobiographical themes that include substance abuse, professional wrestling and cadaver-sniffing dogs.

Can we generate new Mountain Goats lyrics given this rich text data set? This is a short post to do exactly that using the {spotifyr}, {genius} and {markovifyR} packages for R.

Hit play below while reading to generate the right mood.

# Get lyrics

[The {spotifyr} package](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/) pulls artist and album information from the music streaming service [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com), along with some interesting audio features like 'danceability' and 'acousticness'. It also fetches lyrics from [Genius](https://genius.com/) via [the {genius} package](https://github.com/josiahparry/genius)
.

First get a developer account for the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). Run `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and add your client ID and secret in the form `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=X` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=Y`. The `get_spotify_access_token()` function will add an access token to your environment, which will authenticate each API request.

```{r}
library(spotifyr)  # install.packages("spotifyr")
access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
```

The `get_discography()` function fetches a named artist's back-catalogue, including the lyrics. Beware: this may include some duplicates from different regions or because of reissues or deluxe versions.

```{r eval=FALSE}
goat_discography <- spotifyr::get_discography("the mountain goats")
```

You can run the line above, or you can just use `download.file()` to get an RDS version stored on rostrum.blog (note that this file will become out of date as the Mountain Goats release more material).

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Download the RDS file of the raw dataframe
download.file(
  "https://www.rostrum.blog/datasets/goat_discography.RDS",  # data hosted here
  "~/Documents/goat_discography.RDS"  # where to put file locally
  )

# Read the file from local source and check number of columns
library(readr)
goat_discography <- read_rds("~/Documents/goat_discography.RDS")
dim(goat_discography)
```

This is a relatively wide data frame with 41 columns of data for nearly 400 songs. Let's simplify the columns and for fun we can look at five random sings and their 'energy'.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)  # for data manipulation and %>%

goat_disco <- goat_discography %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(
    album_name, album_release_year,  # album
    track_name, track_number, duration_ms,  # track info
    key_name, mode_name, key_mode, tempo, time_signature,  # music info
    danceability, energy, loudness, mode, speechiness,  # audio features
    acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence,  # audio features
    lyrics
  )

sample_n(goat_disco, 5) %>%
  select(album_name, track_name, energy)  # a sample
```

I'll be saving this data frame for some other analysis, but for now we'll need only the lyrics. The lyrics are stored in a list-column as a separate tibble (data frame) per song.

```{r}
library(tidyr)  # for unnest()

goat_lyrics <- goat_disco %>%
  filter(lyrics != "NULL") %>%  # remove rows where lyrics weren't collected
  unnest(lyrics) %>%  # unpack the lyrics list-column
  filter(!is.na(lyric)) %>%  # remove empty lyrics
  select(-line) %>%  # unneeded column
  group_by(lyric) %>% slice(1) %>%  ungroup() %>% # remove duplicate lyrics
  pull(lyric)  # convert column to character vector

sample(goat_lyrics, 10)  # a sample
```

# Generate lyrics

We can use a Markov chain to generate new lyrics based on our data set. Basically, it will predict the next word from the current one based on the likelihood from our input data set. You can [read more about this principle elsewhere](https://hackernoon.com/from-what-is-a-markov-model-to-here-is-how-markov-models-work-1ac5f4629b71).

[The {markovifyR} package](https://github.com/abresler/markovifyR) is a wrapper for [the Python package `markovify`](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify), which 'is a simple, extensible Markov chain generator'. You can install `markovify` at the command line via R's `system()` function. {furrr} is also needed.

```{r message=FALSE}
# system("pip install markovify")
library(markovifyR)  # remotes::install_github("abresler/markovifyR")
library(furrr)  # install.packages("furrr")
```

Now we can generate the model given all the lyrics.

```{r}
markov_model <- generate_markovify_model(
    input_text = goat_lyrics,
    markov_state_size = 2L,
    max_overlap_total = 25,
    max_overlap_ratio = 0.7
  )
```

You can meddle with these controls, but I've kept to the suggested defaults for now. Note that 'overlap' relates to the likelihood of generating whole sentences that already exist. See [`markovify`](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) for more detail.

## Generate lines

Use the `markovify_text()` function with our `markov_model` object to generate single lines.

Fans of the Mountain Goats will no doubt recognise some of the phrases from existing songs.

```{r}
goat_speak <- markovify_text(
  markov_model = markov_model,
  maximum_sentence_length = NULL,
  output_column_name = 'goat_speak',
  count = 50,
  tries = 100,
  only_distinct = TRUE,
  return_message = TRUE
)
```

I ran this function a few times and here a few outputs that made me laugh (or think):

* But I felt all the Portuguese water dogs?
* I write reminders on my kimono that I could not remember
* Leann Rimes on the ocean
* Sunset spilling through your megaphone
* It's the most gorgeous cow I'd ever wanted
* I hope I never liked Morrissey
* Went and got the case of vodka from a disco in old east Berlin
* Fresh coffee at sunrise, warm my lips like a dying man
* But my love is like a tattoo into my ear
* And you brought me a bowl of cooked wild grasses
* We had hot caramel sticking to her skin
* And then the special chicken
* And a bird we would have liked brought the Norman invasion
* How come there's peacocks in the face of the rainbow

## Generate a verse 

You can also choose to seed the first word in the sentence. You can do this in such a way that you can create a sort-of possible-sounding stanza.

```{r}
goat_speak <- markovify_text(
  markov_model = markov_model,
  maximum_sentence_length = NULL,
  output_column_name = 'goat_lyric',
  start_words = c("I", "And", "But", "So"),
  count = 1,
  tries = 100,
  only_distinct = TRUE,
  return_message = TRUE
)
```

...or not.

I think John Darnielle probably remains the best generator of Mountain Goats lyrics for now.
