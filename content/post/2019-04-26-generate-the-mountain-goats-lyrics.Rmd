[The Mountain Goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats) released [_In League with Dragons_](https://www.metacritic.com/music/in-league-with-dragons/the-mountain-goats) today, their [seventeenth studio album](http://www.mountain-goats.com/discography/).

[John Darnielle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Darnielle) has written a lot of words across the Mountain Goat's [back catalogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats_discography). His lyrics are poetic and descriptive, covering fictional and autobiographical themes that include susbtance abuse, professional wrestling and cadaver-sniffing dogs.

Can we generate new Mountain Goats lyrics given this rich text dataset? This is a short post to do exactly that using the {spotifyr}, {genius} and {markovifyR} packages for R.

Hit play below while reading to generate the right mood.

# Get lyrics

[The {spotifyr} package](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/)[^spotifyr] pulls artist and album information from the music streaming service [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com), along with some interesting audio features like 'danceability' and 'acousticness'. It also fetches lyrics from [Genius](https://genius.com/) via [the {genius} package](https://github.com/josiahparry/genius)[^genius].

First get a developer account for the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). Run `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and add your client ID and secret in the form `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=X` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=Y`. The `get_spotify_access_token()` function will add an access token to your environment, which will authenticate each API request.

```{r}
library(spotifyr)  # install.packages("spotifyr")
access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
```

The `get_discography()` function fetches a named artist's back-catalogue, including the lyrics. Beware: this may include some duplicates from different regions or because of reissues or deluxe versions.

```{r eval=FALSE}
goat_discography <- spotifyr::get_discography("the mountain goats")
dim(goat_discography)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
# An RDS of the raw dataframe was saved to desktop and called into this post.
# This means I don't have to run get_discography() multiple times.
goat_discography <- readRDS("~/Desktop/goat_discography.RDS")
dim(goat_discography)
```

This is a hefty dataframe with 41 columns of data for nearly 400 songs. Let's simplify the columns and for fun we can look at five random sings and their 'energy'.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)  # for data manipulation and %>%

goat_disco <- goat_discography %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(
    album_name, album_release_year,  # album
    track_name, track_number, duration_ms,  # track info
    key_name, mode_name, key_mode, tempo, time_signature,  # music info
    danceability, energy, loudness, mode, speechiness,  # audio features
    acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence,  # audio features
    lyrics
  )

sample_n(goat_disco, 5) %>%
  select(album_name, track_name, energy)  # a sample
```

I'll be saving this dataframe for some other analysis, but for now we'll need only the lyrics. The lyrics are stored in a list-column as a separate tibble (data frame) per song.

```{r}
library(tidyr)  # for unnest()

goat_lyrics <- goat_disco %>%
  filter(lyrics != "NULL") %>%  # remove rows where lyrics weren't collected
  unnest(lyrics) %>%  # unpack the lyrics list-column
  filter(!is.na(lyric)) %>%  # remove empty lyrics
  select(-line) %>%  # unneeded column
  group_by(lyric) %>% slice(1) %>%  ungroup() %>% # remove duplicate lyrics
  pull(lyric)  # convert column to character vector

sample(goat_lyrics, 10)  # a sample
```

# Generate lyrics

We can use a Markov chain to generate new lyrics based on our dataset. Basically, it will predict the next word from the current one based on the likelihood from our input dataset. You can [read more about this principle elsewhere](https://hackernoon.com/from-what-is-a-markov-model-to-here-is-how-markov-models-work-1ac5f4629b71).

[The {markovifyR} package](https://github.com/abresler/markovifyR)[^markovifyr] is a wrapper for [the Python package `markovify`](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify), which 'is a simple, extensible Markov chain generator'. You can install `markovify` at the command line via R's `system()` function. {furrr} is also needed.

```{r message=FALSE}
# system("pip install markovify")
library(markovifyR)  # remotes::install_github("abresler/markovifyR")
library(furrr)  # install.packages("furrr")
```

Now we can generate the model given all the lyrics.

```{r}
markov_model <- generate_markovify_model(
    input_text = goat_lyrics,
    markov_state_size = 2L,
    max_overlap_total = 25,
    max_overlap_ratio = 0.7
  )
```

You can meddle with these controls, but I've kept to the suggested defaults for now. Note that 'overlap' relates to the likelihood of generating whole sentences that already exist. See [`markovify`](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) for more detail.

Now to generate a bunch of lines.

```{r}
goat_speak <- markovify_text(
  markov_model = markov_model,
  maximum_sentence_length = NULL,
  output_column_name = 'goat_speak',
  count = 50,
  tries = 100,
  only_distinct = TRUE,
  return_message = TRUE
)
```

Mountain Goats fans will probably recognise a few familiar patterns in the text that emerges.

I ran this function a few times and here a few outputs that made me laugh (or think):

* And a bird we would have liked brought the Norman invasion
* I hope I never liked Morrissey
* Went and got the case of vodka from a disco in old east Berlin
* Fresh coffee at sunrise, warm my lips like a dying man
* But I felt all the Portuguese water dogs?
* But my love is like a tattoo into my ear
* I write reminders on my kimono that I could not remember
* And you brought me a bowl of cooked wild grasses
* We had hot caramel sticking to her skin
* And then the special chicken
* Leann Rimes on the ocean
* Sunset spilling through your megaphone
* It's the most gorgeous cow I'd ever wanted
* How come there's peacocks in the face of the rainbow

You can also choose to seed the first word in the sentence. You can do this in such a way that you can create a sort-of possible-sounding stanza.

```{r}
goat_speak <- markovify_text(
  markov_model = markov_model,
  maximum_sentence_length = NULL,
  output_column_name = 'goat_lyric',
  start_words = c("I", "And", "But", "So"),
  count = 1,
  tries = 100,
  only_distinct = TRUE,
  return_message = TRUE
)
```

...or not.

I think John Darnielle probably remains the best generator of Mountain Goats lyrics for now.
