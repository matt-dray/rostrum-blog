<li><a href="https://swirlstats.com/">{swirl}</a> lets people learn R from within R.</li>
<li><a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/">{swirlify}</a> is a package to help write Swirl courses</li>

<h1>Swirl</h1>
<p>The {swirl} package lets you learn R interactively from within R itself.</p>
<p>Swirl prints questions in the console and users have to answer correctly before they can move on.</p>
<p>To begin, install and load the package then follow the instructions that Swirl gives you.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;swirl&quot;)
library(swirl)
swirl()</code></pre>
<p>Full instructions are on Swirl’s <a href="">website</a>.</p>
<p>New courses can be downloaded from the <a href="">Swirl Course Network</a>, but can also be sourced from GitHub or a zip file, for example.</p>
<p>I like Swirl. It’s active, self-paced and extensible. But this post isn’t about using Swirl, it’s about creating new Swirl courses.</p>

<h1>Teach others to teach</h1>
<p>Swirl is a fish. Teaching people to fish is Swirlify. Teaching people to teach people to fish is this post.</p>
<p>Swirl suffers because its library of courses is relatively small. More people need to make materials and share them. This shouldn’t be a problem for the thriving R community.</p>
<div id="swirlify" class="section level2">
<h2>Swirlify</h2>
<p>Sean Kross and Nick Carchedi have created <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=swirlify">the {swirlify} package</a> to make course creation easy.</p>
<p><a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/">Full Swirlify guidance</a> is available. This post covers the basics to get you started.</p>

<h2>Simple workflow</h2>
<p>Let’s create a new course about insects where each lesson is about a different order. To start:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new_lesson(course_name = &quot;Course&quot;, lesson_name = &quot;Lesson 1&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>These folders and template files get created:</p>
<pre><code>Home
└── Course
    └── Lesson_1
        ├── customTests.R
        ├── dependson.txt
        ├── initLesson.R
        └── lesson.yaml</code></pre>
<p>Lesson content goes in <code>lesson.yaml</code>. This is the only file we care about right now. But we don’t have to touch it. Begin content creation with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>swirlify()</code></pre>
<p>The Shiny app GUI will open. On the left is where you create new questions. On the right you can see the lesson file itself.</p>
<p>To build a question:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose a question type from the dropdown menu</li>
<li>Fill in the text boxes (‘Make Answer Test from Correct Answer’ will help you by autofilling ‘Answer Tests’ from ‘Correct Answer’)</li>
<li>Click ‘Add Question’</li>
<li>Click ‘Save Lesson’</li>
<li>optional: click ‘Demo Lesson’ to try it out</li>
</ol>
<p>Rinse and repeat until you’ve finished the lesson.</p>
<p>To create the next lesson, use the code above, but change the <code>lesson_name</code> argument to the name of the new lesson.</p>
</div>
<div id="share-it" class="section level2">
<h2>Share it</h2>
<p>There are several ways to share it.</p>
</div>
<div id="minimal-extra-info" class="section level2">
<h2>Minimal extra info</h2>
<ul>
<li>Different question types</li>
<li>‘Message’ questions should be used to provide information – they’re statements rather than questions</li>
<li>Answer tests</li>
<li>YAML</li>
<li>Auto-test your course</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="tidyswirl" class="section level1">
<h1>Tidyswirl</h1>
<p>I’ve started a Swirl course that might be useful. It’s called Tidyswirl and the goal is to have a lesson that introduces each core package of <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">the tidyverse</a>.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contribute new courses or raise issues.</p>
<p>To install the course so you can use it in Swirl:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install_course_github(&quot;matt-dray&quot;, &quot;tidyswirl&quot;)</code></pre>
