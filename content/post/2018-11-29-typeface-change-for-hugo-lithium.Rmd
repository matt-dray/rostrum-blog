# Hugo themes

The [Lithium theme for Hugo] was built originally by [Jonathan Rutheiser](https://github.com/jrutheiser). [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/about/) then [tweaked it] for use with [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I'll be focusing on this theme because it's the one used for this site. This theme may differ from your theme in the way it is constructed, so not everything below will be relevant to you.

Sections [2.5.1](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html#how-to) and [2.7](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/static-files.html) of the Blogdown book refer to the ability to change fonts for your site.

The defaulttypefaces for the Hugo Lithium theme are [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) (serif) and [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) (sans-serif).

# Get typefaces

For this demo, I'm using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Once you're on the specimen page for a given font -- [like this one for Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) -- you can click 'SELECT THIS FONT' to add it to a list for later viewing. You can access this list at the bottom right of the page in a drawer that says 'X Families Selected'.

There's some useful information in this drawer. For Fira Sans it has two chunks of CSS under 'EMBED': one to help embed the font and one to specify in CSS. You'll need this information later.

To download the typeface, you can click 'CUSTOMIZE' in the tray to select which elements of the font family you want (light, medium, semi-bold, etc) and then click the download button (downward pointing arrow) in the upper right of the tray. This will download a .zip file containing your typefaces in many file formats.

For the Hugo Lithium theme site, fonts live at the path [`/themes/hugo-lithium-theme/static/fonts/`](https://github.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/tree/master/themes/hugo-lithium-theme/static/fonts). There you'll find the files for our two default fonts, Merriweather and Lato. There are two filetypes for each font: `.woff` and `.woff2`. . WOFF stands for [Web Open Font Format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/WOFF).

# Activate fonts

Having downloaded the fonts, you'll need to change two CSS files:

* [fonts.css](https://github.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/blob/master/themes/hugo-lithium-theme/static/css/fonts.css)
* [main.css](https://github.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/blob/master/themes/hugo-lithium-theme/static/css/main.css)
