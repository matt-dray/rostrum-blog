# {blogdown} and Hugo themes

You can change the default font face for your [Blogdown blog](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by downloading new ones from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (or [Google Web Fonts Helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts){target="_blank"}) and adjusting some CSS.

The advice in this blog is intended for users of the the [Lithium theme for Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-lithium-theme/), built originally by [Jonathan Rutheiser](https://github.com/jrutheiser) and edited for use with [{blogdown}](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium) . The advice below may still be relevant for other themes.

See Sections [2.5.1](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html#how-to) and [2.7](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/static-files.html) of [the Blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for more information.

# The default CSS

Below is the default `fonts.css` file for the Hugo Lithium theme, which sits at the file path `themes/hugo-lithium-theme/static/css/fonts.css`. CSS files are basically style instructions that inform how HTML files (like our blog posts) should be rendered.

You can [see a demo of what the output from these defaults looks like ](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-lithium-theme/).

The `@font-face {}` sections describe the details of the font you're using: the name of the font face, its style and weight, and where the path to the files. The CSS file also specifies the fonts that certain HTML elements that should be styled with (e.g. `body` for body text). The sections between slashes and stars -- `/* example */` --  are just comments I've added and aren't integral to the code.

```{}
/* Default font 1 */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Merriweather';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Merriweather'), local('Merriweather-Regular'),
       url('../fonts/merriweather-v13-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('../fonts/merriweather-v13-latin-regular.woff') format('woff');
}

/* Default font 2 */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Lato';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Lato Regular'), local('Lato-Regular'),
       url('../fonts/lato-v11-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('../fonts/lato-v11-latin-regular.woff') format('woff');
}

/* Font to use for the body text */
body {
  font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;
}

/* Font to use for headings and other things */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, .nav, .article-duration, .archive-item-link, .footer {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
}
```

So the two default font faces for the Lithium theme are [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) (sans-serif) and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) (serif). Merriweather is being used for the body text and Lato for basically everything else (e.g. `h1` first level headers).

You can specify several font families for each HTML element. There are two in the example above: `font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;`. This instructs the system to display first your font of choice -- `Merriweather` in this case -- and to fall back to the system's default `serif` font if that fails to be displayed. There's nothing stopping you from adding several named fonts in preference order, separated by commas.

But who wants defaults? Let's get something different.

# Get font faces

For this demo, I'm using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) exclusively, but you can also use the excellent [Google Web Fonts Helper](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) app by [Mario Ranftl](https://mranftl.com/){target="_blank"}.

Once you're on a Google Fonts specimen page -- [like this one for Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) -- you can click 'SELECT THIS FONT' to add it to a list for later viewing. You can access this list at the bottom right of the page in a drawer that says 'X Families Selected', where 'X' is the number that you've selected.

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2018-11-29-typeface-change-for-hugo-lithium_files/font-family-select-tray.png" alt="Screenshot of the fonts tray on Google Fonts, showing Fira Sans."/>
<p class="caption">The font-family selection tray on Google Fonts with Fira Sans selected.</p>
</div>

There's some useful information in this drawer. For example, there are two chunks of CSS under 'EMBED': one to help embed the font and one to specify in CSS. You'll need this information later.

To download the font face, you can click 'CUSTOMIZE' in the tray to select which elements of the font family you want (light, medium, semi-bold, etc) and then click the download button (downward pointing arrow) in the upper right of the tray. This will download a .zip file containing your font faces in many file formats.

The .zip file contained lots of file types but we can get away with [copying the WOFF and WOFF2 files](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/) only. 'WOFF' stands for [Web Open Font Format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/WOFF), which is interpreted easily by modern web browsers.

Remember: we don't touch the `themes/` folder. Instead, make your updates in the `static/` folder instead. So put your WOFF and WOFF2 files in `static/fonts/`.

# Activate fonts

We have the files prepared and now we need to amend our `fonts.css` file to point to them. Again, amend the `static/` folder, not the `themes/` folder; that's where the defaults live. Instead, add your WOFF and WOFF2 files to `static/fonts/fonts.css`.

There should be an `@font-face` element for each font we want (you may want more than two). I've also added an instruction to display code blocks using the monospace font.

```
/* Updated font face 1 */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Roboto';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Roboto'), local('Roboto-Regular'),
       url('../fonts/roboto-v20-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Chrome 26+, Opera 23+, Firefox 39+ */
       url('../fonts/roboto-v20-latin-regular.woff') format('woff'); /* Chrome 6+, Firefox 3.6+, IE 9+, Safari 5.1+ */
}

/* Updated font face 2 */
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Lekton';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: local('Lekton'), local('Lekton-Regular'),
       url('../fonts/lekton-v10-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('../fonts/lekton-v10-latin-regular.woff') format('woff');
}


/* Set all body text to font face 1 */
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', serif;
}

/* Set other text formats to font face 2 */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, .nav, .article-duration, .archive-item-link, .article-meta, .footer {
  font-family: 'Lekton', monospace;
}

/* Set font face for code */
code {
  font-family: 'Lekton', monospace;
  font-size: 100%;
}

```

So I've chosen the monospace [Lekton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lekton) for code and headers and the serif [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for the body. I like Lekton's relative narrowness especially, along with its almost-square `{braces}`. Roboto is clean and clear, if ubiquitous.

I may change my mind at some point!
