>The food here is okay. Mostly I've been setting up [a single-page personal site](https://www.matt-dray.com/) with the [{postcards}](https://github.com/seankross/postcards) package for R, deploying it with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and setting up a custom domain with [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). More rain is forecast for tomorrow.

# Domain-driven development

A hobby of mine is to look for funny domain names and to not buy them.

Eventually I realised that [`matt-dray.com`](https://www.matt-dray.com) wasn't taken, so I figured I might as well squat it and do something pseudo-useful with it.[^mattdray]

Yes, I could write some HTML[^marquee] and CSS to make a complicated shrine to self-absorption, but why bother trying to center divs when [Sean Kross](https://twitter.com/seankross) has just announced [the {postcards} R package](https://github.com/seankross/postcards) to create nice, minimal landing pages?

This post is a short self-reminder of how to:

1. Generate a webpage with {postcards}
1. Deploy it with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
1. Point to it with a custom domain from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

This post isn't about the tubes and wires of the internet. It's more the how than the why. 

# Write a postcard

{postcards} provides some R Markdown templates that contain space for a photo, a mini-bio and some buttons to link out to your profiles elsewhere. See [the package's readme](https://github.com/seankross/postcards/blob/main/README.md) for examples.

You can install the development version from GitHub:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("seankross/postcards")
```

I generated an R Markdown file with [the 'Jolla' template](https://seankross.com/postcards-templates/jolla/) using the following line:

```{r templates, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("index.Rmd", "Jolla", package = "postcards")
```

Note that the file is called `index.Rmd` and will thus render to `index.html`. This is the default file that gets read when a site is visited.

In the YAML header of the template you can specify a `title`, which is likely to be your name; the `output` format, which is the name for our chosen {postcards} template; `links`, where you specify the wording and underlying links for the page's buttons; `image` for your bokeh-rich professional headshot and `favicon` for the little image that will appear alongside your page title in a browser tab.

```

  - Twitter: "https://twitter.com/mattdray/"
  - GitHub: "https://github.com/matt-dray/"
output:
  postcards::jolla

```

You can then write your mini bio in the body text of the document. I garnished mine with emoji via [Hadley Wickham's {emo} package](https://github.com/hadley/emo).

The {postcards} templates are ready to go out of the box but you can still tinker with the style. I decided to pull in a font, [Fantasque Sans Mono by Jany Belluz](https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans)[^font], and put a CSS chunk in the R Markdown to specify it.

<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">A preview of the 'Jolla' template. Tobi seems nice.</p>
</div>

The content and design of my page may change at any time, but I purposefully want it to be minimal and have a clean and simple appearance. The {postcards} package is also in development, so I look forward to testing out any new features that appear in future.

# Pop it in the post

You could put your site's files in a GitHub repo and [serve it with GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages). Upside: it's free. Downside: your URL will be in the form `username.github.io/your-postcard-repo`, which isn't particularly sleek.

Instead you could use a free service like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy a site from a GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repository and set up a custom domain to point at it. I've had prior success with Netlify for this blog, so that's why I'm using it here.

A bonus of this approach is [continuous deployment](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/09/17/continuous-deployment/): pushing changes to your repo causes Netlify to rebuild and deploy your site automatically, so you don't need to worry about it.

To set up my page, I signed into Netlify and I:

* clicked the 'New site from Git' button
* clicked 'GitHub' in section '1. Connect to Git provider', because that's where [my {postcards} repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/postcard) is stored
* selected my `github.com/matt-dray/postcard/` repo in section '2. Pick a repository' after authorising Netlify to connect to to it
* left the 'build command' empty in section '3. Build options and deploy!' and set the 'publish directory' to '/' (because I want to serve `index.html` from the root of the repo)
* clicked 'deploy site'

Netlify takes a moment to build and serve the site after you click 'deploy site'. It's served automatically from a URL in the form `random-name.netlify.app`[^random-name] but, as mentioned, you can configure a privately-owned domain name instead.

For more on these steps, including screenshots, see [Netlify's step-by-step guidance on deploying static and single-page sites](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/).

It's also worth mentioning [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop): a service that lets you simply drag and drop your site's files to deploy them, rather than needing to authorise Netlify to connect to your Git-based repo. This is quick and technically easier, but you'll have to drag and drop each time you want to update the site.

# Address it properly

There's a whole bunch of domain-name providers. I'm focusing here on [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), which is what I used to for this blog. After buying a domain, there's a little bit of back-and-forth required between Netlify and Namecheap.

In brief:

1. In your Namecheap account, click the 'Manage' button for your domain and set the dropdown in the 'Nameservers' section to 'Custom DNS'
1. In your Namecheap account, click 'Set up a custom domain', type it in and confirm
1. Click 'Set up Netlify DNS' alongside the domain and click through until you're provided a handful of nameserver strings
1. Back on Namecheap, copy-paste each of these into the 'Nameservers' section from step 1 and click the check mark to confirm
1. Wait.

It'll take a short while, but there'll be a sort of high-five between your domain and your site and then it'll be ready for viewing.

See [Ezekiel Ekunola's excellent blog post for a more thorough guide, which includes screenshots](https://www.blog.ezekielekunola.com/setting-up-domain-with-namecheap-and-netlify).

Note also that Netlify provides HTTPS for free too, which is [good for a number of reasons](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/https-ssl/#certificate-service-types), though the certificate can take a few hours to generate.

You can check your domain settings in Netlify at any time by clicking the site name in your account and then clicking the 'Domain settings' button.

# Post-postcard postscript

So this is a relatively quick way of generating up a single-page site with {postcards}; hosting the source on GitHub; deploying it with Netlify; and serving it via a custom domain bought from from Namecheap. 

This seems to work fine for me for now. Let me know if you have a better approach to generating and deploying simple single-page sites.

[^mattdray]: Dear other-Matt-Drays: you should know that we're in direct competition and I have to do what it takes to maximise my SEO and become the top Matt Dray globally.
[^marquee]: Free advice for your personal site: a liberal sprinkling of the `<marquee>` tag should definitely grab people's attention.
[^font]: I learnt about this via a GitHub star by [Alison Presmanes Hill](https://twitter.com/apreshill).
[^random-name]: You can change the random element to be more meaningful. For example, I changed it to [`matt-dray.netlify.app`](https://www.matt-dray.netlify.app/). You could stop there, but the whole point of using Netlify in this example is to set up a custom domain instead.
