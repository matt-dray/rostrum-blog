# TL;DR

Animals get stuck in weird places. Oh, and the `sf` package in R can be used in conjunction with `leaflet` for interactive mapping.

# The problem

I often work with data that has coordinates; usually a [column for eastings and a column for northings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easting_and_northing). Often I want to convert these to [latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude) and [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude) for interactive mapping using the [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). What might be an easy way to do this?

I'm going to demo the `sf` package, show how to reproject coordinates, work with points and polygon data, make an interactive map with `leaflet` and do a bonus bit of webscraping.

Mostly I wrote this post for my own reference and to learn a bit more about using `sf` package. Feel free to discuss or suggest anything in the comments.

# 'Special features'

I'm going to use the [`sf` ('special features') package](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf), which has a series of classes and methods for spatial data. Why? Simple feature access is a widely-used [ISO standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/40114.html) and the package supports the [tidy data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) paradigm and [tidyverse operations](https://www.tidyverse.org/). This and more was [spelled out by Edzer Pebesma (hte author of `sf`) in a post](https://edzer.github.io/UseR2017/) from [UseR! 2017](https://user2017.brussels/).

You can also get an opinion on whether you [should learn `sf` or `sp` for spatial R programming](http://www.seascapemodels.org/rstats/2018/03/23/should-I-learn-sp-or-sf.html) from Seascape Models.

# Some data

## Animal rescues

I've got an interesting example dataset that contains eastings and northings: [animal rescue incidents](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/resource/e6211993-9ea2-4ed4-9378-7344653e9c31) attended by the [London Fire Brigade](https://www.london-fire.gov.uk/incidents/) `r emo::ji("fire_engine")` from the excellent [London Data Store](https://data.london.gov.uk/). In their words:

> The London Fire Brigade attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call 'special services'). These 'special services' include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress.

This is pertinent because a pigeon recently fell down our chimney.

## Clean the data

First download the data from [the datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/resource/e6211993-9ea2-4ed4-9378-7344653e9c31). Then we can read it and clean the column names, one of which contains a rogue '£' (pounds sterling) symbol.

```{r read_data}
library(readr)  # for reading data
library(dplyr)  # data manipulation and pipes (%>%)
library(janitor)  # cleaning and misc functions
library(lubridate)  # dealing with dates

# read the csv
rescue <- readr::read_csv("data/lfb-animal-rescue.csv")

# replace rogue encoded '£' with blank
names(rescue) <- iconv(names(rescue), to = "ASCII", sub = "")

# more cleaning
rescue <- rescue %>% 
  rename(IncidentNominalCost = `IncidentNominalCost()`) %>%  # no brackets
  mutate(DateTimeOfCall = lubridate::ymd_hms(DateTimeOfCall))  # convert type

# preview
glimpse(rescue) 
```

So each row is an 'incident' to which the brigade were called and there are various columns for when, what, and where.

## Explore the data

This post isn't about the dataset, but it's worth having a closer look at it. I've added an interactive table below so you can filter and search for incidents, creatures, locations and the nominal cost of the callout.

```{r datatable, echo=FALSE}
# interactive table
rescue %>%
  mutate(  # allows for dropdown on interactive table
    Animal = as.factor(AnimalGroupParent),
    Borough = as.factor(Borough),
    IncidentNominalCost = ifelse(
      test = IncidentNominalCost == "NULL",
      yes = NA,
      no = as.numeric(IncidentNominalCost)
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(
    Incident = FinalDescription,
    Animal,
    Borough,
    `Nominal cost (£)` = IncidentNominalCost
  ) %>% 
  DT::datatable(
    filter = "top",
    rownames = FALSE,
    caption = "Filter using the boxes under the column headers or the search box in the top right",
    options = list(
      autoWidth = TRUE,
      pageLength = 5
    )
  )
```
<p>
<p>
Obviously there are plenty of cats up trees, but there's so much more. Some of the more unique entries are:

> DOG WITH JAW TRAPPED IN MAGAZINE RACK `r paste(emo::ji("dog"), emo::ji("newspaper"))`

> SWAN IN DISTRESS `r paste(emo::ji("duck"), emo::ji("confounded"))`

> FERRET STUCK IN LIFT SHAFT [ferret emoji needed]

And of course:

> TWO DOGS IN TOILET ELDERLY LADY INVOLVED `r paste(emo::ji("dog2"), emo::ji("poodle"), emo::ji("toilet"), emo::ji("older_woman"))`

Hmmm. `r emo::ji("thinking_face")`

# The `sf` package

## Points

### 'sf' class and reprojection

A  [Coordinate Reference System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system) (CRS) is required to project geographic entities -- points, polygons, etc -- onto a surface. There are many systems for doing this, from local to gloabl, each with its own CRS code. This isn't a post about geography and projections, but you can read more in the CRS chapter of [rspatial.org](http://rspatial.org/spatial/rst/6-crs.html).

First we convert the data to the sf class using the `st_as_sf` function, referencing theCRS code for eastings-northings. We can use the `st_transform()` function to convert our coordinates to latitude-longitude simply by referencing its CRS code. 

```{r}
library(sf)

rescue_sf <- rescue %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf(
    coords = c("Easting_rounded", "Northing_rounded"),  # columns with coordinates
    crs = 27700  # coordinate reference system code for eastings/northings
  ) %>% 
  sf::st_transform(crs = 4326)  # the coord ref system code for latlong

print(rescue_sf)
```

So what happened?

Our eastings and northings have been combined with `st_as_sf()` into a two element [list-column](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls13_list-columns.html) called `geometry` that has type `sfc_POINT`. Our object also contains some metadata detailing the geometry type -- points in our case -- and the projection system of the coordinate data, which we converted to latlong with the `st_transform()` function.

Functions in the the `sf` package add an additional class -- the 'sf' class -- to our dataframe-class object. This makes it possible to perform spatial analysis.

### Tidyverse manipulation

As mentiond, one advantage of using `sf` is that sf-class objects use the [tidy data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) paradigm that allows for manipulation using elements of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). This is a familiar and simple concept to grasp for many people, particularly R beginners. Conversely, the `sp` package creates the 'Spatial Points Data Frame' (SPDF) class for points data. SPDFs are an [S4 class](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html), which means they have 'slots' of data, coordinates, etc. This is probably slightly less wieldy for beginners.

So for example we can use the `filter()` function on our sf object.

```{r dplyr}
filtered_sf <- rescue_sf %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    AnimalGroupParent %in% c("Dog", "Cat", "Bird"),  # just these animals
    DateTimeOfCall > lubridate::ymd("2017-01-01") &
      DateTimeOfCall < lubridate::ymd("2017-12-31")  # 2017 only
  )
```

We can also use the `st_coordinates` function to extract the XY (latitude and longitude) coordinates from the column containing our `sf` point geometry. This means we have separate columns for the latitude and longitude.

```{r st_coordinates}
# extract coordinates into two-column dataframe
rescue_coords <- as.data.frame(st_coordinates(filtered_sf))

# bind these to rescue dataset
filtered_sf <- dplyr::bind_cols(filtered_sf, rescue_coords)

# preview
head(filtered_sf)
```

## Polygons 

### Read and convert GeoJSON

While we're messing around with the `sf` package we can add in the borders for each of the London boroughs from a [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) file.

We can do this by reading [Local Authority Districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_England) (LADs) driectly from the [Open Geography Portal](http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/) and then use the `st_as_sf()` function to make the conversion from the sp class to the sf class. This means our polygon dataset is a tidy dataframe with the polygon information stored as MULTIPOLYGON type in a list-column with as many elements as required to draw each polygon (e.g. a square requires four sets of XY points that can be joined together).

```{r geojson}
library(geojsonio)  # for working with geojson files

# read geojson from the web (local authorities)
lad_json <- geojsonio::geojson_read(
  x = "https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/fab4feab211c4899b602ecfbfbc420a3_4.geojson",
  what = "sp"  # spatial class
)

# convert to sf
lad_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(lad_json)

# preview
head(lad_sf)
```

### Scrape London borough list

But which of these LADs are London boroughs? We can extract a vector of the boroughs from Wikipedia using the [`rvest`](http://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/) package and use it to filter our data. The CSS selector used in `html_nodes()` can be extracted using the very handy [`SelectorGadget` tool](http://selectorgadget.com/).

```{r boroughs}
library(rvest)  # scraping webpages
library(xml2)  # parsing XML

# read the webpage
wiki <- xml2::read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_London_boroughs")

# get borough names
boroughs <- wiki %>% 
  rvest::html_nodes(css = "td:nth-child(1) > a") %>%
  rvest::html_text() %>% 
  tolower()

# filter the sf for london boroughs
boroughs_sf <- lad_sf %>% 
  mutate(lad17nm = tolower(lad17nm)) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(lad17nm %in% boroughs)

# preview
head(boroughs_sf)
```

# Map it

So now we can plot the data. The `addPolygons()` function accepts each `MULTIPOLYGON` in the list-column of our London boroughs dataset.  The `addMarkers()` function accepts the POINTS-type list-column to plot each point at the latitude and longitude specified.

This is a very simple map for now. You can:

* zoom with the `+` and `-` buttons or scroll with your mouse wheel
* click and drag to move the map
* click the points to get a pop-up showing more information
* hover over a borough to highlight it and show a label

```{r leaflet}
library(leaflet)  # for interactive mapping

# put the map together
leaflet::leaflet(boroughs_sf) %>% 
  leaflet::addTiles() %>%
  leaflet::addPolygons(  # add London borough boundaries
    label = ~tools::toTitleCase(lad17nm),  # label on hover
    color = "black",  # boundary colour
    weight = 2,  # boundary thickness
    opacity = 1,  # fully opaque lines
    fillOpacity = 0.2,  # mostly transparent
    highlightOptions = highlightOptions(
      color = "white",  # turn boundary white on hover
      weight = 2,  # same as polygon boundary
      bringToFront = TRUE  # overlay the highglight
    )
  ) %>% 
  leaflet::addAwesomeMarkers( # add incident points
    lng = filtered_sf$X, lat = filtered_sf$Y,
    icon = leaflet::awesomeIcons(
      library = "ion",  # from this icon library
      icon = "ion-android-alert",  # use this icon
      iconColor = "white",  # colour it white
      # colour by animal
      markerColor = case_when(  # different colours for each
        filtered_sf$AnimalGroupParent == "Dog" ~ "red",
        filtered_sf$AnimalGroupParent == "Cat" ~ "blue",
        filtered_sf$AnimalGroupParent == "Bird" ~ "black"
      )
    ),
    popup = ~paste0(  # display this information on click
      "<b>Animal</b>: ", filtered_sf$AnimalGroupParent, "<br>",
      "<b>Incident</b>: ", filtered_sf$FinalDescription, "<br>",
      "<b>Date</b>: ", filtered_sf$DateTimeOfCall, "<br>",
      "<b>Borough</b>: ", filtered_sf$Borough, "<br>",
      "<b>Nominal cost</b>: £", filtered_sf$IncidentNominalCost
    )
  )
```
<p>

Okay cool, we get a simple map of London with borough boundaries and markers showing incidents in 2017, with a different colour for each of three selected animal groups.

# And remember

My main advice? _Keep an eye on your pets. And consider covering your chimney_.
