# tl;dr

* I gave a talk about creating an R package with helper functions from [the {usethis} package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/){target="_blank"}
* In the session I created a new package from scratch called {cabinet} for identifying the cats that live in the UK Government's [Cabinet Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office)
* [See the slides in a dedicated window](https://matt-dray.github.io/r-pkg-slides/#1){target="_blank"} or [view their source](https://github.com/matt-dray/r-pkg-slides){target="_blank"}
* See the [{cabinet} package source](https://github.com/matt-dray/cabinet){target="_blank"} and its [website](https://matt-dray.github.io/cabinet/){target="_blank"}

# Coffee packaging

I gave a talk at a [Cabinet Office Coffee & Coding session](https://co-analysis.github.io/co-coffee-and-coding/){target="_blank"} about building R packages from scratch. The emphasis was on [the {usethis} package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/){target="_blank"}, which contains lots of package-setup functions that make your life easier.

The focus is on beginners who may never have written a package before.

Click on the slides embedded below and cycle through with your arrow keys, or [you can open them fullscreen in a dedicated browser tab](https://matt-dray.github.io/r-pkg-slides/#1){target="_blank"}. Press the 'P' button your keyboard to see the presenter notes.

I made the slides using [Yihui Xie's {xaringan} implementation of remark.js](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/){target="_blank"} and I used my own {gdstheme} package for the theme ([read the blog](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/05/24/xaringan-template/){target="_blank"} or [see the source on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/gdstheme){target="_blank"}). 

# Talk summary

Basically you can make a minimal R package with only:

* `usethis::create_package()` to set up the minimal package structure
* `usethis::create_r()` to set up a script for your functions
* `devtools::document()` to generate minimal documentation from your files

The {usethis} package also helps you set up internal and long-form documentation, testing, version control, a GitHub repository and more. {pkgdown} even generates a website from your documentation to make it more user-friendly.

# Cat-egorise

In the session I live-built a package called {cabinet}. You can:

* look at the package's [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/cabinet/){target="_blank"}
* see the package's [website](https://matt-dray.github.io/cabinet/){target="_blank"}, made with {pkgdown}
* install the package yourself with `remotes::install_github("matt-dray/cabinet")`

The package only has one (very important) function, `cabinet_cat()`, which checks whether a supplied character string matches the name of either of [the Cabinet Office's cats](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38262832){target="_blank"}.

Like:

```{r}
# remotes::install_github("matt-dray/cabinet)
library(cabinet)
cabinet_cat("Ossie")
cabinet_cat("Larry")
cabinet_cat("Garfield")
```

# Excellent resources {#resources}

There are some really good resources out there already. I like the following:

* Hilary Parker's [post](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/){target="_blank"} to write a package from scratch (beginner)
* Tomas Westlake's [update](https://r-mageddon.netlify.com/post/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/){target="_blank"} to Hilary's post (beginner)
* Emil Hvitfeldt's [post](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/usethis-workflow-for-package-development/){target="_blank"}, focusing on {usethis} (beginner/intermediate)
* Karl Broman's [site](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/){target="_blank"}, a primer for package developement (intermediate)
* Hadley Wickham's [book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/){target="_blank"} (intermediate/advanced)

Tom's post is probably the best place to start if you want to create a package with {usethis} from scratch as a beginner.
