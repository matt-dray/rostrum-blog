I gave a talk at a [Cabinet Office Coffee & Coding session](https://co-analysis.github.io/co-coffee-and-coding/). It was about how to make an R package easily, with help from the {usethis} package in particular.

Click on the slides embedded below and cycle through with your arrow keys, or [you can open them fullscreen in a dedicated browser tab](https://matt-dray.github.io/r-pkg-slides/#1). Press 'P' to see presenter notes.

In the session I live-built a package called {cabinet} and pushed it to GitHub. You can:

* look at the package's [source code](https://github.com/matt-dray/cabinet/)
* see the package's [website](https://matt-dray.github.io/cabinet/), made with {pkgdown}
* install the package with `remotes::install_github("matt-dray/cabinet")`
