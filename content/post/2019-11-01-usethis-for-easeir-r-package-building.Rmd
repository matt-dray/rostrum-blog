# Coffee packaging

I gave a talk at a [Cabinet Office Coffee & Coding session](https://co-analysis.github.io/co-coffee-and-coding/){target="_blank"} about building R packages. The emphasis was on the {usethis} package, which contains lots of package-setup functions that make your life easier.

Click on the slides embedded below and cycle through with your arrow keys, or [you can open them fullscreen in a dedicated browser tab](https://matt-dray.github.io/r-pkg-slides/#1){target="_blank"}.

# Talk summary

Basically you can make a minimal R package with only:

* `usethis::create_package()` to set up the minimal package structure
* `usethis::create_r()` to set up a script for your functions
* `devtools::document()` to generate minimal documentation from your files

The {usethis} package also helps you set up internal and long-form documentation, testing, version control, a GitHub repository and more. {pkgdown} even generates a website from your documentation to make it more user-friendly.

# Cat-egorise

In the session I live-built a package called {cabinet}. You can:

* look at the package's [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/cabinet/){target="_blank"}
* see the package's [website](https://matt-dray.github.io/cabinet/){target="_blank"}, made with {pkgdown}
* install the package yourself with `remotes::install_github("matt-dray/cabinet")`

The package only has one (very important) function, `cabinet_cat()`, which checks whether a supplied character string matches the name of either of [the Cabinet Office's cats](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38262832){target="_blank"}.

Like:

```{r}
library(cabinet)
cabinet_cat("Ossie")
cabinet_cat("Larry")
cabinet_cat("Garfield")
```

# Excellent resources

There are some really good resources out there already. I like the following:

* Hilary Parker's [post](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/){target="_blank"} (beginner)
* Tomas Westlake's [update](https://r-mageddon.netlify.com/post/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/){target="_blank"} (beginner)
* Karl Broman's [site](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/){target="_blank"} (intermediate)
* Hadley Wickham's [book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/){target="_blank"} (intermediate/advanced)

Tom's post is probably the best place to start if you want to create a package with {usethis}.
