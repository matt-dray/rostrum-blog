<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>You can create simple Twitter bots with GitHub Actions. I made <a href="https://www.twitter.com/londonmapbot">@londonmapbot</a>.</p>

<h1>London from (socially-distant) space</h1>
<p>I’ve wanted to make a Twitter bot for a while, but it seemed like Hard Work.</p>
<p>Finally I’ve made <a href="https://www.twitter.com/londonmapbot">@londonmapbot</a>: a completely unsophisticated proof-of-concept Twitter bot that continues my learning about GitHub Actions from <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/08/09/ghactions-pkgs/">a previous post</a>.</p>
<p>What does it do? It posts a satellite image of a random bit of Greater London every half hour. just take in the aesthetics of spaghetti streets intermingled with green space, or you can try to guess where it is. For example, what’s the location of this image from <a href="https://twitter.com/londonmapbot/status/1309199157530431489?s=20">an existing @londonmapbot tweet</a>?<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

</p>
</div>
<p>So how does this thing work? A scheduled action runs code to generate random coordinates, send them to the <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static-images">Mapbox API</a>, retrieve an image, and then post it via the Twitter API, which is accessed through the R package <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/">{rtweet}</a>. The source code is just <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot">a single YAML file</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-components" class="section level1">
<h1>The components</h1>
<p>Three things go into @londonmapbot: GitHub Actions, {rtweet} and Mapbox.</p>
<div id="github-actions" class="section level2">
<h2>GitHub Actions</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a> is a platform for automating workflows. You can write a little YAML file that executes code on a trigger, like when you <code>git push</code> to your repo. I’ve written before about <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/08/09/ghactions-pkgs/">using GitHub Actions for continuous integration of R packages</a>, for example.</p>
<p>You can also schedule a trigger with a <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron job</a>. I took advantage of this for @londonmapbot, which executes every half-hour.</p>
<p>Here’s an abridged version of <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/.github/workflows/londonmapbot.yml">the YAML file</a>:</p>
<pre><code>name: londonmapbot

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: &#39;0,30 * * * *&#39;

jobs:
  londonmapbot-post:
    runs-on: macOS-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master
      - name: Generate and post tweet
        run: Rscript -e &#39;&lt;R code to execute&gt;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This reads like:</p>
<ul>
<li>this action is called ‘londonmapbot’</li>
<li>run this code every half-hour on :00 and :30</li>
<li>the first (and only) job in this action is called londonmapbot-post</li>
<li>start up a remote machine should with the macOS operating system installed</li>
<li>the steps of the job are to:
<ul>
<li>use <a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout">some pre-written code by GitHub</a> to check out the repo to the remote machine</li>
<li>use <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/actions">some prewritten code from r-lib</a> that sets up R on the remote machine</li>
<li>run the provided R code with a system call</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>GitHub recognises the YAML as an action when placed at the path <code>.github/workflows/</code> and it will start running it.</p>
<p>I should note that there are already <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?query=tweet">actions on the GitHub Marketplace for tweeting</a>, but they don’t quite do what I want. I also wanted to write the juicy bit with R code, which I’m most familiar with.</p>
</div>
<div id="rtweet" class="section level2">
<h2>{rtweet}</h2>
<p>The package <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/">{rtweet}</a> was created by <a href="https://mikewk.com/">Mike Kearney</a> and contains functions to interact with <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api">the Twitter API</a> from R. You can fetch data like tweet content, friend counts and favourites, and also post tweets.</p>
<p>You need a Twitter account and to <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access">sign up as a Twitter developer</a> if you want to use the API. Then you can <a href="developer.twitter.com/en/apps">create an ‘app’</a> to obtain ‘tokens’ or ‘keys’, which are long alphanumeric ‘passwords’ that grant access to the API.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>rtweet::create_token()</code> function to supply these keys to the environment and they’ll be used each time you use a function that calls the API.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Install the package from CRAN
install.packages(&quot;rtweet&quot;)

# Supply keys to the environment
rtweet::create_token(
  app = &quot;londonmapbot&quot;,  # the name of the Twitter app
  consumer_key = &quot;TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY&quot;,
  consumer_secret = &quot;TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_SECRET&quot;,
  access_token = &quot;TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot;,
  access_secret = &quot;TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET&quot;
)

# Example: post a tweet via the API
rtweet::post_tweet(status = &quot;This is a test tweet.&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you need to supply your keys where I’ve put placeholders in the above code. That might be okay for interactive coding on your local machine, but you don’t want to expose these to the world when you put them on GitHub. We’ll talk about how to do this in the ‘secrets’ section below.</p>
</div>
<div id="mapbox" class="section level2">
<h2>Mapbox</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> is a company with services for mapping, geocoding and navigation, which developers can use for integrating into their apps for things like asset tracking, route optimisation or anything that requires a map interface for users.</p>
<p>Again, you’ll need to set up a Mapbox account to get a key for using the API. While the target audience is largely commercial, there’s a generous allowance of 50,000 free requests for static satellite images.</p>
<p>You can pass parameters to the Mapbox API via a URL. This is well explained in <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static-images">the Mapbox Documentation</a>, which has <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/playground/static/">an excellent ‘playground’ interface</a> for you to test out your call.</p>
<p>The format to get a static image is:</p>
<pre><code>/styles/v1/{username}/{style_id}/static/{overlay}/{lon},{lat},{zoom},{bearing},{pitch}|{auto}/{width}x{height}{@2x}</code></pre>
<p>You alter the terms in curly brackets for your purposes. So <code>lon</code>gitude and <code>lat</code>itude of <code>-123.1387</code> and <code>49.3037</code> will get you a <code>300x200</code> pixel <code>satellite</code> image of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Park">Stanley Park in Vancouver, Canada</a>:</p>
<pre><code>https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9/static/-123.1387,49.3037,12,0/300x200@2x?access_token=YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN</code></pre>
<p>Visiting the URL returns the requested image as a JPEG:</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Except I lied: it actually doesn’t. You’ll need to replace the access-token placeholder (on the end of the URL) with your own Mapbox token. But, just like your Twitter keys, you’ll want to keep these safe from prying eyes. How?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="secrets" class="section level1">
<h1>Secrets</h1>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets">Github lets you store secrets securely</a> in the ‘Secrets’ section of the ‘Settings’ tab in your repo. No-one can see these, but they can be called into your code when it runs.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2020-09-21-londonmapbot_files/secrets-github.png" alt="The GitHub website opened in the Secrets section of the Settings menu, with an example Mapbox token name being shown." width="100%"/>
<p class="caption">
Keep it secret… keep it safe.
</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s look at one of the Twitter keys as an example. You could save as a secret your consumer API key with the name <code>TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY</code>. In your GitHub Actions YAML file, you can then use the form <code>${{ secrets.TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY }}</code> in place of where you would add a secret. Running the action results in the secret being pulled and decrypted from your secrets stash.</p>
</div>
<div id="londonmapbot-in-action" class="section level1">
<h1>londonmapbot in action</h1>
<p>So, to summarise, you can put that all together and you get a GitHub Action that every half-hour is triggered to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Generate some random coordinates within (roughly) Greater London</li>
<li>Send these to the Mapbox API in a URL</li>
<li>Download the resulting image in a temporary location</li>
<li>Pass the image as media to be posted by <code>rtweet::post_tweet()</code> to <a href="https://www.twitter.com/londonmapbot">the @londonmapbot account</a></li>
</ol>
<p>A bad analogy is that I’m Frankenstein; Mapbox, Twitter and {rtweet} are bodyparts; GitHub Actions is electricity; and @londonmapbot is my resulting monster.</p>
<div id="naughty-botlazy-programmer" class="section level2">
<h2>Naughty bot/lazy programmer</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t post successfully 100% of the time. You can see why by checking the actions log, which is accessed from <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/actions">the ‘Actions’ tab on the repo</a>. The failed ones, with red crosses, seem mostly due to an ‘empty reply from server’. I’m okay with this for now.</p>
<p>I’m also mildly ashamed of just passing all the R code as a single line in the YAML file. I had one or two issues with object persistence when I tried breaking this into separate lines and separate steps of the YAML file. I know it can be done more tidily though.</p>
<p>Do give me suggestions and pull requests, or tell me how good you are at identifying the granular location in each image.</p>
