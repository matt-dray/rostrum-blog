<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/drake">{drake}</a> package records file interdependecies in your analysis. When files are changed, {drake} only re-runs the parts of your analysis that need to be re-run. This saves time and reduces error.</p>
<p>I think {drake} has potential for <a href="https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/">Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)</a>, an automated approach to producing UK government statistics that minimises error and speeds production.</p>

<h1>Make it to make it</h1>
<p>Analysis projects can become complicated as multiple inputs, script files and outputs build up.</p>
<p>Can you remember exactly which scripts need to be re-executed after a file changes? Or will you have to re-run the entire project from scratch? This is tedious and open to error if you miss something.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile">‘makefile’</a> can help you. In short, it’s a text file in which you write each step of your analysis in a recipe-like format. Dependencies between data, code and outputs are recorded.</p>
<p>A makefile ensures that only the affected file and those downstream from it will be re-executed. This saves compute time and means you don’t have to remember any dependencies yourself.</p>

<h1>{drake} it to make it</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ropensci/drake">{drake}</a> is a package by <a href="https://wlandau.github.io/">Will Landau</a> that gives you makefiles with R syntax.</p>
<p>This post contains a very simple example of {drake} in action, but there’s so much more to it. Fortunately, there’s lots of resources:</p>

<h1>Demo: {drake} lays an egg</h1>
<p>I think there’s potential for {drake} in <a href="https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/">Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)</a>: a wholly code-based method for producing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics">the UK government’s statistical reports</a> that improves reproducibility and automation, minimises errors and speeds-up production.</p>
<p>I’ve made a very simple {drake} demo for an imaginary RAP project. The demo recreates a very small part of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/egg-statistics">statistical publication that tracks UK egg production</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The demo code is on <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap">GitHub</a>, along with an <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/drake-egg-rap/egg-report.html">HTML version of the demo report</a>. Here’s a screenshot:</p>

<div id="prep" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Prepare the scripts</h2>
<p>The repo has <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/tree/master/R">three simple scripts</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> containing the code for the analysis:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/R/packages.R"><code>packages.R</code></a> loads the packages we need for our analysis with <code>library()</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/R/functions.R"><code>functions.R</code></a> contains our own custom functions</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/egg-report.Rmd">egg-report.Rmd</a> is the R Markdown report that will be output to HTML</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/R/plan.R"><code>plan.R</code></a> is where the steps of the analysis are written</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>plan.R</code> file needs a little more explanation. It contains the <code>drake_plan()</code> function, to which you pass each function required for the analysis. The functions can be in any order; {drake} works out the order from the dependencies between the scripts and outputs.</p>
<p>The demo plan is very simple, with only four functions wrapped inside <code>drake_plan()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>egg_plan &lt;- drake_plan(  # Create a drake_plan object called egg_plan
  
  # 1. Read the dataset
  raw_data = read_ods(
    path = &quot;data/eggs-packers-02may19a.ods&quot;,
    sheet = &quot;Packers_Annual&quot;,
    skip = 8
  ),  # separate each function with a comma
  
  # 2. Prepare the data with a bespoke function
  # from the functions.R file
  data = clean_data(raw_data),
  
  # 3. Generate a plot using a bespoke function
  # from the functions.R file
  plot = create_plot(data),
  
  # 4. Finally, render the R Markdown report
  # drake::knitr_in() marks the .Rmd file as a dependency
  # drake::file_out() marks the .HTML as an output
  report = rmarkdown::render(
    knitr_in(&quot;egg-report.Rmd&quot;),
    output_file = file_out(&quot;docs/egg-report.html&quot;),
    quiet = TRUE
  )

)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="source" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Load the scripts</h2>
<p>The data and code are all in place. How do we run the analysis?</p>
<p>Everything we need is stored in <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/make.R">a small file called <code>make.R</code></a>. It starts by calling <code>source()</code> for each R script:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>source(packages.R)   # load the packages
source(functions.R)  # load the bespoke functions
source(plan.R)       # load the plan</code></pre>
<p>Sourcing the plan file results in the <code>drake_plan()</code> function being run. The output is a special <code>drake_plan</code> data frame object, which is called <code>egg_plan</code> in our demo. It has columns called ‘target’ and ‘command’ and a row for each function in our analysis:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>egg_plan</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># A tibble: 4 x 2
  target   command                                                                           
  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;expr&gt;                                                                            
1 raw_data read_ods(path = &quot;data/eggs-packers-02may19a.ods&quot;, sheet = &quot;Packers_Annual&quot;,      …
2 data     clean_data(raw_data)                                                             …
3 plot     create_plot(data)                                                                …
4 report   render(knitr_in(&quot;egg-report.Rmd&quot;), output_file = file_out(&quot;docs/egg-report.html&quot;)…</code></pre>
<p>The plan object acts like an instruction booklet, which can be read ‘to each target (data and outputs), apply the named command (the functions of the analysis)’. So the contents of the <code>egg_plan</code> data frame can be read</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the raw data (the target) with <code>readODS::read_ods()</code> (the command)</li>
<li>Clean the data (target) with the custom <code>clean_data()</code> function (command)</li>
<li>Plot the data (target) with the custom <code>plot_data()</code> function (command)</li>
<li>Create an R Markdown report (target) with <code>rmarkdown::render()</code> (command)</li>
</ol>
<p>So we have the instructions stored in an object. We can (optionally) produce a dependency graph of these targets to get an idea of the relationships between the elements of the analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="viz" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Visualise</h2>
<p>First we can extract information about the <code>egg_plan</code> to a configuration (‘config’) list object with <code>drake_config()</code>. One element of the config is, for example, an <a href="https://igraph.org/">igraph</a> object that helps construct graphs from your workflow.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>egg_config &lt;- drake_config(egg_plan)</code></pre>
<p>A number of {drake} functions can take the config object and do something with the information inside it. In our case, we’re going to pass the config to <code>vis_drake_graph()</code>, which builds an interactive dependency graph using {visNetwork}.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vis_drake_graph(egg_config)</code></pre>
<p>This generates an interactive output <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/drake-egg-rap/dependency-graph.html">(see it here)</a>. Here’s a screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-22-can-drake-rap_files/dependency-static.png" /></p>
<p>The visualisation is shape-coded by target type (e.g. functions are triangles) and colour-coded to show whether everything is up-to-date (e.g. green if it is). Arrows show the file dependencies (e.g. both the <code>clean_data</code> fcuntion and <code>raw_data</code> file come together to produce the <code>data</code> object).</p>
</div>
<div id="make" class="section level2">
<h2>4. Make the plan</h2>
<p>Having satisfied that the plan looks correct, running the plan is as simple as:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>make(plan)</code></pre>
<p>This runs all the instructions laid out in the <code>plan</code> object. All the commands are run on the corresponding targets.</p>
<p>Where do the outputs go? In our case, we specifically asked for the HTML report – generated from the R Markdown file – to be written to the <code>docs/</code> folder. The other objects are cached in a <code>.drake/</code> folder so they can be retrieved without needing to be re-created.</p>
<p>So, re-running the plan straight away again does… nothing. No code needs to be re-executed if nothing’s changed! The outputs, and the cache in <code>.drake/</code>, are fully up to date.</p>
</div>
<div id="change" class="section level2">
<h2>5. Make a change</h2>
<p>If anything changes in our data or code then the downstream targets will be out of sync. Let’s pretend we’ve changed a line of code in the <code>create_plot()</code> function, perhaps to alter its title. What do you think will happen?</p>
<p>Well, {drake} knows there’s been a change. You can check this by running <code>outdated(egg_config)</code>, which prints the name of the altered file plus the other files impacted by it.</p>
<p>We can see this by recreating the dependency graph <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/drake-egg-rap/dependency-graph-outdated.html">(see it here)</a>: the <code>plot</code> target is outdated, as are the targets downstream that depend on it (<code>report</code> and the <code>egg-report.html</code> file). This is indicated by them being coloured black. Here’s a static version:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-07-22-can-drake-rap_files/dependency-outdated-static.png" /></p>
<p>So now we can see the real power of {drake}, as re-running the plan now will regenerate only the outdated files.</p>
<p>Where are the targets stored that didn’t need to be recreated? Turns out that {drake} creates a <code>.drake/</code> folder to caches these objects and grabs then when needed.</p>
<p>Items can be pulled from this cache by the user with the the <code>loadd()</code> and <code>readd()</code> functions. For example, the R Markdown report in my example simply calls the rendered plot object from the cache using <code>readd()</code>. This can help keep the R Markdown file less cluttered and more readable.</p>

<div id="in-review" class="section level1">
<h1>In review</h1>
<p>This post has shown how {drake}:</p>
<ul>
<li>remembers the dependencies between the files of your analysis</li>
<li>only re-runs what needs to be re-run</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this alone can help build the reliability and trustworthiness of published statistical reports.</p>
<p>Of course, this shoul dbe considered the starting point, since <a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/">{drake} does a lot more</a>.</p>
