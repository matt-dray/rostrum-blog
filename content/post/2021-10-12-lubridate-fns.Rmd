# tl;dr

I used [{itdepends}](https://github.com/r-lib/itdepends) to see how CRAN packages depend on [{lubridate}](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/), which [was _not_ removed from CRAN](What if [the {lubridate} package was removed from CRAN](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate/issues/998)?) recently.

# Lubrigate

A test failure in [{lubridate}](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) led to hundreds of R developers being emailed about [its potential expulsion from CRAN](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate/issues/998), which also threatened the hundreds of packages that depend on it. 

I see the benefit of minimising dependencies. I also understand the drawbacks of reinventing the wheel. Maybe {lubridate} is a good dependency: a simple API, part of the popular {tidyverse}, and it handles stuff you can't be bothered with (like what's 29 February plus one year?).

[Jim Hester spoke at rstudio::conf(2019) about dependencies](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/05/itdepends/). His [{itdepends}](https://github.com/r-lib/itdepends) package helps you understand their scale and impact on your package.[^tim]

So, for fun, I'm looking at how {lubridate} is used by packages that import it.

# CRANk it up

`CRAN_package_db()` is a convenient function that returns information about packages available on CRAN. We can filter it for the packages that import {lubridate}, i.e. they have {lubridate} in the `Imports` section of their DESCRIPTION file.

```{r cran-db}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)

cran <- tools::CRAN_package_db()

imports_lubridate <- cran |> 
  filter(str_detect(Imports, "lubridate")) |> 
  pull(Package)

sample(imports_lubridate, 5)  # random sample
```

Right, so that's `r length(imports_lubridate)` packages out of `r nrow(cran)` (`r 100 * round(length(imports_lubridate) / nrow(cran), 2)`%). Is that a lot? Well, the tidyverse package {dplyr}, the Swiss Army knife of data wrangling, is listed in the `Imports` of `r cran |> filter(str_detect(Imports, "dplyr")) |> nrow()`.

# InstALL

So, perhaps this is a little nuts, but we're going to install _all_ the {lubridate}-dependent packages because {itdepends} works with locally-installed packages.

```{r install-packages, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE}
tmp <- tempdir()  # temporary folder

purrr::walk(
  imports_lubridate,
  ~install.packages(
    .x, 
    destdir = tmp, 
    dependencies = FALSE,  # skip installing dependencies
    repos = "https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/"  # mirror
  )
)
```

This takes a little while. There's probably faster methods, like maybe [the {pak} package](https://pak.r-lib.org/), but for now I just used what worked. I've also hidden the output, obviously. It's also possible that some packages will error out and won't install. Oh no! Ah well.

# It depends on {itdepends}

{itdepends} is not available from CRAN, but you can install from GitHub.

```{r install-itdepends, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("jimhester/itdepends")
```

Now we can pass each of package name to the `dep_usage_package()` function of {itdepends} in a loop. We get back a dataframe for each package, listing each function call it makes and the package that the function comes from.

I've added a mildly unorthodox use of `next`, [borrowed from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55937737), because I was having trouble with the loop after a failure.

```{r itdepends-loop, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
dep_list <- vector("list", length(imports_lubridate)) |> 
  setNames(imports_lubridate)

for (i in imports_lubridate) {
  
  skip <- FALSE
  
  tryCatch({ 
    dep_list[[i]] <- itdepends::dep_usage_pkg(i)
    dep_list[[i]]$focus <- i
  },
  error = function(e) { 
    dep_list[[i]] <- data.frame(
      pkg   = NA_character_,
      fun   = NA_character_,
      focus = NA_character_
    )
    skip <<- TRUE 
  })
  
  if (skip) next
  
}
```

I absolutely do not claim this to be the best, most optimised approach. But it works for me.

# Dependensheeesh

Now that {itdepends} has extracted all the function calls from each of the packages, we can take a look at their frequencies.

## Example

Here's the top 10 most-used functions from the first package alphabetically: [{academictwitteR}](https://github.com/cjbarrie/academictwitteR).

```{r ex-count-fn}
ex_pkg <- "academictwitteR"

dep_list[[ex_pkg]] |> 
  count(pkg, fun, sort = TRUE) |>
  slice(1:5)
```

It's not particularly exciting to know that the top 5 are made up of base R functions like the assignment arrow (`<-`), the dollar-sign (`$`) data accessor[^nzd] and the square bracket (`[`). We also don't really care about the package's internal functions. Let's filter out these packages and re-count

```{r ex-count-fn-no-base}
base_pkgs <- sessionInfo()$basePkgs

dep_list[[ex_pkg]] |>
  filter(!pkg %in% c(base_pkgs, ex_pkg)) |> 
  count(pkg, fun, sort = TRUE) |> 
  slice(1:10)
```

Aha. We can see immediately that the authors have made use of tidyverse to write their package, since you can see {dplyr}, {tibble}, etc, in there. This makes the use of {lubridate} relatively unsurprising. 

Here's the {lubridate} functions used by this package.

```{r ex-count-lubridate}
dep_list[[ex_pkg]] |>
  filter(pkg == "lubridate") |> 
  count(pkg, fun, sort = TRUE)
```

So this package uses four {lubridate} functions for conversion and formatting of datetimes.

## All packages

Now let's take a look at the function calls across all the packages that import {lubridate}. I'm first going to convert the list of results to a dataframe.

```{r list-to-df}
dep_df <- do.call(rbind, dep_list)
```

### Function use by package

This is a count of the number of uses of each {lubridate} function by each of the the `focus` packages (i.e. the packages we installed).

```{r count-focus-fn-lubridate}
pkg_fn_count <- dep_df |>
  filter(pkg == "lubridate") |>
  count(focus, fun, sort = TRUE)

pkg_fn_count |> slice(1:5)
```

Holy moley, the {PriceIndices} package calls `month()` and `year()`, used to extract elements of a date, over 1400 times combined.

### Unique function use by package

We can also look at things like the packages that make calls to the greatest number of unique {lubridate} functions. Here's the top 5.

```{r count-unique-lubridate-fns}
fn_distinct_count <- dep_df |>
  filter(pkg == "lubridate") |>
  distinct(focus, fun) |>
  count(focus, sort = TRUE) 

fn_distinct_count |> slice(1:5)
```

So these packages are using more than 10 unique functions from {lubridate}, which is pretty extensive usage. It may be tricky to do away with the convenience of the dependnecy in these cases, especially.

Conversely, a quick histogram reveals that a large number of packages are actually using just a single {lubridate} function.

```{r hist-unique-lubridate-fns, fig.alt="Histrogram of unique lubridate functions used by the packages that import lubridate. The vast majority are using 1 or 2, with a long tail out to about 25."}
hist(
  fn_distinct_count$n,
  breaks = 30,
  main = "Unique {lubridate} functions used by\npackages importing {lubridate}",
  xlab = "Function count"
)
```

Maybe the dependency could be dropped in these cases?

Out of interest, which {lubridate} function is the most frequent in packages that use just one?

```{r single-call-pkgs}
focus_one_fn <- fn_distinct_count |>
  filter(n == 1) |>
  pull(focus)

pkg_fn_count |> 
  filter(focus %in% focus_one_fn) |> 
  count(fun, sort = TRUE) |> 
  slice(1:5)
```

Looks like some pretty standard functions, like converting to a date (`as_date()`, `as_datetime()`) or to parse dates with a particular time component (`ymd_hms` for year, month, date, hour, minute, seconds, and `ymd()`).

I think this is interesting: some packages are importing {lubridate} in its entirety to use a single function. And these functions have base R equivalents with no package-dependency cost. Without diving too deep, this implies that people are using {lubridate} because of syntax familiarity or perhaps because they're already loading other tidyverse packages anyway. 

### Non-unique function use by package

What about total calls to {lubridate} functions by each of the dependent package? This is on-unique, so could include one function being called multiple times by a given package.

```{r percent-lubridate}
fn_nondistinct_count <- dep_df |>
  filter(pkg == "lubridate") |>
  count(focus, sort = TRUE)

dep_df |> 
  count(focus) |> 
  left_join(
    fn_nondistinct_count,
    by = "focus",
    suffix = c("_total", "_lub")
  ) |> 
  mutate(percent_lub = round(100 * n_lub / n_total, 1)) |> 
  arrange(desc(percent_lub)) |>
  slice(1:5)
```

Wow, 10% of calls by [the {RClimacell} package](https://nikdata.github.io/RClimacell/) involve {lubridate} functions. Make sense: this package relates to weather readings at certain time intervals.

And another quick histogram of what the distribution looks like.

```{r nonunique-lubridate-count, fig.alt="Histogram of non-unique lubridate functions used by packages that import lubridate. The vast majority make fewer than 50 calls."}
hist(
  fn_nondistinct_count$n,
  breaks = 30,
  main = "Non-unique {lubridate} functions used by\npackages importing {lubridate}",
  xlab = "Function count"
)
```

Huh, so the number of non-unique {lubridate} calls is almost always less than 50 per package. Seems in general that a small number of {lubridate} functions are called per dependent package, but they might be called a lot.

# You do you

Does the information here imply that many developers could consider removing their small number of {lubridate} calls in favour of date-related base functions? Maybe. That's up to the developers.

Ultimately, {itdepends} might be a useful tool for you to work out if you need all the dependencies you have. Other tools are out there; [I read recently](https://ashbaldry.github.io/2021-11-25-depcheck-r-dependency-checker/) about [Ashley Baldry's {depcheck} package](https://github.com/ashbaldry/depcheck), for example

It might be interesting to redo this investigation for all CRAN packages and their dependencies, but I don't have a personal CRAN mirror and I don't write particularly performant code.

Anyway, don't listen to me: I write joke packages that I don't put on CRAN, lol.
