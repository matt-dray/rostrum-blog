<h1>Instructor</h1>
<p>I passed <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/">the requirements</a> to become a <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> trainer, which ‘teach[es] foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide’ as part of <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> initiative.</p>
<p>I wrote about part of this experience in <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/09/12/live-code/">a post about live coding</a> (<a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/09/live-coding-experience/">cross-posted on The Carpentries blog</a>). The ‘code-along’ format is an important part of the teaching approach for The Carpentries.</p>

<h1>Contribution</h1>
<p>One of the instructor assessment requirements is to make a contribution to improve the teaching materials. This can be as simple as raising an issue on GitHub or offering a pull request (PR) to merge in new or amended content.</p>
<p>I made a <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/pull/569">very small PR</a> to correct a small problem with bullet points, but I had <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/issues/570">a more substantial suggestion that I raised in in an issue</a>: to update the entire episode about <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/">{tidyr}</a>, a <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> package used for reshaping data frames.</p>

<div id="pivot" class="section level1">
<h1>Pivot</h1>
<p>Why? Since {tidyr} <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/tidyr-1-0-0/">version 1.0.0</a>, the <code>pivot_longer()</code> and <code>pivot_wider()</code> functions have replaced the <code>spread()</code> and <code>gather()</code> functions.</p>
<p>These functions switch data between a ‘wide’ and ‘long’ forms form. For example, a long data set might have a column called ‘year’ and a column called ‘population’. A wide version would have separate columns named for each year (‘1994’, ‘1995’, etc) that each contained that year’s ‘population’ figures.</p>
<p><code>pivot_wider()</code> can spread the long data into the wide form and <code>pivot_longer()</code> does the opposite. You can learn more in <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html">the {tidyr} vignette about pivoting</a>.</p>
