# tl;dr

You can use R to extract coordinate and elevation data from a GPX file and then plot it as an interactive 3D object. I put some functions in [the tiny R package {gpx3d}](https://github.com/matt-dray/gpx3d) to help do this.

# Elevate to accumulate

I've seen recently on Twitter some people using [Marcus Volz's {strava} R package](https://github.com/marcusvolz/strava/) to create pleasing visualisations of their running routes as small-multiples.

I don't use Strava, but I downloaded my Apple Health data this week and it contained a folder of GPX files; one for each 'workout' activity recorded via my Apple Watch.[^activity] [GPX files are basically just a type of XML](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/GPX) used for storing GPS-related activity.

But rather than try to emulate {strava}, I thought it might be 'fun' to incorporate the elevation data from a GPX as a third dimension. I've also had [mikefc's {ggrgl} package](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/ggrgl)---'a 3D extension to ggplot'---on my to-do list for a while now.

# An alternate dimension

Cut to the chase: I made a tiny package called {gpx3d}. For now it does what I want it to do and it works on my machine.

You can download it from GitHub with help from the {remotes} package.

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/gpx3d")
```

There are a number of dependencies, including many that are not available on CRAN; see [the README for {ggrgl}](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/ggrgl/index.html#installation)
for details. You must also [install XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/), if you havenâ€™t already.[^cmd]

The package does two things and has two exported functions:

* `extract_gpx3d()` gets the data out of a GPX file (i.e. it reads a GPX file; parses the XML; extracts datetime, latitude, longitude and elevation; converts to sf-class; and calculates the distance covered)
* `plot_gpx3d()` plots the data as an interactive 3D object (i.e. it takes the output from `extract_gpx3d()`, generates a '3D ggplot' using {ggrgl} and renders it as an interactive object to an external device)

There are also two demo datasets:

* `segment.gpx`, a GPX file containing a shorter, edited version of the route used in this blogpost, which you can access with `system.file("extdata", "segment.gpx", package = "gpx3d")` after installing the package
* `gpx_segment`, an sf-class data.frame that's the result of using the `extract_gpx3d()` on the built-in `segment.gpx` file

Read on for an explanation and examples.

## Extract

There are already functions that can help read GPX files into R, like `gpx::read_gpx()` and `plotKML::readGPX()`, but I decided to do it by hand with {xml2} to get a custom output format (and to practice handling XML).

In short, the `extract_gpx3d()` function uses `read_xml()` to read the GPX file, then `as_list()` to convert it to a deeply nested list. A little wrangling is then required to create a data.frame: datetime and elevation can be hoisted out of the list okay, but the longitude and latitude are actually extracted from the attributes.

After this, the data.frame is converted to the 'geography-aware' sf-class.[^df] I've done this for two reasons: (1) the output object can be taken away and will play nicely with various {sf} functions, letting you create various maps and perform further processing, and (2) it allowed me to calculate the distance between each recorded point, which could be summed for total distance.

To use `extract_gpx3d()`, simply pass a path to a GPX file. I've chosen a 10 km run I took on Christmas morning,[^location] which I downloaded from Apple Health and stored locally.[^demo]

```{r extract}
file <- "~/Downloads/apple_health_export/workout-routes/route_2021-12-25_9.31am.gpx"
route <- gpx3d::extract_gpx3d(file)
route[2000:2004, ]
```

You can see the rows are basically a measurement per second (`time`) of the coordinates (`lon` and `lat`) and elevation (`ele`), and that the sf-class metadata and `geometry` column are present, along with the `distance` in metres from the previous to current point.

You can take this dataset away and do other stuff with it, like create a lat-long plot of the route (below left), or the elevation over time (below right).

```{r plot-2d, fig.height=3, fig.alt="Two plots: to the left a line showing the route of the run; to the right a line showing the elevation over time. The route is a single loop, roughly rectanglular but with several kinks. The elevation rises before dropping steeply to a plateau, then sharply rising again."}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = rep(0, 4))
with(route, plot(lon, lat, type = "l", axes = FALSE))
with(route, plot(time, ele, type = "l", axes = FALSE))
```

If you're wondering about the little 'tail' in the bottom right of the route, I accidentally joined the back of a Parkrun, so quickly did a hairpin turn to escape. Except the Parkrun route is a 'there-and-back' course, so the confused stewards thought I was now in the lead with a pace of about two minutes per kilometre. Whoops!

The elevation plot is pretty dramatic: roughly, it goes downhill to a small plateau, down again to a flatter plateau, then the inevitable (steep!) climb. The lowest plateau is along the seafront, so basically sea level.

But boo! Only two dimensions? You can instead use the plotting function built in to {gpx3d} for something a bit more exciting.

## Plot

All the hard work of plotting is done primarily by {ggplot2} and {ggrgl}. The former is probably well-known to readers; the latter is an extension [written by mikefc](https://twitter.com/coolbutuseless) to introduce a third dimension to ggplot objects. In other words, you can extrude your plot along some third variable to generate a z-axis.

There's [a whole bunch of specialised 3D geoms](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/ggrgl/index.html#3-dimensional-geometry-types-z-and-3d) in {ggrgl}. For my purposes, I wanted to extend a `geom_path()` line plot into the third dimension. This is achieved by adding a `z` argument to the `aes()` call of the `geom_path_3d()` function, where `z` is our elevation data. 

The function renders the plot as an interactive 3D object with {rgl} to an external `devoutrgl::rgldev()` graphics device. I've managed to embed it in the blog below after [peeking at mikefc's vignettes for {ggrgl}](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/ggrgl/blob/main/vignettes/geom-path-3d.Rmd), though it may take a moment to load and there's no guarantees it will work on mobile.

```{r plot, eval=FALSE}
gpx3d::plot_gpx3d(route_sf)
```

[Mouseclick and drag the object below, or zoom with your scrollwheel][^lick]

```{r plot-hidden, echo=FALSE}
min_date   <- format(min(route$time), "%Y-%m-%d")
min_time   <- format(min(route$time), "%H:%M:%S")
max_time   <- format(max(route$time), "%H:%M:%S")
total_dist <- round(sum(route$distance, na.rm = TRUE) / 1000, 1)
min_elev   <- min(route$ele)
max_elev   <- max(route$ele)
elev_diff  <- round(max_elev - min_elev)

route_plot <-
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::labs(
    title = paste(
      total_dist, "km route with elevation disparity of", elev_diff, "m"
    ),
    subtitle = paste(min_date, "from", min_time, "to", max_time),
    caption = "Made with {ggplot2}, {ggrgl}, {sf}, {xml2}"
  ) +
  ggplot2::xlab("Longitude") +
  ggplot2::ylab("Latitude") +
  ggrgl::geom_path_3d(
    ggplot2::aes(route$lon, route$lat, z = route$ele),
    extrude = TRUE,
    extrude_edge_colour = 'grey20',
    extrude_face_fill = 'grey80',
    extrude_edge_alpha = 0.2
  )

devoutrgl::rgldev(fov = 30, view_angle = -30)
route_plot
invisible(grDevices::dev.off())
```

```{r rglwidget, echo=FALSE}
if (!interactive()) rgl::rglwidget()
```

Again, you can see why I chose this particular route for this demo; it really shows off the power of the elevation data. I ran anti-clockwise downhill to the seafront, where it was almost entirely flat, before running back up a relatively sharp ascent.

If you think there's too much 'junk' in the plot, you can also set the argument `route_only` to `TRUE` to get rid of all the chart elements and leave behind the path only.

```{r plot2, eval=FALSE}
gpx3d::plot_gpx3d(route, route_only = TRUE)
```

This time I've inserted a gif of what the output would look like:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-12-30-gpx3d_files/gpx3d-demo.gif" alt="Gif showing an RGL device with a 3D interactive object representing a workout route. The z dimension is elevation and the route rises from low to high elevation. The object is spun and zoomed into to highglight the elevation change." width="100%"/>
</div>

Wish I'd got a 3D printer for Christmas now.

# A romance of many dimensions

I've made {gpx3d} entirely for my own amusement, so your kilometreage may vary. At this point I can't make any guarantees about whether it will even work on your machine, but hopefully I'll find time in future to make sure it does. It might also be nice to include more user options for adjusting the output so you aren't stuck with 'ggplot grey' and the same defaults mikefc used in a vignette showing a {ggrgl} [version of Minard's famous visulisation of Napoleon's march](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/ggrgl/articles/geom-path-3d.html).[^rayshader]

I'll also be thinking about developing {gpx4d} and functions like `geom_tesseract()`, but I might need physics to catch up first.

[^activity]: [I wrote earlier in the year about wrangling my Nike Run Club data via Apple Health](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/03/23/xml-health/). It seems as though NRC doesn't pass geographic information to Health, but now I also record my runs via the Workout app on the watch, which does regurgitate the geo-related data.
[^rayshader]: I also realised later that [Tyler Morgan-Wall already did something like this with {rayshader}](https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall/status/1024996007094968320?s=20). I should have guessed.
[^df]: Or you can return a simpler data.frame without the sf-class by passing `sf_out = FALSE` to `extract_gpx3d()`.
[^demo]: You could try using the demo GPX file that's included in the package, using `file <- system.file("extdata", "segment.gpx", package = "gpx3d")`
[^lick]: I originally wrote 'mouselick' instead of 'mouseclick'.
[^location]: In a place I do not live, so minimal opsec-leaking here.
[^cmd]: At time of writing, I can't get the R CMD check to pass for the {gpx3d} GitHub repo because {ggrgl} appears to require XQuartz to be installed; this is a problem when running continuous integration on a remote server. You'll know if I've managed to sort this out when the README badge changes from 'failing' to 'passing'.
