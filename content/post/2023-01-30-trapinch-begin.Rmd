# tl;dr

I've begun the [{trapinch}](https://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch) R package to wrap the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), underpinned by [{httr2}](https://httr2.r-lib.org/).

# {httr} me baby one more time

[The {httr2} package](https://httr2.r-lib.org/) is a friendly, modular rewrite of [{httr}](https://httr.r-lib.org/) for dealing with HTTP requests and responses ('talking to the internet').

By 'friendly' I mean that the functions are abstracted and consistently prefixed. By 'modular' I mean the functions are relatively small and pipeable so they can be built up to generate requests and handle responses.

I've made use of {httr} to [expore package startup messages](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/08/27/zzz/) and [to detect linkrot on webpages](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/07/10/linkrot/), so now it's time to try {httr2}. What would be a rostrum.blog-appropriate API to work with? 

# PokéAPI

Yup.

You can query the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) API for all sorts of information related to the Pokémon series of games. 

It's a relatively simple API and good to practice with. It doesn't require sign-up nor API tokens. URLs used for getting data are simple too: you append an endpoint and a resource of interest to the base URL in the form `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/{endpoint}/{resource}`.[^exception]

In other words, you could type https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/lotad/ in your browser and the API would respond with information about [Lotad, the best Pokémon](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/2/2c/Lotad_PMRS.png).

But {httr2} will let us do this programmatically.

# Features

There's a lot to improve in {trapinch}, but I'm sharing it in case I don't take it any further, or in case you want to contribute [an issue](https://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch/issues) or pull request. 

The package requires R version 4.1 or higher (because it uses `R_user_dir` and the base pipe, `|>`, internally) and can be downloaded from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/trapinch")  # v0.1 here
```

And then we can attach it as usual:

```{r library}
library(trapinch)
```

## Main functions

There's a generic low-level function, `get_pokeapi()`, to which you pass the `endpoint` and `resource` ID (numeric) or name (character) of interest. Each endpoint also has its own dedicated function, like `get_item()` or `get_move()`, which ultimately calls `get_pokeapi()` under the hood.

You can look at `resource_lookups` to get a dataframe of resource IDs and names for each endpoint. Here's the first few:

```{r endpoints}
head(names(resource_lookups))
```

And here's the first few rows of the resource dataframe for the 'pokemon' endpoint:

```{r pokemon-resources}
head(resource_lookups[["pokemon"]])
```

One of these resource names is 'mew', the legendary first-generation Pokémon. You could use `get_pokeapi("pokemon", "mew")` to retrieve its data, or more simply:

```{r get-mew}
mew <- get_pokemon("mew")
```

The function outputs a list of lists, which is parsed from the JSON response provided by the API. So for the 'pokemon' endpoint we get 18 different elements of various classes:

```{r mew-names}
str(mew, max.level = 1)
```
I've shown only the top level `str`ucture to hide some of the complexity. For example, the 'moves' item contains all the moves a Pokémon can learn, at what level it can learn them, in which game it learns them, and so on. So grabbing the first of the `r length(mew[["moves"]])` moves listed for Mew looks like this (oof):

```{r mew-pound}
mew[["moves"]][[1]][["move"]][["name"]]
```

A future task might be to simplify some of this complexity by collapsing deep lists into dataframes where possible.

## Auto-paging

The API responses are 'paged', meaning that you must make successive requests of a set size to retrieve all the data for a given endpoint. The `get_*()` functions automatically expand the request to ask for all the items in one go. 

We know the maximum number of items to be returned from an endpoint because the stored in the `resource_lookups` object, so this can be appended automatically to the request string. 

## Caching

Responses are cached, which means that the data is saved on your computer. If you make the same request, the data will be retrieved first from the cache rather than calling the API again. That means there's one less request for the API to deal with. 

The cache is the path resolved by `R_user_dir("trapinch", "cache")`, a function that was introduced in R v4.0 for platform-independent storage of package-related data on a user's machine.[^ruserdir] You can delete everything from the cache with `clear_cache()`.

# {httr2}

The user-facing functions of {trapinch} are therefore pretty simple. How daunting does the code look in the back-end? Turns out that it's not that scary, thanks to those friendly and modular functions of {httr2}.

So let's walk through what's happening in that earlier `get_pokemon("mew")` call.

We can use the {httr2} functions to build up an API call by:

1. Starting with the base URL
2. Appending the endpoint and resource as extensions (in the form `/pokemon/mew`)
3. Adding a query for the maximum number of items in this endpoint-resource combo (in the form `?limit=1279`)
4. Announcing to the API, as courtesy, who has made the call
5. Specifying the cache location for results to be saved

First some variables:

```{r vars}
endpoint <- "pokemon"
resource <- "mew"
base_url <- "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/"
user_agent <- "trapinch (http://github.com/matt-dray/trapinch)"
resource_count <- nrow(trapinch::resource_lookups[[endpoint]])
cache_dir <- tools::R_user_dir("trapinch", which = "cache")
```

And now we can build our request with {httr2} functions prefixed with `req`:

```{r request}
library(httr2)

mew_request <- request(base_url) |>
  req_url_path_append(endpoint, resource) |>
  req_url_query(limit = resource_count) |>
  req_user_agent(user_agent) |>
  req_cache(cache_dir)
```

Printing the object summarises the request:

```{r}
mew_request
```

Then we can actually execute the request:

```{r perform}
mew_perform <- req_perform(mew_request)
mew_perform
```

We can see the request was successful, since the HTTP status was `200 OK`. Other [status values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) are possible and may require us to try again later, for example.

Finally we can parse the JSON returned by the API. Again, I'm presenting the top-level `str`ucture only, given its complexity:

```{r response}
mew_response <- resp_body_json(mew_perform)
str(mew_response, max.level = 1)
```

And so yes, this is indeed the same information we retrieved earlier with `get_pokemon("mew")`.

# Testing testing

[{httptest2}](https://enpiar.com/httptest2/) is a neat package that lets you test code written with {httr2}, specifically.

Why would you need special testing for API calls? The idea is that you should be able to test your package without the need for an active internet connection. {httptest2} 'records' the calls you make when you run your tests, then chooses when testing between this 'mock' response and a 'live' response.

The approach is pretty simple if you've tested with {testthat} before: you wrap your normal `test_that()` call with `httr2::with_mock_dir()`. Here's an example of a test that make sure we get a list back from the API when we use `get_pokeapi()`:


```{r httptest2, eval=FALSE}
with_mock_dir("endpoint", {
  test_that("a list is returned", {
    expect_type(get_pokeapi("move-battle-style"), "list")
  })
})
```

By wrapping the test in `with_mock_dir()`, {httptest2} creates the directory `tests/endpoint/` that stores a copy of the JSON returned for this call when an internet connection was live. 

As an aside, I learnt about `curl::has_internet()` in [Colin's blogpost](https://colinfay.me/build-api-wrapper-package-r/), which can `stop()` the `get_*()` functions if there's no internet connection. But `has_internet()` will trigger if you're offline when you test, defeating the purpose of {httptest2}! Luckily, I saw [a timely post by Maëlle](https://blog.r-hub.io/2023/01/23/code-switch-escape-hatch-test/) about integrating this type of check into an 'escape hatch' so your unit tests can be run successfully offline.

# What's in a name?

Why 'trapinch'? In short, ['trapinch' is the name of a Pokémon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Trapinch_(Pok%C3%A9mon)) that contains the letters 'R API', which is cute. It also makes for an easy hex sticker with the Pokémon's characteristic zigzag mouth and colour palette of orange and grey.

So why not 'rapidash', which starts with 'R API'? Easy, lol: 'trapinch' isn't taken yet on [Repokémon](https://cheeaun.github.io/repokemon/), a page by [Chee Aun](https://github.com/cheeaun) that lists GitHub repositories that are named after Pokémon.[^dialga]

[^exception]: There's one exception: for Pokémon encounters you need the form `/pokemon/{resource}/encounters`.
[^dialga]: I have history with this: [my {dialga} package](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/04/10/dialga/) is named for [the legendary 'temporal' Pokémon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dialga_(Pok%C3%A9mon)) from the _Diamond_ and _Pearl_ games, which is fitting because the package converts between R code, [cron strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) and English.
[^ruserdir]: I made a mockery of `R_user_dir`'s functionality in [my toy package {tamRgo}](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/11/13/tamrgo/), which uses the location to store data for a persistent cyberpet ('Tamagotchi') that you can interact with in the R console.
