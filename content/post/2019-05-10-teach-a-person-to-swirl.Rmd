# tl;dr

Teach people to create tools that teach other people. That seems an efficient way to maximise impact.

* [{swirl}](https://swirlstats.com/) lets people learn R from within R
* [{swirlify}](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/) is a package to help write Swirl courses
* This post explains how to start a Swirl course
* For example, I've begun [Tidyswirl](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl) for teaching [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages

# Swirl

[Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) is a platform that:

>teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console!

Learning is active and understanding is checked throughout. Learners can move at their own pace and download additional courses to learn about new things. And it's free.

To begin, install and load Swirl then follow the instructions printed in the console.

```{r, install-swirl, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
swirl()
```

You can learn about new things by downloading various community-contributed Swirl courses. This post is about how you can quickly create and distribute a new course yourself.

# Swirlify

Sean Kross and Nick Carchedi have created [the {swirlify} package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=swirlify) to make course creation easy. This post covers a simple workflow to get you started, but [full Swirlify guidance](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/) is available. 

Create a new lesson ('Lesson 1'), which also creates a new course ('Course') if it doesn't exist. 

```{r, new-lesson, eval=FALSE}
library(swirl)  # install.packages("swirl")
library(swirlify)  # install.packages("swirlify")
new_lesson(course_name = "Course", lesson_name = "Lesson 1")
```

The following folder structure is generated:

```
Working directory/
└── Course/
    └── Lesson_1/
        ├── customTests.R
        ├── dependson.txt
        ├── initLesson.R
        └── lesson.yaml
```

The `lesson.yaml` file is basically a text file where the question script is stored in a particular format. You can modify this file directly, but let's open it for editing in the built-in Swirlify Shiny app instead:

```{r, swirlify, eval=FALSE}
swirlify()
```

The app will open the current working lesson -- Lesson 1 -- in a new window. On the left is where you create new questions. On the right you can see the lesson file itself. Note the 'Help' tab, which tells you about the types of questions you can make.

![The Swirlify Shiny app provides a GUI for writing lessons](/post/2019-05-10-teach-a-person-to-swirl_files/swirl-shiny.png)

To build a question:

1. Choose a question type from the dropdown menu (e.g. command questions, multiple choice, or just informational messages)
1. Fill in the text boxes
1. Click 'Save Lesson'
1. Run `test_lesson()` to look for errors
1. Click 'Demo Lesson' to try it out

You can add objects, like data frames, to the learner's environment when they start your course. Do this by adding R code to `initLesson.R`. This can include loading data files, which you should store within the lesson folder. 

Continue adding questions until the lesson is complete. Then:

1. Run `add_to_manifest()` to add the lesson to the `MANIFEST` file (it'll be created in the course directory if it doesn't already exist). Lessons in here are recognised as part of the course in the declared order.
1. Use `new_lesson()` to create a new one, remembering to change the `lesson_name` argument.

Clearly the process of course building is more nuanced than outlined here, but you can learn more from the documentation on the [Swirlify](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/index.html) site and [reference manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/swirlify/swirlify.pdf).

Congratulations. You're ready to share your course.

## Share

There are [several ways to share your course](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/sharing.html). It's easiest for learners to use Swirl's `swirl::install_course_*()` functions to install courses from:

* a GitHub repo
* a zip file stored on DropBox, Google Drive, or some URL
* a course folder -- zipped or not -- downloaded locally on their machine

You can also compress your course to a single `.swc` file with `compress_course()` and raise a pull request for it to be hosted on the [Swirl Course Network](http://swirlstats.com/scn/). It can be downloaded from there with `install_course()`.

Swirl is strengthened by having a greater number and range of courses.

# Tidyswirl

I've started [a Swirl course called Tidyswirl](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl). The goal is to introduce each core package of [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). It currently has draft lessons for [{tidyr}](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) and [{tibble}](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).

Tidyswirl is currently on GitHub. To install:

```{r, install-tidyswirl, eval=FALSE}
install_course_github("matt-dray", "tidyswirl")
```

Please feel free to [contribute new lessons or raise issues](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Or begin your own course.
