# tl;dr

I wrote [an R Shiny app that tells you how many players at World Cup 2018 were younger than you](https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/wc18-age/){target='_blank'}. It's designed to make you feel old. You're welcome.

Here's some solid reviews I've received so far:

>Very depressing

>I knew I was too old to become a great footballer

>Just what I needed to see

Thanks folks!

# I was at the World Cup Final

<p class="caption">Extremely rare and valuable tickets for the (CONIFA) World Cup final</p>
</div>

So the World Cup is over for another year.

I managed to get tickets for the final, where [Karpatlya](http://www.conifa.org/en/members/karpatalya/){target='_blank'} -- a Hungarian diaspora in Ukraine -- overcame the powerful [Northern Cyprus](http://www.conifa.org/en/members/northern-cyprus/){target='_blank'} team on penalties at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Enfield, London.

Another successful tournament from the [Confederation of Independent Football Associations](http://www.conifa.org/en/about-us/){target='_blank'} (CONIFA).

# It didn't come home

Oh and also the far-less popular [FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup){target='_blank'} has finished.

Wonderkid [Kylian Mbapp&eacute;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9){target='_blank'} picked up the young player of the tournament as France lifted the trophy for the second time in their history.

Yes, 19-year-old Mbapp&eacute; is young enough to have been born after France's last World Cup win in 1998.

# Could I still be an international superstar?

It seems only yesterday that I was dreaming of starting alongside hall-of-famer Bermudan [Shaun Goater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Goater){target='_blank'} in the Manchester City starting XI at the turn of the millennium. (That reference probably dates me quite well.)

Obviously I can still make it as an elite footballer. Right? 

What better way to find out than to build an app with R Shiny?

# The app

You can [access the app in full on its very own page](https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/wc18-age/){target='_blank'}, but I've also embedded it below. Simply input your birthdate and then recoil in horror.

<iframe src="https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/wc18-age/" width="100%" height="1400" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The app asks merely for your birth date -- selectable from the dropdown menu -- and calculates the number and percentage of players younger than you, with an interactive table that lists who they are.

A colleague suggested that wasn't enough punishment. So I updated it to tell you how many of the players you could be parent to, assuming you had them when you were age 18.

Enjoy! And take inspiration from [Kazuyoshi 'King Kazu' Miura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuyoshi_Miura){target='_blank'}, a Japanese 51-year-old (born 1967) who is still playing at time of writing. He's apparently just [played a match for Yokohama FC alongside 16-year-old Koki Saito](https://twitter.com/yokhin/status/1020981764276260864?s=21){target='_blank'} (born 2001), who in theory is young enough to be his grandson!

# Some technicals

The code is available in the [matt-dray/wc18-age](https://github.com/matt-dray/wc18-age){target='_blank'} repo. The app is hosted on the [shinyapps.io free plan](https://www.shinyapps.io/){target='_blank'} and will stop working when more than 25 hours of use are recorded. Or I might just remove it one day with no explanation.

I used the data set in the [AllezCannes/WorldCupSquads](https://github.com/AllezCannes/WorldCupSquads){target='_blank'} GitHub repo, which contains player data scraped from Wikipedia by user [philstraforelli](https://github.com/philstraforelli){target='_blank'}.
