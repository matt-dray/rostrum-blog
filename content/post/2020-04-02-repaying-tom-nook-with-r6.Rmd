## tl;dr

How would [capitalist raccoon-dog Tom Nook](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Nook){target='_blank'} simulate home-loan payments using R?[^ages]

I built a version of [Animal Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing){target='_blank'}'s [Automatic Bell Dispenser](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Bells){target='_blank'} (a kind of ATM/cashpoint) using [Winston Chang](https://twitter.com/winston_chang){target='_blank'}'s [{R6} package](https://r6.r-lib.org/){target='_blank'}, inspired by an exercise from [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/){target='_blank'}'s [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html){target='_blank'} book.

# What do those words mean?

## Animal Crossing

[Animal Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing){target='_blank'} is a wholesome Nintendo videogame franchise in which you arrive on an island and befriend [anthropomorphic animal villagers](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Villager_list_(New_Horizons){target='_blank'}). You can catch insects and fish, design clothes, fill a museum with fossils, develop the infrastructure of the island and interact with other players. It's pretty chill.[^isolation] The latest version, New Horizons, was recently released.[^nh]

## Tom Nook

[Tom Nook](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Tom_Nook){target='_blank'} is a [tanuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog){target='_blank'}. Depending on who you ask, he's either a maniacal [rip-off merchant](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7jyjd/tom-nook-ripping-you-off-animal-crossing-new-horizons-bells-to-usd){target='_blank'}, or [a misunderstood chap](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21184928/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-interview-tom-nook){target='_blank'} who gives you several interest-free home loans with no obligation.

## Automatic Bell Dispenser

The in-game currency is [Bells](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Bells){target='_blank'}, which can be gained by selling things, helping residents or occasionally hitting a rock with a spade. You use an [Automatic Bell Dispenser](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Automatic_Bell_Dispenser){target='_blank'} (ABD, like an ATM) to deposit, withdraw and make loan payments.

## R6

R is primarily a function-focused language. Mostly you write functions that output objects.

But there's also Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP brings together values (fields) and functions (methods) into classes. You can interact with a class via its methods, which may trigger further internal methods and update the values. You can also create subclasses that add to or amend the logic of its parent. 

You may have heard of the object-oriented systems S3 and S4 in R; R6 provides another, newer implementation of OOP. There are two important things to know about R6 objects. To simplify, they're:

* 'encapsulated', meaning that methods are applied to objects, like `object$some_method()`
* 'mutable', meaning that fields are updated as you apply the methods

I'm not going into depth about OOP and R6 here. For more, I recommend:

* the [{R6} introduction vignette](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html){target='_blank'} by [Winston Chang](https://twitter.com/winston_chang){target='_blank'}
* a chapter in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html){target='_blank'} by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/){target='_blank'}[^ad-r-solutions]
* the article '[How to explain OOP concepts to a 6-year-old](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/){target='_blank'}' by Alexander Petkov of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/){target='_blank'}

A really intriguing and illustrative use-case of R6 is [Giora Simonchi](http://giorasimchoni.com/){target='_blank'}'s [Castle of R](http://giorasimchoni.com/2017/09/10/2017-09-10-you-re-in-a-room-the-castleofr-package/){target='_blank'}, which is a text adventure game for R(!). Here, classes are things like 'room' and 'door' that have specific properties and actions you can take on them. The properties are modified as you play, given your location, items you're carrying, etc.

# Demo {#demo}

The R6 chapter of the Advanced R book has [an exercise](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html#exercises-44){target='_blank'} about building a bank account class.

Inspired by this, I've built a class that mimics the functionality of an Automatic Bell Dispenser with some particular fields (`savings` and `loan` values) and methods (`deposit`, `withdraw` and `loan_payment` functions).[^optimised]

## Use the class

I'll explain below how to:

* start a new instance of the class
* use the `deposit()` method to increase the value of the `savings` field
* use the `withdraw()` method to decrease the `savings` field
* use the `pay_loan()` method to decrease the value of the `loan` field

### Initialise

You can start, or 'initialise', an instance of the class by calling `new()` on the class name and assigning it. I've called my object `account`.

```{r initialise}
account <- AutomaticBellDispenser$new()
```

Initialising the class also triggers the printing of the current account details and instructions. This mimics the interface you see on the Automatic Bell Dispenser in-game.

In this case, you can see that we have zero savings, but a multi-million loan to pay off. This value represents the final loan amount that Nook sets you in the game.[^fish-price]

### Make a deposit

Now we can make a deposit to our account. Use `$` notation to say 'to the `account` object apply the `deposit` method'. In this case, the value supplied to `deposit` is the amount of Bells. 

```{r deposit}
account$deposit(1000)
account  # check status of account
```

You could also access the updated `savings` field directly from the `account` object:

```{r savings}
account$savings
```

So we now have savings of 1000 Bells! Of course, I just made up that value. I could add as much as I want. Use your imagination.

In game, you can sell items and receive gifts to get money in your pocket, which you can then add to your savings. I haven't created the concept of 'pockets' in this demo, but you could create a `pocket` class. You could also create a `fish` class with subclasses for each species, including the trade value.

### Withdraw and pay loan

We can also withdraw money and make loan payments. You can chain method calls together with `$` between them, so we could withdraw 200 Bells and make a loan payment of 300 Bells at once.

```{r withdraw-loan}
account$withdraw(200)$loan_payment(300)
account
```

So the loan amount was reduced by 300 Bells, but our savings reduced by 500 Bells (200 + 300 Bells).

Important point: notice how we didn't have to overwrite the `account` object to update the values? Remember that this is because the class is _mutable_.

As in the game, you can also choose to transfer everything in your savings by providing `full_amount = TRUE` rather than a value amount.

```{r full-amount}
account$loan_payment(full_amount = TRUE)
account
```

So the loan balance has gone down by a further 500 bells, which was the remainder of our savings.

### Messages

There are some limits to the Automatic Bell Dispenser system, like there's no overdraft and the outstanding loan amount can't be negative. I built a few warnings and errors into the class to handle these situation. For example:

* warning -- you can only pay in whole Bells (decimal amounts are rounded down to the nearest whole number)
* warning -- you can't remove more savings than you have (defaults to removing the maximum amount you have in savings)
* warning -- you can't pay off more than the total loan amount (defaults to paying total remaining loan)
* error -- once you pay off your loan, you can't make more payments!

You'll also get a celebratory message when the loan reaches zero.

So, for example, here's what happens if you try to pay off the loan with more savings than you have and if you also try to pay in decimal Bells:

```{r warnings}
account$deposit(1000)$loan_payment(1001.10)
```

We got two warnings:

1. The decimal value was rounded down to the nearest integer
1. We tried to pay off 1001 Bells, but only had a total of 1000 Bells

The result is that our savings are empty and the loan is 1000 Bells lighter.

```{r}
account$savings
account$loan
```

## Build the class

I wanted to point out a few elements of the code that went into building the class. You can refer back to the full code in [the expandable section above](#demo).

First, the basic structure is a call to `R6::R6Class()`, which contains the name of the class and a list of values and fields.

```{r r6-structure, eval=FALSE}
AutomaticBellDispenser <- R6Class(  # call the function, assign a name
  "AutomaticBellDispenser",  # class name
  list(
    # truncated (fields and methods go here)
  )
)
```

There are two fields in this class, which are put inside the `list()` with some starting values:

```{r r6-fields, eval=FALSE}
#...
  # set initial values for fields
  savings = 0,     # start from zero
  loan = 2498000,  # loan size
#...
```

There's an `initialize()` method that I've used to print the Automatic Bell Dispenser display when a new instance of the class is started. It reformats values and uses emoji for the lols.

```{r r6-initialize, eval=FALSE}
#...
  # show on startup the account status and options
  initialize = function(...) {
    loan_formatted <- format(  # reformat the loan field value
      self$loan,          # the 'loan' field from this class (i.e. 'itself')
      big.mark = ",",     # format as '1,000' rather than '1000'
      scientific = FALSE  # prevent 12000000 being displayed as '1.2e+07'
    )
    savings_formatted <- format(
      self$savings, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE
    )
    cat("Automatic Bell Dispenser (ABD)\n\n")  # cat() prints to console
    cat(emo::ji("bell"), "Loan Balance:", loan_formatted, "Bells\n")
    cat(emo::ji("pig2"), "Savings Balance:", savings_formatted, "Bells\n\n")
    cat(
      "Please make a selection from the menu below\n\n",
      emo::ji("house"), "loan_payment()\n",
      emo::ji("arrow_up"), "deposit()\n",
      emo::ji("arrow_down"), "withdraw()"
    )
  },
#...
```

The same code is used in the `print()` method too, which means that these details will be printed whenever you call your object.

The methods for `deposit()`, `withdraw()` and `loan_payment()` look similar, but have slightly different behaviour. The simplest is `deposit()`, which makes the input an integer and warns the user if a decimal value has been used, then adds the amount to the `savings` field.

```{r r6-deposit, eval=FALSE}
#...
  deposit = function(amount = 0) {    # function takes an amount to deposit
    amount_int <- as.integer(amount)  # round to nearest lowest integer
    if (amount - amount_int > 0) {    # warning if rounding has occurred
      warning(
        "Deposit rounded to ", amount_int, " Bells.\n",
        call. = FALSE # prevents printing of the error-causing line
      )
    } else {
      self$savings <- self$savings + amount_int  # add amount to savings
    }
    invisible(self)  # return but don't print
  }
#...
```

Note how the field values are accessed with `self$field_name`. We also return `self` at the end, but it's wrapped in `invisible()` so it updates the field without printing.

# What now, squirt?

So now you know how I've been spending my time during this period of enforced isolation: playing Animal Crossing, messing about with R or, most importantly, messing around with Animal Crossing in R.

While this use of {R6} has been totally frivolous, it's helped me understand OOP a bit better and get more of an insight into how R works.

I recommend you take a look at the Advanced R book, which is [online for free](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) or can be [purchased](https://www.crcpress.com/Advanced-R-Second-Edition/Wickham/p/book/9780815384571),[^sponsor] for a better understanding of OOP and its implementations in R.

I also recommend getting hold of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Just be wary of that racoon guy...
