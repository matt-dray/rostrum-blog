# Smash!

[Super Smash Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros.) (SSB) is a beat 'em up videogame series featuring characters from various Nintendo franchises and beyond. 

The series has featured on Nintendo 64 ([Super Smash Bros, 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._(video_game))), Gamecube ([SSB Melee, 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee)), Wii ([SSB Brawl, 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl)), Wii U and 3DS ([SSB '4', 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._for_Nintendo_3DS_and_Wii_U)) and an upcoming title for the Switch console.

The game is popular enough to have resulted in [a series of organised tournaments](https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_largest_Smash_tournaments)[^1].

You can fight characters directly but you can also make use of items and weapons from games across the Nintendo universe, such as the mushroom ([the Super Mario series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario)), the heart container ([Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda)) and the home run bat ([EarthBound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound)).

One of the more interesting items in SSB is the pokeball. This item is used in [the Pokemon series of games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)) to capture and store Pokemon. When a player picks up and throws a pokeball in SSB, it opens to release 1 of a possible 13 Pokemon. [The SSB wiki](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Pok%C3%A9_Ball) says that all of them are 'common', except for 'uncommon' Snorlax and 'rare' Mew (apparently only once every 151 releases, which is related to the number of Pokemon in the original game).

So how frequently in practice does each Pokemon emerge from a pokeball in SSB on N64?

This is a short post to sate my curiosity. I've used R code throughout. The post will update as I gather more data.

# Data

I'm a recovering ecologist, so data collection by observation is very important to me. I watched four computer-controlled players face-off in versus mode (it's a weekend and I'm old enough to do whatever I want (after I've done my chores)). Pokeballs were the only items set to 'on' and frequency was set to 'very high'. I saved the file as [a CSV on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/draytasets/blob/master/ssb_pokeballs.csv).

```{r read}
library(dplyr)  # data manipulation
library(readr)  # reading files

balls <- readr::read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/draytasets/master/ssb_pokeballs.csv"
) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(pokemon = tools::toTitleCase(pokemon))

dplyr::pull(balls)[1:25]  # be careful when pulling balls
```

# Frequency

## Table

We can make use of the `tabyl()` function from the `janitor` package.

```{r}
balls_summary <- balls %>%
  janitor::tabyl(pokemon) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(percent = percent * 100) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(Pokemon = pokemon, Count = n, Percent = percent)
  
knitr::kable(balls_summary)
```

## Plot

Of course we can plot these data a well. It seems fitting to have a Pokemon theme, so we can use the `gghealth()` function from [the `Rokemon` package](https://github.com/schochastics/Rokemon) by [David Schoch](http://schochastics.net/). This creates a bar chart where the bars look like the health point (HP) meter from the original Pokemon games on the Nintendo Game Boy.[^2]

```{r plot}
library(ggplot2)  # plots
library(Rokemon)  # poke-themed package

balls %>% 
  group_by(pokemon) %>% 
  dplyr::count() %>% 
  Rokemon::gghealth("pokemon", "n") +
  labs(
    x = "", y = "Count",
    title = "Pokeball release frequencies",
    subtitle = "Super Smash Bros on Nintendo 64"
  )
```

# Revelation

So it looks like the 'common' Pokemon according to [the SSB wiki](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Pok%C3%A9_Ball) are indeed more common, though Snorlax appears equal second on this list, despite being labelled as 'uncommon'. Clefairy also appeared less than expected, given it was labelled as 'common'.

Mew appeared `r balls_summary[balls_summary$Pokemon == "Mew", "Count"]` times out of `r nrow(balls)`, which is once every `r round((nrow(balls)/balls_summary[balls_summary$Pokemon == "Mew", "Count"]), 1)` releases.

Bear in mind that this is only based on a sample of `r nrow(balls)` so far . I'll keep collecting data to update this post.
