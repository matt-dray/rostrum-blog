# tl;dr

I spoke at the latest Bioinformatics London Meetup ([event link](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/efficient-rstats-workflows-with-the-drake-and-orderly-packages-tickets-88917343167#){target='_blank'}, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bioinfoLDN){target='_blank'}) about workflow reproducibility tools in R. I explained the benefits of [Will Landau](https://wlandau.github.io/){target='_blank'}'s [{drake}](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/){target='_blank'} package for doing this.

# Order, order

[Rich FitzJohn](https://richfitz.github.io/){target='_blank'} opened proceedings with an excellent introduction to his [{orderly} package](https://vimc.github.io/orderly/){target='_blank'} ([source](https://github.com/vimc/orderly){target='_blank'}) that is intended for 'lightweight reproducible reporting'.

In short, the user declares inputs (anything, including things like SQL queries and CSV files) and artefacts (results) of their analysis. {orderly} loads what is declared, evaluates and runs what is necessary, and verifies that the declared artefacts are made. A bunch of metadata is stored alongside the analysis that can be used later to determine the source of any dependency changes.

I followed up with the basics of {drake}. My slides are in the following section.

We were also lucky to have a celebrity guest on the line: the creator of {drake}, [Will Landau](https://wlandau.github.io/){target='_blank'}, who said some words about the package's development and took questions. Will was also able to extend gratitude to Rich for having developed [{remake}](https://github.com/richfitz/remake){target='_blank'}, a workflow manager for R that was a precursor to the development of {drake}.

# Slides

You can [open the slides in a dedicated tab](https://matt-dray.github.io/drake-bioinformatics/#1){target='_blank'} (press P for presenter notes)  or [see the source](https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-bioinformatics){target='_blank'}. The slides introduce the idea of a workflow manager to improve reproducibility and how {drake} can fill that gap.

The second half of the presentation contains a small and simple demonstration of {drake} in action using R's excellent built-in [beaver-temperature datasets](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/beavers.html).

Bonus reproducibility: the {drake} analysis takes place in the slides themselves and is recreated from scratch when they're regenerated. This is made possible by [{xaringan}](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1){target='_blank'}, [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/)'s package for reproducible presentations.

I also created a single file containing [the code that was run in the slides](https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-bioinformatics/blob/master/drake-beavers-workflow.R){target='_blank'}.

# Packages ----------------------------------------------------------------

# All available from CRAN with install.packages()
library(drake)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rphylopic)  # get CC0 organism graphics

# Functions ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Simple beaver plot
b_plot <- function(data, image) {
  ggplot(data, aes(id, temp)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(title = "Beaver temperature") +
    add_phylopic(image)
}

# Simple beaver summary table
b_table <- function(data) {
  beavers_trim <- data %>% 
    group_by(id) %>% 
    summarise(
      mean = mean(temp), sd = sd(temp),
      min = min(temp, max = max(temp))
      ) %>% ungroup()
  return(beavers_trim)
}

# Plan --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Wrap analysis steps in drake_plan()

plan <- drake_plan(
  
  # 1. Wrangle data
  
  b1 = mutate(beaver1, id = "A"),  # built-in dataset
  b2 = mutate(beaver2, id = "B"),  # built-in dataset
  beavers = bind_rows(b1, b2),
  
  # 1. Get phylopic image
  
  uid = "be8670c2-a5bd-4b44-88e8-92f8b0c7f4c6",
  png = image_data(uid, size = "512")[[1]],
  
  # 3. Generate outputs
  # The .Rmd is avaiable from github.com/matt-dray/drake-bioinformatics
  
  plot = b_plot(beavers, png),
  table = b_table(beavers),
  report = rmarkdown::render(
    knitr_in("beavers-report.Rmd"),  # note knitr_in()
    output_file = file_out("beaver-report.html"),  # note file_out()
    quiet = TRUE
  )
  
)

# Make --------------------------------------------------------------------

drake::make(plan)  # executes the analysis steps in the plan

# Inspection --------------------------------------------------------------

# Get cached objects
cached()  # check what's in the cache
readd()  # return an object from the cache

# Create network graph
config <- drake_config(plan)  # make a configuration file for the plan
vis_drake_graph(config)  # build an interactive network graph using the config

# Make changes ------------------------------------------------------------

# Let's say something in your workflow changed. What is now out of date?

outdated()  # prints the targets that are out of date

vis_drake_graph(config)  # rebuild grpah to see impacted targets coloured black

drake::make(plan)  # re-make the plan!
```

I don't shut up about reproducibility in R. That's why I've coined the word 'reproducevangelism'. Here's a couple of related posts:
