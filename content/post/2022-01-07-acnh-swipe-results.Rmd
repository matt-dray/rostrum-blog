# tl;dr

I wrote [an R Shiny app](https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/acnh-swipe/) to run a popularity contest for Animal Crossing villagers. Surprise: cute ones are favourites.

# Swiping {shinyswipe} code

A while back I wrote a Shiny app ([site](https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/acnh-swipe/), [source](https://github.com/matt-dray/acnh-swipe), [blogpost](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/06/06/acnh-swipe/)) for [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/2e9bd5a67e09b14d01f616b00f7f7e0931515d24/data/2020/2020-05-05) to replicate a [Tinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinder_(app))-like experience using villagers from [Nintendo's _Animal Crossing New Horizons_ game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Horizons). It uses the swipe mechanic from [Nick Strayer's {shinysense} package](http://nickstrayer.me/shinysense/) to gauge popularity: left for a 'dislike', right for a 'like'.

After exceeding 3000 total swipes, it's time to take a look at the results.

# Oh sheet

Data from each swipe in the app is automatically appended to [a public Google Sheets sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kMbmav6XvYqnTO202deyZQh37JeWtTK4ThIXdxGmEbs/) that can be read with {googlesheets4}. Public sheets don't require authentication to download, so run `gs4_deauth()` before `read_sheet()` to prevent it.

```{r}
library(googlesheets4)
gs4_deauth()

raw <- read_sheet(
  ss = "1kMbmav6XvYqnTO202deyZQh37JeWtTK4ThIXdxGmEbs",
  col_types = "Tcc"  # datetime, char, char
)
```

First thing is to isolate the left and right swipes only. The {shinysense} package also allows for up and down swipes by default and I didn't remove this capability from my app.

```{r}
dat <- raw[raw$swipe %in% c("left", "right"), ]
dat[sample(rownames(dat), 5), ]  # random sample
```

The data are one row per swipe, with columns for `date` (datetime of when the swipe happened), `name` (the villager's name) and `swipe` (the swipe direction). 

But what we're really after is a grouped table with a row per villager, plus new columns for the `total` number of swipes, the `diff`erence between right and left swipes and the percentage of swipes that were to the right (`pc_right`). These will let us better rank the characters.

```{r}
df <- with(dat, table(name, swipe)) |>  # like dplyr::count()
  as.data.frame(responseName = "n") |>
  reshape(  # like tidyr::pivot_*()
    v.names   = "n",      # values_from
    idvar     = "name",   # id_cols
    timevar   = "swipe",  # names_from
    direction = "wide",   # i.e. pivot_wider()
    sep       = "_"       # names_sep
  ) |> 
  transform(  # like dplyr::mutate()
    total    = n_left + n_right,
    diff     = n_right - n_left,
    pc_right = 100 * round(n_right / (n_right + n_left), 2)
  )

head(df)
```

I think most readers of this blog are probably {tidyverse} users, so I'll explain some of the base R approach I took here:

* I've used the base pipe (`|>`) introduced in R v4.1 to chain the functions, which is analogous to {magrittr}'s pipe (`%>%`) in this example
* `with()` allows the bare column names in `table()` to be evaluated as columns of `dat`, which means you only write the name of the data object once
* a `table()` coerced with `as.data.frame()` is equivalent to `dplyr::count()`, basically
* `reshape()` can be used like `tidyr::pivot_wider()` (I've added comments in the code block above to show how the arguments are used)
* [turns out](https://twitter.com/kearneymw/status/1476538812406788101) that `transform()` can be used like `dplyr::mutate()` to create new columns, thought the help files say it should only be used for interactive and that 'you deserve whatever you get!'

We can also bring in [some additional villager data collected for TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/2e9bd5a67e09b14d01f616b00f7f7e0931515d24/data/2020/2020-05-05) and join it to the swipe data. This will come in useful later.

```{r}
tt <- read.csv(
  paste0(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/",
    "2e9bd5a67e09b14d01f616b00f7f7e0931515d24/data/",
    "2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"
  )
)

df <- merge(df, tt, by = "name")
```

# New Horizons scanning

There are `r length(df$name)` villagers represented in these data, with a combined total of `r nrow(dat)` legitimate swipes.

The total swipes per villager ranged from `r min(df$total)` to `r max(df$total)`, with a mean of `r round(mean(df$total), 1)`Â±`r round(sd(df$total), 1)`, so some characters didn't really get enough swipes for proper assessment. You'd better go to the app and add some more swipes, eh?

```{r}
par(bg = "lightgreen")
hist(
  df$total,
  main = "Distribution of total swipes per villager",
  xlab = "Total swipes",
  col = "lightblue",
  las = 1
)
```

If we focus on right swipes (i.e. 'like') adjusted for the total swipes per character, we can see that the distribution isn't quite normal. The frequency of swipes below 50% is `r nrow(df[df$pc_right < 50, ])` and above 50% is `r nrow(df[df$pc_right > 50, ])`. This implies that the majority of characters were disliked in a binary sense.

```{r}
par(bg = "lightgreen")
hist(
  df$pc_right,
  main = "Distribution of right swipes per villager",
  xlab = "Right swipes (%)",
  col = "lightblue",
  las = 1
)
```

The bins at 0 and 100% tell you that there were some characters that were met with universal disapproval and approval, while the bin at 50% tells us that same characters split people's opinions. Which were they?

# Drumroll, please

So, onto the villager rankings.

I've written a little function to output an HTML table where each character's name links to their profile on [the Animal Crossing Wiki](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Animal_Crossing_Wiki) and exposes their photo from [VillagerDB](https://villagerdb.com/).

```{r}
entable <- function(df) {
  df$url <- paste0(
    "<img src='", df$url, "' ",
    "width=50 ",
    "alt='Animal Crossing villager ", df$name,"'>"
  )
  df$name <- paste0(
    "<a href='https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/",
    df$name, "'>", df$name, "</a>"
  )
  df <- df[, c("name", "url", "pc_right", "total")]
  names(df) <- c("Name", "Picture", "Right swipes (%)", "Total swipes")
  rownames(df) <- NULL
  knitr::kable(df)
}
```

## Least popular

To build tension, we'll start with the least-liked villagers. 

```{r}
bot <- df[order(df$pc_right, -df$n_left), ] |> head()
entable(bot)
```

Sorry Pinky. You are simply... too pink? Seems harsh.

## Most polarising

To build even more tension, let's look at the characters who had a 50:50 ratio of likes to dislikes.

```{r}
meh <- subset(df[order(-df$total), ], diff == 0) |> head()
entable(meh)
```

I'm not sure why these villagers are so controversial Perhaps they're too 'plain' for some people? What's for sure is that Cole... well, he's seen some things.

## Most popular

And finally, what you've all been waiting for.

```{r}
top <- df[order(-df$pc_right, -df$n_right), ] |> head()
entable(top)
```

So! Bea and Bill were unanimously approved with nine right swipes each. It's not hard to see why these might be favourites; they're cute. Although Bill is staring directly into my soul.

# Speciesism!

I know what you're thinking: the results are on a villager-by-villager basis, but which species are the most popular? We can aggregate swipes and take a look.

```{r}
sp_l <- aggregate(n_left ~ species, sum, data = df)
sp_r <- aggregate(n_right ~ species, sum, data = df)
sp_n <- with(df, table(species)) |> 
  as.data.frame(responseName = "n_villagers")

sp <- sp_n |> 
  merge(sp_l, by = "species") |> 
  merge(sp_r, by = "species") |> 
  transform(
    total = n_right + n_left,
    pc_right = 100 * round(n_right / (n_right + n_left), 2)
  )
```

First, the species ranked by lowest proportion of right swipes.

```{r}
sp_bot <- sp[order(sp$pc_right, -sp$n_left), ]
rownames(sp_bot) <- NULL
head(sp_bot)
```

I can see how eagles, monkeys and hippos might not be that 'cute', per se, but what about [the mice](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Mouse)? Although 'cute' is probably not the best term for [the cranky mouse Limberg](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Limberg) (sorry Limberg).

What about the most liked species?

```{r}
sp_top <- sp[order(-sp$pc_right, sp$n_right), ]
rownames(sp_top) <- NULL
head(sp_top)
```
[Octopuses are on top](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Octopus_(villager)), although there's relatively few octopus villagers. Personally, I like [Zucker](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Zucker), an octopus who looks like takoyaki and therefore delicious. 

This wasn't meant to be about villager tastiness, was it? We may need a new app to rank by apparent edibility...
