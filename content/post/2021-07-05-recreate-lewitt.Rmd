# LeWitt ReMix

The third [#RecreationThursday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23recreationthursday) challenge involved Sol LeWitt's _Colour Bands_ (2000), [which you can see on his website](https://www.sollewittprints.org/artwork/lewitt-raisonne-2000-07/).

Rather than recreate his artworks exactly, I decided to riff on the approach with a Shiny app, which adds different types of lines and some randomisation.

You can access it here (until I take it down): [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shiny-shinyapps.io-blue?style=flat&labelColor=white&logo=RStudio&logoColor=blue)](https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/lewitt-remix-app/)

Alternatively, download and launch it locally via an R session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
shiny::runGitHub(
  "viz-recreation", "matt-dray", "main",
  "2021-07-01_rt_lewitt/lewitt-remix-app"
)
```

Change a few parameters and then hit the 'Generate' button for a new variant, which can be downloaded to your computer.

You could create something that looks similar to LeWitt's original, or go off-piste and create a much larger number of panels or much thicker lines. Have fun!

Read on for an explanation and for some examples.

# Approach

Once again, I've used only base R functions to generate the outputs, just like [my previous #RecreationThursday attempt ](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/06/21/recreate-hlito/).

I've used a cunning shortcut to mimic LeWitt: rather than draw any lines or shapes, I've just over-plotted points of decreasing size with [R's built-in plotting characters](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/graphics/html/points.html) (e.g. `21` is a filled circle, `22` a square). This gives the effect of concentric lines.

Here's an example of plotting 50 unfilled circles of decreasing size on the same xy point:

```{r fig.alt='Concentric circles coloured consecutively with colours of the rainbow.'}
# Set variables
shape <- 21  # plotting character
shp_n <- 50  # number of points to plot
shp_x <- 2   # point size multiplier
pal   <- rainbow(5)  # colours

# Set margins to zero, see only the plot
par(mar = rep(0, 4))

# Plot 'concentric circles'
plot(
  x    = rep(0, shp_n),
  y    = rep(0, shp_n),
  axes = FALSE,
  pch  = shape,
  cex  = shp_x * shp_n:1,
  col  = pal
)
```

There are [two underlying custom functions](https://github.com/matt-dray/viz-recreation/blob/main/2021-07-01_rt_lewitt/lewitt-remix-app/global.R): one generates a single-panel LeWitt remix and the other calls multiple of these panels into a grid, with randomised features.

The arguments include the plotting character, the position that the centre of the point-stack will take (cardinal directions, like `NE` to place the origin in the top-right), the colours, the number of shapes to overplot, the apparent 'thickness' of the 'lines' in the output, and the width of the box[^box] that surrounds the image.

So here's a demo of the function that generates a single panel. It uses uses the triangle plotting characters, which originate in the centre and alternate through rainbow colours.

```{r fig.alt='A square image with a black border that contains concentric triangles coloured consecutively with rainbow colours.'}
# Grab the functions from the repo
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/viz-recreation/main/2021-07-01_rt_lewitt/lewitt-remix-app/global.R")

# Demo: plot a single panel
just_lewitt(
  shape = 24,          # triangle plotting character
  place = "C",         # 'centre'
  pal   = rainbow(7),  # colours
  shp_n = 200,         # number of points to plot
  shp_x = 4,           # 'line thickness'
  box_w = 20           # outer box thickness
)
```

And below is a panel made of four calls to the single-panel function. Elements like shape and the placement of the origin point are randomised. 

Also, rather than use LeWitt's colouring scheme, I decided to randomise the colour palette by sampling seven colours from R's built-in named `colours()`. This can produce some pretty garish results, but also some quite pleasing ones too. (I'm colourblind, so your mileage may vary.)

```{r fig.alt='A square image containing four panels in a two by two grid. Each panel contains concentric patterns of squares, triangles or circles with an alternating randomised colour palette. Each panel has a thick black border around it.'}
# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(5)

# Set up a colour palette
my_pal <- sample(colours(), 7)

# Demo: plot a grid of randomised panels
just_lewitt2(
  dimn  = 2,       # x and y dimensions of grid
  pal   = my_pal,  # colour palette
  shp_x = 4,       # 'line thickness'
  box_w = 10       # outer box thickness
)
```

This can end up looking like an eye-popping Magic Eye puzzle.

```{r fig.alt='A square image containing 100 panels in a 10 by 10 grid. Each panel contains concentric patterns of squares, triangles or circles with an alternating randomised colour palette. There are no borders around each panel.'}
set.seed(7)
just_lewitt2(
  dimn  = 10,
  pal   = sample(colours(), 7),
  shp_x = 1,
  box_w = 0
)
```

Or a bit like semaphore.

```{r fig.alt='A square image containing four panels in a two by two grid. Each panel contains concentric patterns of squares, triangles or circles with an alternating randomised colour palette. The lines created by the concentric shapes appear thick. There are no borders around each panel.'}
set.seed(7)
just_lewitt2(
  dimn  = 2,
  pal   = sample(colours(), 7),
  shp_x = 20,
  box_w = 0
)
```

Or whatever this is.

```{r fig.alt='A square image containing 100 panels in a 10 by 10 grid. Each panel contains concentric patterns of squares, triangles or circles with an alternating randomised colour palette. The lines created by the concentric shapes appear thin. There are extremely thick black borders around each panel.'}
set.seed(2)
just_lewitt2(
  dimn  = 10,
  pal   = sample(colours(), 7),
  shp_x = 1,
  box_w = 20
)
```

Uh-oh, I think I may have slipped through space-time.

```{r fig.alt='A square image containing four panels in a two by two grid. Each panel contains concentric patterns of squares or circles with an alternating randomised colour palette. The lines created by the concentric shapes appear extremely thin. There are no borders around the panels. The patterns give a slight impression of motion.'}
set.seed(11)
just_lewitt2(
  dimn  = 2,
  pal   = sample(colours(), 7),
  shp_x = 0.4,
  box_w = 0
)
```

The Shiny app basically plays around with these function arguments depending on your inputs, providing some randomness with a new seed that's generated with each click of the 'Generate' button or if you move any of the sliders.

[^box]: Boxes are drawn on a panel-by-panel basis, so the 'interior' borders appear thicker because of the additive effect of surrounding boxes.
