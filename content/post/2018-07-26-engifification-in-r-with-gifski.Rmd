# `gifski::gifski()`

You and I both know that the world needs more intergalatic-sloth-pizza gifs.

Great news: 'the fastest gif encoder in the universe' has been created. The [`gifski` package for R is now in CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gifski/index.html). It's a simple yet fast and powerful way to create gifs from within R, built by Jeroen Oom ([\@opencpu](https://twitter.com/OpenCPU)) for [ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/).

The obvious application is for creating gifs from plots, as in the following example from [the ROpenSci announcement](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/07/23/gifski-release/).

# `dray::make_gif()`

I've made a quick function for my `dray` package that -- in one line of code -- takes a folder of PNGs and stitches them into a gif using the `gifski::gifski()` function. I've called it `make_gif()` because it makes gifs. Mostly I've done this for my own benefit, but maybe you'll find it useful too.

You can [find the documentation on the `dray` package site](https://matt-dray.github.io/dray/), which is built with [the awesome `pkgdown` package](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/).

Also I'm endorsing the verb 'to *engif*' as in 'I am *engiffing* a bunch of PNGs'. Join me.

# Example

There's an example of producing a hand-made gif (i.e. an *artisanal* gif) on the gifski help pages (execute `?gifski` in your console). It looks like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
png_path <- file.path(tempdir(), "frame%03d.png")
png(png_path)
par(ask = FALSE)
for(i in 1:10)
  plot(rnorm(i * 10), main = i)
dev.off()
png_files <- sprintf(png_path, 1:10)
gif_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".gif")
gifski(png_files, gif_file)
unlink(png_files)
utils::browseURL(gif_file)
```

With `dray::make_gif()` you supply two things:

1. a path to a folder containing the images
2. a path for where the gif should be written

```{r eval=FALSE}
dray::make_gif(
  png_folder = "img",  # folder containing PNGs
  gif_path = "gif/intergalactic-sloth-pizza.gif"  # path for the output
)
```

I created the following very important gif with `make_gif()` from seven PNG images.

You should make sure your PNGs are ordered alphabetically or numerically in the folder so that they're *engiffed* (see, isn't that a great verb?) in the right order. Don't worry if your folder has other filetypes; `make_gif()` only extracts PNGs. You'll get a warning if you try to make a gif with less than two PNGs, obviously.

So get out there and *engif* to your heart's content!
