# gifski

[The `gifski' package for R has been released](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/07/23/gifski-release/). It was built by Jeroen Oom ([\@opencpu](https://twitter.com/OpenCPU)) for [ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/).

# make_gif()

I've made a quick function for my `dray` package that takes a folder of PNGs and stitches them into a gif using the `gifski::gifski()` function. I've called it `make_gif()` because it makes gifs.

You can find the documentation on the `dray` package site, which is built with `pkgdown`.

# Example

With plain `gifski()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
1+1
```

With `make_gif()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
dray::make_gif(
  png_folder = "img",  # folder containing PNGs
  gif_path = "gif/lotad_evo.gif"  # path for the output
)
```
