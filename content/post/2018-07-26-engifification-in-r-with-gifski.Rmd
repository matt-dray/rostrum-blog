# `gifski()`

You and I both know that the world needs more intergalatic-sloth-pizza gifs.

Great news: 'the fastest gif encoder in the universe' has been created. The [{gifski} package for R is now on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gifski/index.html){target='_blank'}. It's a simple yet fast and powerful way to create gifs from within R, built by [Jeroen Ooms](https://twitter.com/OpenCPU){target='_blank'}) for [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/){target='_blank'}.

The obvious application is for creating gifs from plots, as in the following example from [the ROpenSci announcement](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/07/23/gifski-release/){target='_blank'}, which shows life expectancy by GDP per capita with a different year for each frame of the gif.

# `make_gif()`

I've made a quick function for my {dray} package that--in one line of code--takes a folder of PNGs and stitches them into a gif using the `gifski::gifski()` function. I've called it `make_gif()` because it makes gifs. Mostly I've done this for my own benefit, but maybe you'll find it useful too.

You can [find the documentation on the {dray} package site](https://matt-dray.github.io/dray/){target='_blank'}, which is built with [the awesome {pkgdown} package](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/){target='_blank'}.

Also I'm endorsing the verb 'to engif' as in 'I am engiffing a bunch of PNGs'.

# Example

There's an example of producing a hand-made gif (i.e. an artisanal gif) on the gifski help pages (execute `?gifski` in your console). It looks like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
png_path <- file.path(tempdir(), "frame%03d.png")
png(png_path)
par(ask = FALSE)
for(i in 1:10)
  plot(rnorm(i * 10), main = i)
dev.off()
png_files <- sprintf(png_path, 1:10)
gif_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".gif")
gifski(png_files, gif_file)
unlink(png_files)
utils::browseURL(gif_file)
```

With `dray::make_gif()` you supply two things:

1. a path to a folder containing the images
2. a path for where the gif should be written

```{r eval=FALSE}
dray::make_gif(
  png_folder = "img",  # folder containing PNGs
  gif_path = "gif/intergalactic-sloth-pizza.gif"  # path for the output
)
```

I created the following very important gif with `make_gif()` from seven PNG images.

<p class="caption">Lotad is the best</p>
</div>

You should make sure your PNGs are ordered alphabetically or numerically in the folder so that they're engiffed (see, isn't that a great verb?) in the right order. Don't worry if your folder has other filetypes; `make_gif()` only extracts PNGs. You'll get a warning if you try to make a gif with less than two PNGs.

So get out there and get engiffing.

# Other packages to consider

Consider also:

* {magick}, also by Jeroen Ooms for rOpenSci, which lets you use the power of [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php){target='_blank'} to manipulate your images before turning them into a gif ([website](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/){target='_blank'}, [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html){target='_blank'})
* {gganimate} for animating plots by [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://www.data-imaginist.com/){target='_blank'} and [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/){target='_blank'} ([website](https://gganimate.com/){target='_blank'}), which uses {gifski} as its renderer, though you can also use ffmpeg
