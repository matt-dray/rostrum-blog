# tl;dr 

[Emi Tanaka](https://emitanaka.org/){target='_blank'}'s [Ninjutsu](https://emitanaka.org/ninja-theme/themes/kunoichi/kunoichi-theme-example.html#6){target='_blank'} CSS for [{xaringan}](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1){target='_blank'} breaks slides into 'cells', which are useful for arranging plots, tables, etc. [I've been experimenting](https://matt-dray.github.io/ninja-scaffold/){target='_blank'} with Emi's CSS to create my own layouts.

# Slide themes

The [{xaringan}](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1){target='_blank'} package by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/){target='_blank'} -- an implementation of [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark){target='_blank'} -- lets you create reproducible slides with R.

You can create your own themes for {xaringan} by supplying some [CSS](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets){target='_blank'}. Yihui has [encouraged users](https://yihui.org/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes/){target='_blank'} to add their themes to the package itself.

Tip: if you don't know CSS, [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/){target='_blank'}'s [{xaringanthemer}](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/xaringanthemer/){target='_blank'} package lets you write R code and will generate the corresponding CSS for you.

# Slide layouts

I was given a brief to create slides with a particular layout of page elements (plots, tables, text). How could I create a 'scaffold' in {xaringan} into which I could place the page elements?

Fortunately, [Emi Tanaka](https://twitter.com/statsgen){target='_blank'}[^emitanaka] created [Ninjutsu](https://emitanaka.org/ninja-theme/themes/kunoichi/kunoichi-theme-example.html#7){target='_blank'}[^ninjutsu]: CSS classes for splitting your page into columns and rows. This is now built into {xaringan} along with [her Kunoichi theme](https://emitanaka.org/ninja-theme/themes/kunoichi/kunoichi-theme-example.html#1){target='_blank'}[^kunoichi].

For example, the `split-1-2-1` class from Ninjutsu splits the slide into three columns that are 25%, 50% and 25% of the total page width (hence '1-2-1').

```{css, split121}
.split-1-2-1>.column:first-of-type {
  width: 25%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; 
}
.split-1-2-1>.column:nth-of-type(2) {
  width: 50%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 25%;
}
.split-1-2-1>.column:nth-of-type(3) {
  width: 25%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0;
}
```

There's one line of CSS for each of the three columns that the slide will be split into. In this example, the first column (`first-of-type`) starts from the extreme left (`left: 0;`), the middle column (`nth-of-type(2)`) starts where the first one ends (`left: 25%;`) and the third one (`nth-of-type(3)`) starts from the extreme right (`right: 0;`).

# Demo: ninja scaffold

I adapted Emi's CSS to create the layouts I wanted. You can:

* [find the source on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/ninja-scaffold){target='_blank'}
* [inspect the relevant custom CSS](https://github.com/matt-dray/ninja-scaffold/blob/master/custom.css){target='_blank'}
* [see a demo slideshow](https://matt-dray.github.io/ninja-scaffold/){target='_blank'}, or view it embedded below

Read the rest of this post for an explanation of how I did it.

# Adapting the layout

Specifically, I wanted to define title, body and footer-bar sections for:

* a title page
* a main, generic content page
* a content page that could show a table and plot next to each other, with a wider table underneath

This means I could colour them and/or fill them with content according to some additional CSS formatting.

To do this, I tweaked Emi's `split-1-2-1` class to create classes with rows (rather than columns) split into the sections I wanted.

Below are some simplified examples of what I did. You can [see the original CSS in the source code](https://github.com/matt-dray/ninja-scaffold/blob/master/custom.css){target='_blank'} of the demo I've put on GitHub.

## Defining the classes

The title page has two rows, one is a large header area to hold a logo and the other is where the talk metadata goes ([see demo](https://matt-dray.github.io/ninja-scaffold/#5){target='_blank'}):

```{css}
.split-title>.row:first-of-type {
  height: 35%; width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;
}
.split-title>.row:nth-of-type(2) {
  height: 65%; width: 100%; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 35%;
}
```

The main slide class has a title and footer section and the content goes in the large section between ([see demo](https://matt-dray.github.io/ninja-scaffold/#6){target='_blank'}):

```{css}
.split-main1>.row:first-of-type {
  height: 15%; width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;
}
.split-main1>.row:nth-of-type(2) {
  height: 80%; width: 100%; position: absolute; left: 0; bottom: 5%;
}
.split-main1>.row:nth-of-type(3) {
  height: 5%; width: 100%; position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0;
}
```

I modified slightly this class so the large blank area is split once more ([see demo](https://matt-dray.github.io/ninja-scaffold/#7){target='_blank'}):

```{css}
.split-main2>.row:first-of-type { 
  height: 15%; width: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;
}
.split-main2>.row:nth-of-type(2) { 
  height: 40%; width: 100%; position: absolute; left: 0; top: 15%;
}
.split-main2>.row:nth-of-type(3) { 
  height: 40%; width: 100%; position: absolute; left: 0; bottom: 5%;
}
.split-main2>.row:nth-of-type(4) { 
  height: 5%; width: 100%; position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0;
}
```

## Using the classes

Having defined the CSS, how do we use it?

Let's say I'd saved this CSS into a file called `custom.CSS`, along with some font specifications in `custom-fonts.CSS`. Here's a simplified YAML header showing how to declare these CSS files in your {xaringan} .Rmd file:

```
---
title: "Example Title"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, ninjutsu, custom.css, custom-fonts.css]
---
```

The CSS files are listed in this order so that the later-listed files take precedence if there's any clashes. Remember also that in-built themes don't need the `.css` file extension, but you need to provide the full path for any custom CSS.

With {xaringan} you name the class at the top of a slide to actually apply it, where slides are defined by three hyphens `---`.

You can [see an example in the source code](https://github.com/matt-dray/ninja-scaffold/blob/master/index.Rmd){target='_blank'} of the demo I put on GitHub.

### Class `split-main1`

So, the `split-main1` could be used like this:

```{r example-split-main1}
---
class: split-main1

.row[.content[
This Is A Title
]]

.row[.content[
This is the main body area of the slide.
]]
```

Remember that the `split-main1` class is split into three separate rows for the title, main body and footer sections. We can define what's in each row with `.row[]` and then define the content inside a call to `.content[]`. 

The first `.row[]` call will take the style from `.split-main1>.row:first-of-type` in our CSS, the second will take the CSS information from `.split-main1>.row:nth-of-type(2)`, and so on.

Note that Ninjutsu also lets you adjust the content of classes by chaining calls like `.content.vmiddle[]`, which will make the content vertically centred in this case.

### Class `split-main2`

The `split-main2` class has an additional `.row[]` to define because the main body area is composed of two rows rather than one. 

Here I've added a `split-two[]` call inside the second `.row[]` call and declared `.column[]` twice within it. This results the main body area containing one row the width of the page and one row split into two columns ([see demo](https://matt-dray.github.io/ninja-scaffold/#8){target='_blank'}).

```{r example-split-main2}
---
class: split-main2

.row[.content[
This Is A Title
]]

.row[.content[
This is the second row of the page. It's full-width.
]]

.row[.content[
.split-two[
.column[.content[
This is the third row, which is split in two. This is the left column.
]]
.column[.content[
This is the right-hand column of the third row.
]]
]
]]

.row[
]
```

# What now?

I think there's a lot of promise in this approach for making bespoke page layouts.

I've already used this approach at work to design a {xaringan} template to a specification, which I used to help automate the generation of a large number of reports. In particular, I used the `split-main2` class to arrange a small table in the top-left, a plot in the top-right, and a full-width wide table below them.

It's possible to create these kinds of layouts in other ways -- [like in {pagedown}](https://github.com/mattkerlogue/pagedown-test){target='_blank'} or with [fancier CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp){target='_blank'} skills. For now I'm most comfortable with {xaringan} and the features it offers, like presenter notes and presenter view. But this is probably less important if your goal is [to output to PDF](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/03/12/knit-with-params/#demo-ninja-knitting){target='_blank'}.

I look forward to seeing how Ninjutsu and other {xaringan} themes develop to help with page layouts for reproducible presentations.
