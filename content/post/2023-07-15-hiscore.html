<div id="tldr" class="section level1">
<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>You can save your high score in games made with R. See <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/hiscore">the package {hiscore}</a> for a demo.</p>
</div>
<div id="boot-up" class="section level1">
<h1>Boot up</h1>
<p>I wrote recently about how <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2023/04/02/splendid-r-games/">R is a game engine</a> and started <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/splendid-r-games">a list of games written in R</a>.</p>
<p>All good game engines should let you save a high score, right?</p>
<p>So I’ve done exactly this for a tiny concept package called <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/hiscore">{hiscore}</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> that contains a simple game of luck</p>
<p>The package runs code that saves your high score, which is retained between play sessions.</p>
</div>
<div id="install" class="section level1">
<h1>Install</h1>
<p>You can install the package <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/hiscore">from GitHub</a>. It has no dependencies, but you’ll need to be running R version 4, at least.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.package(&quot;remotes&quot;)  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github(&quot;matt-dray/hiscore&quot;)
library(hiscore)</code></pre>
<p>Of course, it’s just a concept and I’ve intentionally kept this as trivial as possible, but you can <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/hiscore/issues">leave an issue</a> with bugs or ideas.</p>
</div>
<div id="play" class="section level1">
<h1>Play</h1>
<p>For demonstration purposes, the inbuilt game is super simple: get the longest streak of correctly guessed coinflips.</p>
<p>To play, run <code>play_coinflip()</code> and type <kbd>H</kbd> or <kbd>T</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> when prompted. Basically, a coinflip is simulated with <code>sample(c("H", "T"), 1)</code> and then compared to the user’s input, supplied from the console following a <code>readline()</code> call.</p>
<p>Keep going until you get it wrong. If you get a new high score, it’ll be saved.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>play_coinflip()</code></pre>
<pre><code>[H]eads or [T]ails? Answer: H
Correct! Current score: 1
[H]eads or [T]ails? Answer: H
Incorrect! Final score: 1
New high score!
New high score saved.</code></pre>
<p>You can retrieve the current high score with <code>get_save_data()</code>, which returns a little table.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_save_data()</code></pre>
<pre><code>game high_score
1 coinflip          1</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you could also set up the function so that it records different player names too. And you could add additional games that would get their own row in this table.</p>
</div>
<div id="memory" class="section level1">
<h1>Memory</h1>
<p>Note that the high score data is retained on your computer even if you restart your session or reboot your machine. How so?</p>
<p>This is thanks to <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/tools/userdir.html">the <code>tools::R_user_dir()</code> function</a>, which was added to R in version 4.0. It builds system-specific paths to ‘directories for storing R-related user-specific data, configuration and cache files’ where you can save package-related information.</p>
<p>{hiscore} records top scores in this fashion. On my machine, the save location resolves to the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tools::R_user_dir(&quot;hiscore&quot;, &quot;data&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;/Users/mattdray/Library/Application Support/org.R-project.R/R/hiscore&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Regular readers may remember that I used <code>R_user_dir()</code> in the {tamRgo} package (<a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/11/13/tamrgo/">blog</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo">source</a>), which lets you look after a Tamagotchi-style cyber-pet in your console. I used the function to save a pet’s ‘blueprint’ (details such as name, age and hunger level) persistently.</p>
</div>
<div id="retry" class="section level1">
<h1>Retry</h1>
<p>Now imagine you want to retry to beat that incredible top score of 1. Since you last played, you probably restarted your session or computer.</p>
<pre><code>Restarting R session...</code></pre>
<p>But never fear: the high score was retained. You can see that when you run <code>play_coinflip()</code> again and are reminded of the current best.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(hiscore)
play_coinflip()</code></pre>
<pre><code>Welcome. Your current high score is 1
[H]eads or [T]ails? Answer: h
Correct! Current score: 1
[H]eads or [T]ails? Answer: t
Correct! Current score: 2
[H]eads or [T]ails? Answer: h
Incorrect! Final score: 2
New high score!
New high score saved.</code></pre>
<p>Great job, you doubled the previous record!</p>
<p>When you get a game over, the <code>play_coinflip()</code> function checks the current high score and compares it to the final score for the current play session. The saved data is overwritten if the score is higher.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_save_data()</code></pre>
<pre><code>      game high_score
1 coinflip          2</code></pre>
<p>I think it’s a good idea to make it easy for people to destroy the stored data if they want, which you can do easily with <code>delete_save_data()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>delete_save_data()</code></pre>
<pre><code>Really delete? [Y]es/[N]o: Y
High score data deleted.</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="game-over" class="section level1">
<h1>Game over</h1>
<p>How else could this approach be used in an R gaming perspective? You could use this to save a game state, similar to what’s done for <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/11/13/tamrgo/">{tamRgo}</a>. The user could input <code>S</code>ave instead of performing a guess, which would record the current status of the game so the user can return later. But that would feel like cheating for a game like coinflip.</p>
<p>Speaking of, here’s a cheatcode as a bonus for reading this far:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cheat &lt;- function(game, score) {
  user_dir &lt;- tools::R_user_dir(&quot;hiscore&quot;, &quot;data&quot;)
  score_path &lt;- file.path(user_dir, &quot;score_table.rds&quot;)
  score_table &lt;- readRDS(score_path)
  score_game &lt;- score_table[score_table[[&quot;game&quot;]] == game, ]
  score_game[[&quot;high_score&quot;]] &lt;- score
  saveRDS(score_table, score_path)
  message(&quot;Congrats! You scored &quot;, score, &quot; at &quot;, game, &quot;!&quot;)
}

cheat(&quot;coinflip&quot;, 1e100)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Congrats! You scored 1e+100 at coinflip!</code></pre>
<p>Heh heh heh.</p>
