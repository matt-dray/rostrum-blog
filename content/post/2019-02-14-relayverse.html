<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>I made an interactive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory">graph network</a> of the podcast host relationships on <a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a> using R. <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/output/relayverse.html">You can interact with it in a separate window</a> and find out below how it was made.</p>
<p>I refreshed the data and style of the visualisation on 11 Sep 2019.</p>

<h1>Podcast networks</h1>
<p>Podcasting is becoming big business. Music-streaming giant <a href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/">Spotify</a> <a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2019/Spotify-Announces-Strategic-Acquisitions-to-Accelerate-Growth-in-Podcasting/default.aspx">just acquired</a> the podcast network <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/">Gimlet</a> for <a href="https://www.recode.net/2019/2/1/18207198/spotify-gimlet-podcast-acquisition">a reported $200 million</a>.</p>
<p>Other networks include <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/">The Incomparable</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a> and <a href="https://www.radiotopia.fm/">Radiotopia</a>. Such networks can boost revenue and listener numbers and provide access to expertise, management and resources.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a> is a network that focuses largely on tech content<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. It was started by <a href="https//www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley">Myke Hurley</a> and <a href="https//www.relay.fm/people/stephenhackett">Stephen Hackett</a> in 2014 and you can find a list of <a href="https://www.relay.fm/shows">shows</a> and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/people">personnel</a> on their site. Many of Relay FM’s hosts have hosted more than one podcast within the network. What do the relationships between them look like?</p>
<p>This post is about preparing and visualising this ‘Relayverse’ using the R packages <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/"><code>tidygraph</code> for network data handling</a> and <a href="https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/ggraph.html"><code>ggraph</code> for network visualisation</a> (both by <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasp85">Thomas Lin Pedersen</a>), along with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/visNetwork/vignettes/Introduction-to-visNetwork.html">the <code>visNetwork</code> package</a> (from Benoit Thieurmel and Titouan Robert of <a href="http://www.datastorm.fr/">Datastorm</a>, wrapping <a href="http://visjs.org">Almende BV’s <code>vis.js</code> library</a>) for interactive visualisation.</p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom to find the interactive tool if you aren’t interested in the code.</p>

<div id="packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Packages</h1>
<p>I’m using two suites of ‘tidy’ packages in this post: one set for data collection and manipulation, and one set for graph network building, analysis and visualisation.</p>

<h1>Harvest data</h1>
<p>We can use <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/">the <code>rvest</code> package</a> by <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a> to scrape podcast details from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_FM">the Wikipedia page for Relay FM</a>. There are two separate tables: one for current and one for retired (discontinued) shows.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the host names are in the form ‘First LastFirst Last’ so we need a regular expression to split the string where a lowercase letter meets an uppercase letter<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.

<p>Notice there were a couple of cleaning steps there to remove the text ‘formerly hosted by’ and the names of the former hosts. There’s one instance where this protocol isn’t followed in the table and the host’s name is followed by ‘(originally)’. I removed the text with regex, but then just removed the host’s name manually with a <code>filter()</code> to avoid some complex regex.</p>
<p>Our data frame is now tidy and ready for Tidygraph, but before moving on, we can do things like look at the host with the most active shows.</p>

<h1>Tidygraph</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/">tidygraph package</a> was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasp85">Thomas Lin Pedersen</a>. It is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an entry into <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">the tidyverse</a> that provides a tidy framework for all things relational (networks/graphs, trees, etc)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use the package, we need every host combination<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> for each podcast, which can be achieved with the <code>combn()</code> function. This gives us a pair of points (‘nodes’ in graph-speak) that can be connected by a line (an ‘edge’) to indicate their relationship.</p>
<p>But a show with one host doesn’t have a pair of points, so I’m going to duplicate these rows first. If we don’t do this, we can’t plot these shows because they won’t have a connection between two nodes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Isolate the shows with one host 
solo_vec &lt;- shows_clean %&gt;%
  count(Podcast) %&gt;%
  filter(n == 1) %&gt;%
  pull(Podcast)

# Filter the show-host dataframe by solo-hosted podcasts
solo_df &lt;- filter(shows_clean, Podcast %in% solo_vec)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can bind these rows to the data and then get our host combinations. Big shout out to <a href="https://www.williamrchase.com/post/finding-combinations-in-the-tidyverse/">William Chase</a> for a solution to getting all combinations of elements within some parent element (e.g. hosts within podcasts).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Prepare host combinations per show
relay_combos &lt;- shows_clean %&gt;%
  bind_rows(solo_df) %&gt;%  # to duplicate the shows with solo hosts
  group_by(Podcast) %&gt;%  # operate within each podcast
  split(.$Podcast) %&gt;%  # split on podcast
  map(., 2) %&gt;%  # gets vector of hosts per podcast list element
  map(~combn(.x, m = 2)) %&gt;%   # all pair combiantions
  map(~t(.x)) %&gt;%  # transpose the matrix
  map(as_tibble) %&gt;%  # convert to a tibble dataframe
  bind_rows(.id = &quot;Podcast&quot;) %&gt;%  # list-element name to column
  select(V1, V2, Podcast)

<p>We can turn this data frame of host-pair combinations into a tidygraph object with the <code>as_tbl_graph()</code> function. This class of object contains two data frames (the nodes and the edges) and some metadata.</p>
<p>We can also use functions from the <code>tidygraph</code> package to help calculate various network statistics. For example, the <code>centrality_degree()</code> function tells us the nodes with the most connections. We can add this as a column in our node data and use this later to do things like resize nodes depending on their centrality.</p>
<p>You can manipulate the nodes and edges data frames in this tidygraph object by using the <code>activate()</code> function to switch between them. Currently the node data are active (it says ‘active’ above the nodes data frame), so our application of <code>centrality_degree()</code> to the network object will affect the node data specifically.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>relay_graph &lt;- as_tbl_graph(relay_combos, directed = FALSE)%&gt;% 
  mutate(connections = centrality_degree()) %&gt;%  # number of connections
  arrange(desc(connections))  # order by number of shows

print(relay_graph)  </code></pre>

<p>The edges and nodes are now in the same object. You can see we have about 38 nodes and 64 edges and that the network is undirected (nodes don’t ‘point’ to each other). We also have eight ‘components’, which are the isolated groups of nodes that connect to each other, but not to other groups.</p>

<h2>Static with <code>ggraph</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/ggraph.html">The <code>ggraph</code> package</a> was designed to work seamlessly with <code>tidygraph</code> objects and the <code>ggplot2</code> plotting package. You simply pass your <code>tidygraph</code> object to <code>ggraph</code>‘s ’graph’ argument. Below are a couple of examples for demonstration purposes that show you just a handful of options. You can learn more about <code>ggraph</code>’s <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-layouts/">layouts</a>, <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-nodes/">nodes</a> and <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-edges/">edges</a> in a series of blog posts from Thomas Lin Pedersen.</p>
<p>This example arranges the nodes (hosts) circularly (plot A) and a straight line (B) and sizes them by the number of connections to other hosts. Each line (edge) represents a co-hosting relationship.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>g1 &lt;- ggraph(
  graph = relay_graph,
  layout = &quot;linear&quot;,
  circular = TRUE
) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = connections)) +
  geom_edge_arc() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)

g2 &lt;- ggraph(
  graph = relay_graph,
  layout = &quot;linear&quot;
) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = connections)) +
  geom_edge_arc() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)

plot_grid(g1, g2, labels = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-02-14-relayverse_files/figure-html/ggraph-arc-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This example arranges the nodes (hosts) according to an algorithm specified by the <code>layout</code> argument to <code>ggraph()</code> and sizes them by the number of connections to other hosts. Each line (edge) represents a co-hosting relationship and multiple connections are shown separately by ‘fanning’ them out (hence the <code>geom_edge_fan()</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggraph(graph = relay_graph, layout = &quot;nicely&quot;) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(size = connections)) +
  geom_edge_fan() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-02-14-relayverse_files/figure-html/ggraph-fan-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I haven’t added labels on the nodes nor the points because of the visual clutter it creates for this particular example. You could use <code>geom_node_text()</code> to add node labels and something like <code>aes(label = &lt;column_name&gt;)</code> in your edge geom to label the connections.</p>
<p>This is where interactive network graphs come in handy, as you can zoom, pan and hover to get more info.</p>

<div id="interactive-with-visnetwork" class="section level2">
<h2>Interactive with <code>visNetwork</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/">The <code>visNetwork</code> package</a> wraps <a href="http://visjs.org">the <code>vis.js</code> library</a> to make interactive network graphs. Its <code>visNetwork()</code> function takes separate data frames of edges and nodes that are in <a href="https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/nodes.html">a pre-specified format</a>, so we won’t be able to use our tidygraph object for this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Dataframe of unique nodes with an ID value
nodes &lt;- shows_clean %&gt;%  # take our podcast-host dataset
  distinct(Hosts) %&gt;%  # get column of unique hosts
  arrange(Hosts) %&gt;%  # alphabetical order
  mutate(id = as.character(row_number()), label = Hosts) %&gt;% 
  select(-Hosts) #%&gt;%  # provides pop up value on viz

  left_join(nodes, by = c(&quot;V2&quot; = &quot;label&quot;)) %&gt;%
  rename(from = id.x, to = id.y, title = Podcast)</code></pre>
<p>Now we plug the data into the <code>visNetwork()</code> function and pipe this into some other other functions to set some options. It’s quite a lot of code, but the piping into other <code>vis*()</code> functions breaks it up into more manageable chunks.</p>
<p>And out pops the visualisation! You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the navigation buttons or your trackpad/mouse to navigate the network</li>
<li>click a node to highlight a host and their co-hosts (single hosts loop back to themselves)</li>
<li>hover over an edge to show a label with the show name</li>
<li>select a host from the dropdown menu to highlight them and their co-hosts</li>
<li>click and drag a node to move it</li>

<p>I recommend you <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/output/relayverse.html">view the network in its own window</a>.</p>
<p>Some design points:</p>
<ul>
<li>the nodes are microphone icons from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a></li>
<li>the edges are the same colour as the right-hand circle on the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/rd">Reconcilable Differences</a> artwork (with 50 per cent transparency)</li>
<li>on highlight, the edge colour is the same as for the left-hand circle on the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/rd">Reconcilable Differences</a> artwork (with 50 per cent transparency)</li>
<li>when selecting a node, the edges increase in thickness to show first order interactions, stay the same for second order interactions, while the rest are greyed out</li>
<li>the font face should appear as the monospace Lekton, which matches this blog</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very simple example, but <a href="https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/">lots of other <code>visNetwork</code> options are available</a>.</p>

<h1>What now?</h1>
<p>This was really just an introduction to <code>tidygraph</code>, <code>ggraph</code> and <code>visNetwork</code>. These packages make network analysis a little more consistent and can provide some interesting stats and visuals very quickly. A next step might be to produce a ‘network of podcast networks’, since Relay FM hosts appear in shows on other networks as well.</p>
