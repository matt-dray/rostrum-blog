<h1>Podcast networks</h1>
<p>Podcasting is becoming big business. Music-streaming giant <a href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/">Spotify</a> <a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2019/Spotify-Announces-Strategic-Acquisitions-to-Accelerate-Growth-in-Podcasting/default.aspx">just acquired</a> the podcast network <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/">Gimlet</a> for <a href="https://www.recode.net/2019/2/1/18207198/spotify-gimlet-podcast-acquisition">a reported $200 million</a>.</p>
<p>Other networks include <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/">The Incomparable</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a> and <a href="https://www.radiotopia.fm/">Radiotopia</a>. Such networks can boost revenue and listener numbers and provide access to expertise, management and resources.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a> is a network that focuses largely on tech content. It was started by <a href="https//www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley">Myke Hurley</a> and <a href="https//www.relay.fm/people/stephenhackett">Stephen Hackett</a> in 2014 and you can find a list of <a href="https://www.relay.fm/shows">shows</a> and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/people">personnel</a> on their site. Many of Relay FM’s hosts have hosted more than one podcast within the network. What do the relationships between them look like?</p>
<p>This post is about preparing and visualising the ‘Relayverse’ using the R packages <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/"><code>tidygraph</code> for network data handling</a> and <a href="https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/ggraph.html"><code>ggraph</code> for network visualisation</a> (both by <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasp85">Thomas Lin Pedersen</a>), along with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/visNetwork/vignettes/Introduction-to-visNetwork.html">the <code>visNetwork</code> package</a> (from Benoit Thieurmel and Titouan Robert of <a href="http://www.datastorm.fr/">Datastorm</a>, wrapping <a href="http://visjs.org">Almende BV’s <code>vis.js</code> library</a>) for interactive visualisation.</p>

<h1>Tidygraph</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/">tidygraph package</a> was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasp85">Thomas Lin Pedersen</a> and ‘is an entry into <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">the tidyverse</a> that provides a tidy framework for all things relational (networks/graphs, trees, etc)’.</p>
<p>To use the package, we need every host combination<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> for each podcast, which can be achieved with the <code>combn()</code> function. This gives us a pair of points (‘nodes’ in graph-speak) that can be connected by a line (an ‘edge’) to indicate their relationship.</p>
<p>But a show with one host doesn’t have a pair of points, so I’m going to duplicate these rows first. If we don’t do this, we can’t plot these shows because they won’t have a connection between two nodes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Isolate the shows with one host 
solo_vec &lt;- shows_clean %&gt;%
  count(Podcast) %&gt;%
  filter(n == 1) %&gt;%
  pull(Podcast)

# Filter the show-host dataframe by solo-hosted podcasts
solo_df &lt;- filter(shows_clean, Podcast %in% solo_vec)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can bind these rows and get our host combinations.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Prepare host combinations per show
relay_combos &lt;- shows_clean %&gt;%
  bind_rows(solo_df) %&gt;%  # to duplicate the shows with solo hosts
  group_by(Podcast) %&gt;%  # operate within each podcast
  split(.$Podcast) %&gt;%  # split on podcast
  map(., 2) %&gt;%  # gets vector of hosts per podcast list element
  map(~combn(.x, m = 2)) %&gt;%   # all pair combiantions
  map(~t(.x)) %&gt;%  # transpose the matrix
  map(as_tibble) %&gt;%  # convert to a tibble dataframe
  bind_rows(.id = &quot;Podcast&quot;) %&gt;%  # list-element name to column
  select(V1, V2, Podcast)

sample_n(relay_combos, 10) %&gt;% knitr::kable()  # random sample of 10</code></pre>

<p>We can turn this dataframe of host-pair combinations into a tidygraph object with the <code>as_tbl_graph()</code> function. This class of object contains two dataframes (the nodes and the edges) and some metadata.</p>
<p>We can also use functions from the <code>tidygraph</code> package to help calculate various network statistics. For example, the <code>centrality_degree()</code> function tells us the nodes with the most connections. We can add this as a column in our node data and use this later to do things like resize nodes depending on their centrality.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>relay_graph &lt;- as_tbl_graph(relay_combos, directed = FALSE)%&gt;% 
  mutate(connections = centrality_degree()) %&gt;%  # number of connections
  arrange(desc(connections))  # order by number of shows

print(relay_graph)  </code></pre>

<h1>Visualisation</h1>
<div id="static-with-ggraph" class="section level2">
<h2>Static with <code>ggraph</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/ggraph.html">The <code>ggraph</code> package</a> was designed to work seamlessly with <code>tidygraph</code> objects and the <code>ggplot2</code> plotting package. You simply pass your <code>tidygraph</code> object to <code>ggraph</code>‘s ’graph’ argument. Below are a couple of examples for demonstration purposes that show you just a handful of options. You can learn more about <code>ggraph</code>’s <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-layouts/">layouts</a>, <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-nodes/">nodes</a> and <a href="https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-edges/">edges</a> in a series of blog posts from Thomas Lin Pedersen.</p>
<p>This example arranges the nodes (hosts) circularly (plot A) and a straight line (B) and sizes them by the number of connections to other hosts. Each line (edge) represents a co-hosting relationship.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>g1 &lt;- ggraph(
  graph = relay_graph,
  layout = &quot;linear&quot;,
  circular = TRUE
) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = connections)) +
  geom_edge_arc() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)

g2 &lt;- ggraph(
  graph = relay_graph,
  layout = &quot;linear&quot;
) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = connections)) +
  geom_edge_arc() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)

plot_grid(g1, g2, labels = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-02-14-relayverse_files/figure-html/ggraph-arc-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This example arranges the nodes (hosts) according to an algorithm specified by the <code>layout</code> argument to <code>ggraph()</code> and sizes them by the number of connections to other hosts. Each line (edge) represents a co-hosting relationship and multiple connections are shown separately by ‘fanning’ them out (hence the <code>geom_edge_fan()</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggraph(graph = relay_graph, layout = &quot;nicely&quot;) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(size = connections)) +
  geom_edge_fan() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-02-14-relayverse_files/figure-html/ggraph-fan-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I haven’t added labels on the nodes nor the points because of the visual clutter it creates for this particular example. You could use <code>geom_node_text()</code> to add node labels and something like <code>aes(label = &lt;column_name&gt;)</code> in your edge geom to label the connections.</p>
<p>This is where interactive network graphs come in handy, as you can zoom, pan and hover to get more info.</p>

<h2>Interactive with <code>visNetwork</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/">The <code>visNetwork</code> package</a> wraps <a href="http://visjs.org">the <code>vis.js</code> library</a> to make interactive network graphs. Its <code>visNetwork()</code> function takes separate dataframes of edges and nodes that are in <a href="https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/nodes.html">a pre-specified format</a>, so we won’t be able to use our tidygraph obejct for this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Dataframe of unique nodes with an ID value

<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the navigation buttons or your trackpad/mouse to navigate the network</li>
<li>click a node to highlight a host and their co-hosts</li>
<li>hover over an edge to show a label with the show name</li>
<li>select a host from the dropdown menu to highlight them and their co-hosts</li>
<li>click and drag a node to move it</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very simple example, but <a href="https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/">lots of other <code>visNetwork</code> options are available</a>.</p>
