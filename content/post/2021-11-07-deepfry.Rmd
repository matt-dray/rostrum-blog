# tl;dr

Now you can use a function to deep fry memes in R.

# Extra crispy

You can make memes in R with [packages like Guangchang Yu's {meme}](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/meme/). You could even post them to Twitter with #RStatsMemes for [\@rstatsmemes](https://twitter.com/rstatsmemes) to find.

However, it's no longer enough to present memes as-is. They must be deep-fried to become [modern and ironic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme#Irony_and_absurdism). It will help people think that your meme is so edgy that it's been re-saved thousands of times.

# Get to temperature

You'll need image-manipulation wizardry from [the {magick} package](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/index.html), along with [{extrafont}](https://github.com/wch/extrafont) to let you use fonts from your system.

At time of writing there is an issue with importing fonts, which [requires an earlier version of {Rttf2pt1} to be installed](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68642855).

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("magick", "extrafont", "remotes"))
remotes::install_version("Rttf2pt1", version = "1.3.8")
```

You can then import fonts from your system.

```{r eval=FALSE}
extrafont::font_import()
```

Now we can use important joke fonts---like Impact, Papyrus or Calibri---in our memes.

# Small fry

I've cooked up a single, low-quality function, `fry()`, that:

1. Reads a meme template image (or any image) from a path
1. Adds top/bottom text in Impact font
1. Reads from a URL a specific (cursed) cry/laugh emoji that's popular in deep-frying and places it in a random location (corners or left/right sides)
1. Adjusts the image contrast, saturation, etc,[^adjust], tints it orange and bulges it from the centre
1. Writes the image to a temporary jpeg file---compressing it horribly---and then reads it back in
1. Outputs a `magick-image` object that you can save with `magick::image_write()` and send to all your friend (sic)

It does what I want it to do; adjust it as you please.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(magick))

fry <- function(
  img_path, emoji_path,
  text_top, text_bottom,
  depth = c("shallow", "deep")) {
  
  depth <- match.arg(depth)
  
  cat("Heating oil... ")
  
  emoji <- magick::image_read(emoji_path)
  
  emoji_where <-  sample(c(  
    paste0("north", c("east", "west")),
    paste0("south", c("east", "west")),
    "east", "west"  # e.g. 'east' is right
  ), 1)
  
  img <- image_read(img_path) |> 
    image_annotate(
      text_top, "north", size = 80, font = "Impact",
      color = "white", strokecolor = "black"
    ) |>
    image_annotate(
      text_bottom, "south", size = 80, font = "Impact",
      color = "white", strokecolor = "black"
    ) |>
    image_scale("1000") |> 
    image_composite(emoji, gravity = emoji_where) |> 
    image_colorize(30, "orange") |>  # tint
    image_modulate(brightness = 80, saturation = 120, hue = 90) |>
    image_contrast(sharpen = 100) |> 
    image_noise()
  
  cat("dunking meme... ")
  
  if (depth == "shallow") {
    img <- img %>% image_implode(-0.5)  # bulge
    compress <- 8
  } else if (depth == "deep") {
    img <- img %>% image_implode(-1)  # more bulge
    compress <- 1  # maximum compression
  } 
  
  path_out <- tempfile("meme", fileext = ".jpeg")
  image_write(img, path_out, "jpeg", compress)
  
  cat("crisp.")
  image_read(path_out)
  
}
```

# Get cooking

What spicy meme shall I make? Well, the `=` versus `<-` assignment-operator flamewar has been cold for a few days, so time to heat it up again.[^flamewar] And why not incorporate the world's most famous fry cook (in sarcastic form)?

```{r}
sponge_path <- paste0(  # URL to meme image
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/",
  "master/static/post/2021-11-07-deepfry_files/spongebob.jpg"
)

emoji_path <- paste0(  # URL to cry/laugh emoji
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/",
  "master/static/post/2021-11-07-deepfry_files/deepfry-emoji.jpg"
)

bot_txt <- "= sAvEs KeYsTrOkEs Vs <-"  # sarcastic text
top_txt <- tolower(bot_txt)
```

First, a nice shallow fry.

```{r shallow-fry, fig.alt="A deep-fried meme image, which has been compressed, has an orange tint and includes a cry-laugh emoji. It is less compressed than the next image. The meme is of sarcastic Spongebob, with the same text on the top and bottom, but the lower text has alternating case. It says 'equals-sign saves keystrokes versus assignment-arrow'."}
fry(sponge_path, emoji_path, top_txt, bot_txt, "shallow")
```

And now we _deep_ fry.

```{r deep-fry, fig.alt="A deep-fried meme image, which has been compressed, has an orange tint and includes a cry-laugh emoji. It is more compressed than the image above. The meme is of sarcastic Spongebob, with the same text on the top and bottom, but the lower text has alternating case. It says 'equals-sign saves keystrokes versus assignment-arrow'."}
fry(sponge_path, emoji_path, top_txt, bot_txt, "deep")
```

\*Fry-cook's kiss\*

[^adjust]: Did I arrive at these settings scientifically? Yes, they were the ones that made me laugh when I saw the resulting output.
[^flamewar]: I have written before about this very serious topic. [I developed a method to detect `=` for assignment without you having to open a script that contains it](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/03/13/assign/).

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# make the gif at the top of this post

sponge_fried <- 
  fry(sponge_path, emoji_path, top_txt, bot_txt, "deep")

sponge_unfried <- image_read(sponge_path) |> 
  image_annotate(
    top_txt, "north", size = 80, font = "Impact",
    color = "white", strokecolor = "black"
  ) |>
  image_annotate(
    bot_txt, "south", size = 80, font = "Impact",
    color = "white", strokecolor = "black"
  ) |>
  image_scale("1000")

c(sponge_unfried, sponge_fried) %>%
  image_morph() %>%
  image_animate(fps = 5, optimize = TRUE) |> 
  image_write("~/Desktop/spongebob-frypants.gif")
```
