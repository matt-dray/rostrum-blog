# tl;dr

Run `ghd_copy()` from [the {ghdump} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/ghdump){target='_blank'} to either clone or download all the GitHub repositories for a given user. Intended for archival purposes or setting up a new computer.

The package comes with no guarantees and will likely be in a perpetual work-in-progress state. Please [submit issues](https://github.com/matt-dray/ghdump/issues){target='_blank'} or pull requests.

# Clone army

Situation: 

* Sometimes I get a new computer and want to clone all my repos to it
* Sometimes I want to be able to archive my repos so I'm not dependent on GitHub nor any given computer
* it would be tedious to download or clone the repos one-by-one from the GitHub interface

Wants:

* To clone (with HTTPS or SSH) or download all of my repos with one command
* Be able to unzip downloaded repos en masse if I want to
* Do all this from within R, mostly for the learning experience, but also to allow for user interactivity

Observations:

* I don't know of a specific R function that automates mass-downloading or mass-cloning of GitHub repos
* [the {gh} package](https://github.com/r-lib/gh){target='_blank'} provides a lightweight [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/){target='_blank'} wrapper for R that's likely to be helpful
* R has many file-handling functions that will be helpful

# {ghdump}

The result is that I wrote a function, `ghd_copy()`, that copies (clones or downloads) all the repos for a given user to a specified location. You can get it in [the tiny {ghdump} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/ghdump){target='_blank'}.

The function interacts with the GitHub API thanks to [the {gh} package](https://github.com/r-lib/gh){target='_blank'} by Gábor Csárdi, Jenny Bryan and Hadley Wickham, while iterating over repos comes thanks to [the {purrr} package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/){target='_blank'} by Lionel Henry and Hadley Wickham.

<div class="tip"> `r fontawesome::fa("exclamation-circle")` <b>Update</b>

As of May 2022 there's also [a handy rOpenSci package called {gitcellar}](https://docs.ropensci.org/gitcellar/), by Maëlle Salmon and Jeroen Ooms, which is for downloading an organisation's repos for archival purposes.

## Get and use

Install with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/ghdump")
```

To use the package, you'll need a GitHub account and [a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) stored in your .Renviron file](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html). You can do this with the following steps:

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::browse_github_pat()  # opens browser to generate token
usethis::edit_r_environ()     # add your token to the .Renviron
# then restart R
```

You can use {ghdump} to download the repos for a specified user:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ghdump::ghd_copy(
  gh_user = "matt-dray",           # download repos for this user
  dest_dir = "~/Documents/repos",  # full local file path to copy to
  copy_type = "download"           # "download" or "clone" the repos
)
```

Or clone them:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ghdump::ghd_copy(
  gh_user = "matt-dray",
  dest_dir = "~/Documents/repos"
  copy_type = "clone",
  protocol = "https" # specify "https" or "ssh"
)
```

If you want to use the SSH protocol when cloning, you need to make sure that you've [set up your keys](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html).

## Interactivity

My expectation is to use `ghd_copy()` infrequently and in a non-programmatic way, so I've made it quite interactive. This means user input is required; you'll get some yes/no questions in the console that will affect how the function runs.

Here's an imaginary demo of the output from `ghd_copy()` when `copy_type = "download"`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
> ghd_copy("made-up-user", "~/Desktop/test-download", "download")
Fetching GitHub repos for user made-up-user... 3 repos found
Create new directory at path ~/Desktop/test-download? y/n: y
Definitely download all 3 repos? y/n: y
Downloading zipped repositories to ~/Desktop/test-download

trying URL 'https://github.com/made-up-user/fake-repo-1/archive/master.zip'
Content type 'application/zip' length 100 bytes
==================================================
downloaded 100 bytes

trying URL 'https://github.com/made-up-user/fake-repo-2/archive/master.zip'
Content type 'application/zip' length 100 bytes
==================================================
downloaded 100 bytes

trying URL 'https://github.com/made-up-user/fake-repo-3/archive/master.zip'
Content type 'application/zip' length 100 bytes
==================================================

Unzip all folders? y/n: y
Unzipping repositories
Retain the zip files? y/n: y
Keeping zipped folders.
Remove '-master' suffix from unzipped directory names? y/n: y
Renaming files to remove '-master' suffix
Finished downloading
```

And now imaginary demo of the output from `ghd_copy()` when `copy_type = "clone"`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
> ghd_copy("made-up-user", "~/Desktop/test-clone", "clone", "ssh")
Fetching GitHub repos for user made-up-user... 3 repos found
Create new directory at path ~/Desktop/test-clone? y/n: y
Definitely clone all 3 repos? y/n: y
Cloning repositories to ~/Desktop/test-clone 
Cloning into 'fake-repo-1'...
Cloning into 'fake-repo-2'...
Cloning into 'fake-repo-3'...
Finished cloning
```

Note that cloning has only been tested on my own Mac OS machine at this point (June 2020) and is not guaranteed to work elsewhere yet. Please [submit issues](https://github.com/matt-dray/ghdump/issues){target='_blank'} or pull requests to help improve this.

## Under the hood

What are the steps to downloading repos with `ghdump::ghd_copy()`?

First, to get repo info:

1. `ghdump:::ghd_get_repos()` passes a GitHub username to `gh::gh()`, which contacts the GitHub API to return a gh_response object that contains info about each of that user's repos
1. `ghdump:::ghd_extract_names()` takes the gh_response object from `ghd_get_repos()` and extracts the names into a character vector

Then to download (if `copy_type = "download"`):

1. `ghdump:::ghd_enframe_urls()` turns the character vector of repo names into a data.frame, with a corresponding column that contains the URL to a zip file for that repo
1. `ghdump:::ghd_copy_zips()` takes each zip file URL from that data frame and downloads them to the file path provided by the user
1. `ghdump:::ghd_unzip()` unzips the zipped repos

You can, of course, use these intermediate functions if you have slightly different needs. Maybe you want to limit the repos that are downloaded; do this by filtering the vector output from `ghdump:::ghd_extract_names()` for example.

Or to clone (if `copy_type = "clone"`):

1. `ghdump:::ghd_clone_multi()` that iterates cloning over the repos, itself calling `ghdump:::ghd_clone_one()`

# Why bother?

What did I learn from doing this?

## Iteration

Aside from {gh}, the package also depends on {purrr} for iterative programming. 

For example, the gh_response object output from `ghdump:::ghd_get_repos()` is passed to `map()` with the `pluck()` function to extract the repo names. 

Another example is the use of `walk()`, which is like `map()`, except we use it when the output is some 'side effect'. By 'side effect', we mean that it doesn't return an R object. For example, we can `walk()` the `unzip()` function over the path to each zip file. This doesn't return anything in R; it results in some local files being manipulated.

## File manipulation

R can be used to interact with files on your computer. There's a number of these base R functions in the package:

* `dir.create()` to create a new folder
* `file.remove()` to remove a file or folder
* `list.files()` and `list.dirs()` to return a character vector files and folders at some path
* `file.rename` to change the name of a file or folder
* `unzip()` to unpack a zipped folder

## User input

How do you ask questions of your user and get answers? This interactivity is made possible by `readline()`. You pass it a string to prompt the user, whose return value can be stored. 

For example, this is how it looks in the console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
> answer <- readline("Do you like pizza? ") 
Do you like pizza? yes
> answer
[1] "yes"
```

Where a user has written `yes` after the prompt on the second line.

## Stickers

I've designed a few hex stickers with the {hexSticker} package; you can see them in [my 'stickers' GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/stickers){target='_blank'}. This time I made the sticker for {ghdump} using Dmytro Perepolkin's [{bunny}](https://github.com/dmi3kno/bunny){target='_blank'} package, which is a helper for the [{magick} package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html){target='_blank'} from Jeroen Ooms. It's [a very smooth process](https://www.ddrive.no/post/making-hex-and-twittercard-with-bunny-and-magick/){target='_blank'} with much flexibility.

# This belongs in a dump

Yeah, maybe. It's not sophisticated, but I've found it useful for my own specific purposes.
