# tl;dr

Run `ghd_download()` from [the {ghdump} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/ghdump){target='_blank'} to download all the GitHub repositories for a given user.

The package comes with no guarantees and will likely be in a perpetual work-in-progress state.

# Where's that repo?

Situation: 

* I work across different computers and don't always have copies of all my repositories
* I sometimes want to be able to archive my repos so I'm not dependent on GitHub nor any given computer
* it would be tedious to download or clone the repos one-by-one from the GitHub interface

Need:

* to download all of my repos with one command
* to sometimes keep them zipped, sometimes unzip them
* do this from within R, mostly for the learning experience, but also to allow for user interactivity

Observations:

* I don't know of a specific R function that automates mass-downloading of GitHub repos
* [the {gh} package](https://github.com/r-lib/gh){target='_blank'} provides a lightweight [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/){target='_blank'} wrapper for R that's likely to be helpful
* R has many file-handling functions

# {ghdump}

The result is that I wrote a function that downloads all the repos for a given user to a specified location. You can get it in [the tiny {ghdump} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/ghdump){target='_blank'}.

## Get and use

Install with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/ghdump")
```

And use it like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ghdump::ghd_download(
  gh_user = "matt-dray",     # GitHub user to download repos from
  dir = "~/Documents/repos"  # where to download to locally
)
```

This assumes you have a GitHub account and a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) stored in your .Renviron file. You can do this with the following steps:

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::browse_github_pat()  # opens browser to generate token
usethis::edit_r_environ()     # add your token to the .Renviron
```

See the [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html){target='_blank'} book by Jenny Bryan, the STAT 545 TAs and Jim Hester for more info on this.

## Interactivity

My expectation is to use `ghd_download()` infrequently and in a non-programmatic way, so I've made it quite interactive. This means user input is required; you'll get some yes/no questions in the console that will affect how the function runs.

Here's an imaginary demo of the output from `ghd_download()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ghdump::ghd_download("made-up-user", "~/Documents/repos")
## Fetching GitHub repos for user made-up-user 
## 3 repos found
## Create new directory at path ~/Documents/repos? y/n: y
## Download all 3 repos? y/n: y
## Downloading zipped repositories to ~/Documents/<directory> 
## trying URL 'https://github.com/made-up-user/repo1/archive/master.zip'
## trying URL 'https://github.com/made-up-user/repo2/archive/master.zip'
## trying URL 'https://github.com/made-up-user/repo3/archive/master.zip'
## Unzip all folders? y/n: y
## Unzipping repositories
## Retain the zip files? y/n: y
## Keeping zipped folders.
## Remove '-master' suffix from unzipped directory names? y/n: y
## Renaming files to remove '-master' suffix
## Finished
```

## Under the hood

What are the steps to downloading repos? There are five (non-exported) functions in {gh} that are called by `ghd_download()`:

1. `ghdump:::ghd_get_repos()` passes a GitHub username to `gh::gh()`, which contacts the GitHub API to return a gh_response object that contains info about each of that user's repos
1. `ghdump:::ghd_extract_names()` takes the gh_response object from `ghd_get_repos()` and extracts the names into a character vector
1. `ghdump:::ghd_enframe_urls()` turns that character vector of repo names into a data.frame, with a corresponding column that contains the URL to a zip file for that repo
1. `ghdump:::ghd_download_zips()` takes each zip file URL from that data frame and downloads them to the file path provided by the user
1. `ghdump:::ghd_unzip()` unzips the zipped repos

You can, of course, use these intermediate functions if you have slightly different needs. Maybe you want to limit the repos that are downloaded; do this by filtering the vector output from `ghdump:::ghd_extract_names()` for example.

# Why bother?

What did I learn from doing this?

## Iteration

Aside from {gh}, the package also depends on {purrr} for iterative programming. 

For example, the gh_response object output from `ghdump:::ghd_get_repos()` is passed to `map()` with the `pluck()` function to extract the repo names. 

Another example is the use of `walk()`, which is like `map()`, except we use it when the output is some 'side effect'. By 'side effect', we mean that it doesn't return an R object. For example, we can `walk()` the `unzip()` function over the path to each zip file. This doesn't return anything in R; it results in file manipulation.

## File manipulation

There's a number of file-manipulation functions from base R used in this package as well:

* `dir.create()` to create a new folder
* `file.remove()` to remove a file or folder
* `list.files()` and `list.dirs()` to return a character vector files and folders at some path
* `file.rename` to change the name of a file or folder
* `unzip()` to unpack a zipped folder

## User input

And the interactive use is made possible by `readline()`. You pass it a string to prompt the user, whose return value can be stored. For example, this is how it looks in the console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
> answer <- readline("Do you like pizza? ") 
Do you like pizza? yes
> answer
[1] "yes"
```

Where a user has written `yes` after the prompt on the second line.

# This belongs in a dump

Yeah, maybe. It's not sophisticated, but I've found it useful for my own specific purpose.
