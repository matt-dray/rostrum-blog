# Happy first birthday `r emo::ji("tada")`

## One year, visualised

There's been [27 posts](https://www.rostrum.blog/) on rostrum.blog in its first year, so about one every two weeks. 

This interactive graphic shows the publishing frequency, where each dot is a post and the x-axis is time. Turn your mobile to landscape mode to see it in full.

```{r run, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=1}
# The data for the plot was scraped using {rvest} and visualised
# with {ggplot2} and {plotly}.

# Load packages
library(dplyr)  # data manipulation
library(rvest)  # web scrape
library(stringr)  # string manipulation
library(lubridate)  # deal with dates
library(ggplot2)  # plots
library(plotly)  # interactive plots

# Scrape the rostrum.blog home page
html <- read_html("https://rostrum.blog/")  # the site's homepage lists the posts

# Extract the post titles
title <- html %>%
  html_nodes(".archive-item-link") %>%  # node identified with SelectorGadget 
  html_text()  # extract the text from the node

# Extract the post dates
date <- html %>%
  html_nodes(".archive-item-date") %>%  # element with the data we care about
  html_text() %>%  # convert to text
  str_replace_all("\n|[:space:]", "")  # replace newline-space with blank

# Dataframe of titles and dates
posts <- tibble(title = title, publish_date = date) %>% 
  mutate(publish_date = ymd(date)) %>%  # make column datetime
  arrange(publish_date) %>%  # order by date
  filter(publish_date < "2019-04-14")  # only posts before this one

# Create plot object
p <- posts %>%
  mutate(count = 1) %>%   # dummy to indicate a post was made
  ggplot(aes(x = publish_date, y = count, label = title)) +
  geom_point(color = "#1D8016") +  # match the rostrum.blog green
  theme_void() +  # strip plot elements
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())  # to stop plotly rendering grid

# Object telling {plotly} not to do axes, etc 
ax <- list(
  title = "",
  zeroline = FALSE,
  showline = FALSE,
  showticklabels = FALSE,
  showgrid = FALSE
)

#Pass the plot object to plotly (actually performed outside this code chunk)
ggplotly(
  p,  # plot object
  tooltip = c("publish_date", "title")  # add mousover info
) %>%
  layout(xaxis = ax, yaxis = ax) %>%  # remove axes
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)  # don't show plotly toolbar
