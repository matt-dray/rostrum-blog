# tl;dr

What if public sector data scientists simply... shared the tools they make?

# An axe to grind

I'm speaking today at an event for UK government data scientists with the theme 'the data science toolshed'. My plea is small: I want public sector workers to share the tools they make.

We should build modular things like R packages that are easy to use and develop; make them available to everyone to minimise duplication and encourage collaboration; and maximise reach by telling everyone about it. This is how we improve quality and build our community. And save money for the taxpayer. 

Handily, this is already expressed in the government's [Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice):

> Share, reuse and collaborate: avoid duplicating effort and unnecessary costs by collaborating across government and sharing and reusing technology, data, and services.

I've had a small experience with this: I made [the {a11ytables} R package](https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/) to help producers of stats publications create best-practice, accessible spreadsheets using R. It's now being used across the public sector and is referenced from [the government's best-practice guidance](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/further-resources-for-releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/).

Success? Yes. But also PANIK. I've left the organisation where I made it, so maintenance is trickier without GitHub admin privileges. I worry that I should have thought about this sooner, that I should fork and update it, that updating users will be hard and that links to the old package will break. 

The earlier you consider future issues, the better.

# Burying the hatchet

So I volunteered to run my own talk therapy, basically. Maybe someone else can learn from it.

The slides are live [on the internet](https://matt-dray.github.io/government-toolshed/) and embedded below, or you can view [the source on GitHub](https://matt-dray.github.io/government-toolshed/#/section-1). Press 's' to pop out the speaker notes.

The slides were made with [Revealjs via Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/), because of course they were.

# Clamp down

So I vouch for sustainabilising (not a word), centralising and advertising the useful things you make. Maybe we could have a list or store of tools we've produced collectively? Something like [an 'Awesome' list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) or a [CRAN task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/). Maybe that would make it easier to find and develop existing solutions instead of building from scratch all the time.

Build a toolshed. They will come?
