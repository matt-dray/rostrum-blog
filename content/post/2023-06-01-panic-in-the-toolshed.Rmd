# tl;dr

What if public sector data scientists simply... shared their hard work?

# In the toolshed

I'm speaking today at a cross-government data-science event called 'the data science toolshed'. My plea is very small. I want public sector workers to:

1. Sustainabilise
1. Centralise
1. Advertise

In short, build modular tools like R packages that are easier to use and develop; make them available to everyone to minimise duplication and encourage collaboration; and make sure to tell everyone about it to maximise reach. This is how we improve quality and build our community. And save money for the taxpayer. 

I've got some experience in this field: I made [the {a11ytables} R package](https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/) to help producers of stats publications create best-practice, accessible spreadsheets using R. After I made it, I didn't shut up about it, and now it's being used across the public sector.

Success? Yes. But also PANIK. I've:

* left the org where I wrote the package and no longer have full admin permissions
* not tried to transfer the repo to a more central location, like the Office for National Statistics's [best-practice-and-impact](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact) GitHub org (it might add pressure on them to ensure it's 'good enough' and that they can keep it up to date in my absence)
* considered updating from {openxlsx} to {openxlsx2} under the hood, but I'm not sure if I should update {a11ytables}, or fork {a11ytables2} and go back to users all over again to tell them to upgrade?

So I volunteered for my own talk therapy so I could explain my success and predicaments with the wider data science network.

Regardless, I vouch for sustainabilising, centralising and advertising the useful things you make. Maybe we could have a centralised list or store of tools we've produced collectively? Maybe that would make it easier to find and develop existing solutions instead of building from scratch all the time.

Build a toolshed. They will come?
