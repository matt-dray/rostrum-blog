<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/wc18-age">an R Shiny app</a> that tells you how many players at World Cup 2018 were younger than you. It’s designed to make you feel old. You’re welcome.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-world-cup-final" class="section level1">
<h1>The World Cup Final</h1>
<p>So the World Cup is over for another year.</p>
<p>I managed luckily to get tickets for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_CONIFA_World_Football_Cup">the final</a>, where <a href="http://www.conifa.org/en/members/karpatalya/">Karpatlya</a>—a Hungarian diaspora in Ukraine—overcame the powerful <a href="http://www.conifa.org/en/members/northern-cyprus/">Northern Cyprus</a> team on penalties at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Enfield, London.</p>

Extremely rare and valuable tickets for the (CONIFA) World Cup final

</div>
<p>Another successful tournament from the <a href="http://www.conifa.org/en/about-us/">Confederation of Independent Football Associations</a> (CONIFA).</p>
</div>
<div id="it-didnt-come-home" class="section level1">
<h1>It didn’t come home</h1>
<p>Oh and also the far-less popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> has also finished.</p>
<p>Wonderkid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9">Kylian Mbappé</a> picked up the young player of the tournament as France lifted the trophy for the second time in their history.</p>
<p>Yes, 19-year-old Mbappé is young enough to have been born <em>after</em> France’s last World Cup win in 1998. That makes me feel old.</p>
<p>It seems only yesterday that I was dreaming of starting alongside hall-of-famer Bermudan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Goater">Shaun Goater</a> in the extremely successful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_Manchester_City_F.C._season">Manchester City squad</a> at the turn of the millennium.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (That reference probably dates me quite well.)</p>
<p>Obviously I can still make it as an elite footballer. Right? What better way to find out than to build an app with <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">R Shiny</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-app" class="section level1">
<h1>The app</h1>
<p>You can clone <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/wc18-age">the GitHub repo</a> and run the app,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> or from an active R session you can run the following to download and run it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>shiny::runGitHub(&quot;wc18-age&quot;, &quot;matt-dray&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The app depends on the packages {shiny}, {shinythemes} and {DT}. I used the data set in the <a href="https://github.com/AllezCannes/WorldCupSquads">AllezCannes/WorldCupSquads</a> GitHub repo, which contains player data scraped from Wikipedia by user <a href="https://github.com/philstraforelli">philstraforelli</a>.</p>
<p>The app asks merely for your birth date—selectable from the dropdown menu—and calculates the number and percentage of players younger than you, with an interactive table that lists who they are.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/post/2018-07-17-how-many-world-cup-footballers-were-younger-than-you_files/wc18.png" alt="A preview of the app, showing date of birth input, some text with calculation of your age and a table with the footballers who were younger than you." width='100%'/></p>
</div>
<p>A colleague suggested that wasn’t enough punishment. So I updated it to tell you how many of the players you could be parent to (assuming you had them when you were age 18).</p>
<p>Here’s some solid reviews I’ve received so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very depressing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I knew I was too old to become a great footballer</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Just what I needed to see</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enjoy! And take inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuyoshi_Miura">Kazuyoshi ‘King Kazu’ Miura</a>, a Japanese 51-year-old (born 1967) who is still playing at time of writing. He’s apparently just <a href="https://twitter.com/yokhin/status/1020981764276260864?s=21">played a match for Yokohama FC alongside 16-year-old Koki Saito</a> (born 2001), who in theory is young enough to be his grandson!</p>
