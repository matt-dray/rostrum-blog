# tl;dr

I wrote [an R Shiny app](https://github.com/matt-dray/wc18-age) that tells you how many players at World Cup 2018 were younger than you. It's designed to make you feel old. You're welcome.

# The World Cup Final

So the World Cup is over for another year. 

I managed luckily to get tickets for [the final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_CONIFA_World_Football_Cup), where [Karpatlya](http://www.conifa.org/en/members/karpatalya/)---a Hungarian diaspora in Ukraine---overcame the powerful [Northern Cyprus](http://www.conifa.org/en/members/northern-cyprus/) team on penalties at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Enfield, London.

Another successful tournament from the [Confederation of Independent Football Associations](http://www.conifa.org/en/about-us/) (CONIFA).

# It didn't come home

Oh and also the far-less popular [FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup) has also finished.

Wonderkid [Kylian Mbappé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9) picked up the young player of the tournament as France lifted the trophy for the second time in their history.

Yes, 19-year-old Mbappé is young enough to have been born _after_ France's last World Cup win in 1998. That makes me feel old.

It seems only yesterday that I was dreaming of starting alongside hall-of-famer Bermudan [Shaun Goater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Goater) in the extremely successful [Manchester City squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_Manchester_City_F.C._season) at the turn of the millennium.[^div1] (That reference probably dates me quite well.)

Obviously I can still make it as an elite footballer. Right? What better way to find out than to build an app with [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).

# The app

You can clone [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/wc18-age) and run the app,[^shinyapps] or from an active R session you can run the following to download and run it:

```{r eval=FALSE}
shiny::runGitHub("wc18-age", "matt-dray")
```

The app depends on the packages {shiny}, {shinythemes} and {DT}. I used the data set in the [AllezCannes/WorldCupSquads](https://github.com/AllezCannes/WorldCupSquads) GitHub repo, which contains player data scraped from Wikipedia by user [philstraforelli](https://github.com/philstraforelli).  

The app asks merely for your birth date---selectable from the dropdown menu---and calculates the number and percentage of players younger than you, with an interactive table that lists who they are.

</div>

A colleague suggested that wasn't enough punishment. So I updated it to tell you how many of the players you could be parent to (assuming you had them when you were age 18).

Here's some solid reviews I've received so far:

>Very depressing

>I knew I was too old to become a great footballer

>Just what I needed to see

Enjoy! And take inspiration from [Kazuyoshi 'King Kazu' Miura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuyoshi_Miura), a Japanese 51-year-old (born 1967) who is still playing at time of writing. He's apparently just [played a match for Yokohama FC alongside 16-year-old Koki Saito](https://twitter.com/yokhin/status/1020981764276260864?s=21) (born 2001), who in theory is young enough to be his grandson!

[^div1]: Season 2000/2001: 18th place and relegation to Division 1. After having climbed from Division 2 to the Prem in the preceding two seasons, lol. Who said being a Man City fan was boring?
[^shinyapps]: It was hosted originally on shinyapps.io, but I took it down to make room for another app.
