<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/wc18-age/">an R Shiny app that tells you how many players at World Cup 2018 were younger than you</a>. It’s designed to make you feel old. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>Here’s some solid reviews I’ve received so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Very depressing</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I knew I was too old to become a great footballer</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Just what I needed to see</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks folks!</p>

<h1>I was at the World Cup Final</h1>

<p>So the World Cup is over for another year.</p>
<p>I managed to get tickets for the final, where <a href="http://www.conifa.org/en/members/karpatalya/">Karpatlya</a> – a Hungarian diaspora in Ukraine – overcame the powerful <a href="http://www.conifa.org/en/members/northern-cyprus/">Northern Cyprus</a> team on penalties at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Enfield, London.</p>
<p>Another successful tournament from the <a href="http://www.conifa.org/en/about-us/">Confederation of Independent Football Associations</a> (CONIFA).</p>

<h1>It didn’t come home</h1>
<p>Oh and also the far-less popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> has finished.</p>
<p>Wonderkid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9">Kylian Mbappé</a> picked up the young player of the tournament as France lifted the trophy for the second time in their history.</p>
<p>Yes, 19-year-old Mbappé is young enough to have been born <em>after</em> France’s last World Cup win in 1998.</p>

<h1>Could I still be an international superstar?</h1>
<p>It seems only yesterday that I was dreaming of starting alongside hall-of-famer Bermudan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Goater">Shaun Goater</a> in the Manchester City starting XI at the turn of the millennium. (That reference probably dates me quite well.)</p>
<p>Obviously I can still make it as an elite footballer. Right?</p>
<p>What better way to find out than to build an app with R Shiny?</p>

<div id="the-app" class="section level1">
<h1>The app</h1>
<p><a href="https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/wc18-age/">Access the app in full on its very own page</a>. Here’s a screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-07-17-how-many-world-cup-footballers-were-younger-than-you_files/app.png" alt="A screenshot of the app"></p>
<p>The app asks merely for your birth date – selectable from the dropdown menu – and calculates the number and percentage of players younger than you, with an interactive table that lists who they are.</p>
<p>A colleague suggested that wasn’t enough punishment. So I updated it to tell you how many of the players you could be <em>parent</em> to, assuming you had them when you were age 18.</p>
<p>Enjoy! And take inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuyoshi_Miura">Kazuyoshi ‘King Kazu’ Miura</a>, a Japanese 51-year-old (born 1967) who is still playing at time of writing. He’s apparently just <a href="https://twitter.com/yokhin/status/1020981764276260864?s=21">played a match for Yokohama FC alongside 16-year-old Koki Saito</a> (born 2001), who in theory is young enough to be his grandson!</p>

<p>The code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/wc18-age">matt-dray/wc18-age</a> repo. The content and design may change at some point.</p>
<p>The app is hosted on the <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/">shinyapps.io free plan</a> and will stop working when more than 25 hours of use are recorded. Or I might just remove it one day with no explanation.</p>
<p>I used the data set in the <a href="https://github.com/AllezCannes/WorldCupSquads">AllezCannes/WorldCupSquads</a> GitHub repo, which contains player data scraped from Wikipedia by user <a href="https://github.com/philstraforelli">philstraforelli</a>.</p>
