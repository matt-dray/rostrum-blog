<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>This site now uses <a href="">GoatCounter</a> instead of <a href="">Google Analytics</a>. GoatCounter is a lightweight and unobtrusive site-visit counter made by the independent developer <a href="https://www.arp242.net">Martin Tournoij</a>.</p>

<h1>What I need</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/02/27/get-blogging/">I write posts on this blog for me, primarily</a>. It’s great if others find the content useful or interesting. I don’t and never will make money from this site, so why would I care how many visits it gets?</p>
<p>A highly-viewed post indicates to me that the topic is worth talking about. It’s a signal that it might be worth writing more about that thing in future.</p>
<p>Given how quickly things change, it’s also good to know which posts might need updating or need to carry a health warning. I don’t want people to visit this blog and be given erroneous or out-of-date information.</p>
<p>So I think I have a use case. Except I don’t want to ‘track’; I just want a count of visits to each page.</p>

<h1>Friendship ended</h1>
<p>I’ve been using Google Analytics for this blog since it began in April 2018. Why? It’s free, it’s ubiquitous, it’s easily implemented.</p>
<p>Google Analytics is massively bloated for my use case, though. I don’t need to create marketing reports, optimise for click rates or see what visitors have eaten for breakfast.</p>
<p>But mostly I’m uncomfortable with various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google">privacy concerns</a> around the company and platform. I don’t need or want you to be tracked. I don’t want to be a potential node for data harvesting.</p>

<p>So why is GoatCounter better?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Considerate</li>
<li>Transparency</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Simple interface</li>
</ol>
<p>It probably doesn’t need a GDPR notice. goatcounter.com/gdpr</p>
<p>The process is up front.</p>

<div id="the-divorce" class="section level1">
<h1>The divorce</h1>
<p>Switching to GoatCounter was easy. There were basically two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Goodbye GA: I removed the Google Analytics token from <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/blob/master/config.toml">the site’s <code>config.toml</code> file</a></li>
<li>Hello GoatCounter: I added a supplied line of code to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of the site</li>
</ol>
<p>Painless. And in fact, I used a feature of Netlify to add the needed line of code. The service inserts the code on deployment, without needing to add it explicitly to your site.</p>
<p>This site was made with the R package {blogdown}, which uses Hugo, and is deployed using Netlify. Your mileage may vary.</p>
