<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>This blog now uses <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a> instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics">Google Analytics</a>. GoatCounter is a lightweight and unobtrusive site-visit counter made by developer <a href="https://www.arp242.net">Martin Tournoij</a>.</p>

<h1>Do blogposts dream of electric goats?</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/02/27/get-blogging/">I write posts on this blog for me and for other learners</a>. It’s great if people find the content useful or interesting.</p>
<p>But I don’t and never will make money from this site, so why would I care how many visits it gets?</p>
<p>A highly-viewed post indicates to me that the topic is worth talking about. It’s a signal that it might be worth writing more about that thing in future. Popular posts might also need updating over time to keep the information up to date.</p>
<p>So I think I have a use case. Except I don’t want to ‘track’ people; I just want to count visits views.</p>

<div id="friendship-ended" class="section level1">
<h1>Friendship ended</h1>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics">Google Analytics</a> for this blog since it began in April 2018. Why? My naïve reasons were that it’s free, it’s ubiquitous and it’s easily <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html">implemented in {blogdown}</a>.</p>
<p>It’s massively bloated for my use case though. Acquisition reports, revenue per user and cohort analysis are not relevant to me. And I don’t even know what they mean.</p>
<p>More importantly, I’m uncomfortable with various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_concerns_regarding_Google">privacy concerns</a> around the company and platform. I don’t need or want you to be the product.</p>
<p>This change has been a long time coming and follows my earlier removal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disqus">the Disqus comment platform</a>, thanks to <a href="https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/">a Maëlle Salmon post</a>.</p>

<h1>New best friend</h1>
<p><a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/google-analytics/">A number of alternatives are available</a>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> but I chose <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a> by independent developer <a href="https://www.arp242.net">Martin Tournoij</a>. Why?</p>
<p>To summarise, the large type at the top of <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">the GoatCounter home page</a> says:</p>

<h1>Herding GoatCounter</h1>
<p>Switching to GoatCounter was straightforward.</p>
<p>This blog was created with the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">{blogdown}</a>, which is built on the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo static site generator</a>, and it’s deployed via <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Your mileage may vary, but there were basically three steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Remove the Google Analytics token from <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/blob/master/config.toml">the site’s <code>config.toml</code> file</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/signup">Create a GoatCounter account</a>.</li>
<li>Add a single script tag to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of your site<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For that last step I used <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/post-processing/snippet-injection/">a special Netlify feature that inserts code snippets into the HTML of your site on deployment</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> I didn’t have to worry about where to put it in the code of the site.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">
Analytics straight into the vein.
</p>
</div>
<p>Your stats will then be available from a URL in the form <code>https://yoursite.goatcounter.com</code>, which you set during the sign-up process.</p>
<p>Now you can start counting sheep. Er… goats.</p>
</div>
<div id="greatest-of-all-time-goat" class="section level1">
<h1>Greatest Of All Time (GOAT)</h1>
<p>The switch does mean I’ll lose cumulative view counts for posts that already exist, but I’m not bothered about that. I can always export the Google Analytics data and manually add it to GoatCounter’s counts.</p>
<p>For interest, here’s the most viewed posts as counted by Google Analytics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/04/04/repaying-tom-nook-with-r6/">Repaying Tom Nook with {R6}</a> (Apr 2020)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/12/27/pkgs-2019/">Packages that Sparked Joy in 2019</a> (Dec 2019)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/05/24/xaringan-template/">Package a {xaringan} template</a> (May 2019)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/06/26/mail-merge/">Mail merge with R and Dawson’s Creek</a> (Jun 2018)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/09/20/say-package/">How do you pronounce {dplyr}?</a> (Sep 2019)</li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, the <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/04/04/repaying-tom-nook-with-r6/">post about {R6}</a> is a good example of something I wanted to learn and then blog about for posterity. I think the timing helped in people viewing it, since <a href="https://animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> had just been released to great fanfare. To illustrate the ‘zeitgeistiness’, this post had the highest view spike of any post and has settled down a great deal since then.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/06/26/mail-merge/">‘mail merge’ post</a> is a good example of <a href="https://twitter.com/drob/status/928447584712253440?s=20">that classic David Robinson tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a function. When you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given its popularity, I also decided to overhaul it to make it more simple and accessible. It also led to a later post on <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/03/12/knit-with-params/">parameterised R Markdown reports</a>, which I think is actually the better solution in most cases.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have known any of this without having a record of page views, but the method for collecting that data no longer <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=grinds%20my%20goat">grinds my goat</a>.</p>
