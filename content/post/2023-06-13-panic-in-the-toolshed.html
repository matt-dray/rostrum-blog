<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/government-toolshed/">some slides</a> to tell data scientists in the public sector what they already know: share the tools you’ve developed.</p>

<h1>An axe to grind</h1>
<p>I’m speaking today at an event for UK government data scientists with a theme of ‘the data science toolshed’. My plea is small: I want public sector workers to share the tools they make<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We should build modular things like R packages that are easy to use and develop; make them available to everyone to minimise duplication and encourage collaboration; and maximise reach by telling everyone about it. This is how we improve quality and build our community. And save money for the taxpayer.</p>
<p>Handily, this is already expressed in the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice">Technology Code of Practice</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Share, reuse and collaborate: avoid duplicating effort and unnecessary costs by collaborating across government and sharing and reusing technology, data, and services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve had a small experience with this: I made <a href="https://co-analysis.github.io/a11ytables/">the {a11ytables} R package</a> to help producers of stats publications automate the creation of best-practice, accessible spreadsheets. It’s now being used in several organisations and is referenced from <a href="https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/further-resources-for-releasing-statistics-in-spreadsheets/">the government’s best-practice guidance</a>.</p>
<p>Success? Maybe. But also PANIK: I’ve left the organisation where I made it; I was the sole developer; I worry that I should have thought about this sooner; that I should fork and update it; that updating users will be hard; that links to the old package will break; and so on. Hopefully people will learn something from these missteps.</p>

<p>The slides were made with <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/">Revealjs via Quarto</a>, because of course they were.</p>

<h1>Clamp down</h1>
<p>So, we should sustainabilise (not a word), centralise and advertise the useful things we make. Maybe we could have a list of tools we’ve produced collectively in the public sector? Something like <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">an ‘Awesome’ list</a> or a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/">CRAN task view</a>. Maybe that would make it easier to find and develop existing solutions instead of building from scratch all the time.</p>
<p>Build a toolshed. They will come?</p>
