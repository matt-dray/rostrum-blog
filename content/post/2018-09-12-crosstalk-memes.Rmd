# EARL 2018

[EARL 2018](https://earlconf.com/2018/london/) is a conference for solving business problems with R.

[I'm speaking there](https://earlconf.com/2018/london/#matt-dray) about [the Crosstalk package](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) for [the R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).

Crosstalk allows [HTML widgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) -- lovely JavaScript visuals acessible in R -- to interact with each other. This means that selecting points in a table will update points in a map, for example. This replicates some functions of [the Shiny package](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) -- a popular R tool for interactive apps -- *without* the need for a server or knowledge of how to program Shiny apps.

[My talk](https://matt-dray.github.io/earl18-presentation/#1) describes how I helped policy makers explore schools data by creating a self-service tool incrementally with the [R-Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)-powered package [Flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) and Crosstalk for interactivity between the HTML widgets for interactive maps ([Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)) and tables ([DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)).

Here it is:

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

# Memestravaganza

Since it's 2018, the only way to publicise such a presentation is to exploit the power of [memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes) and social media; the only method for communicating with [millenials](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/05/22/avocado-latte-may-just-what-hipster-millennials-dreamed-maybe-not/102002538/) and [younglings](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/078/youngling.jpg) these days.

But why stop at one meme? Why not a *meme advent calendar* counting down the week in advance of the conference?[^1]

I've reproduced them here with a bit more context. If you're on mobile you'll see the rendered tweets. If on desktop, you'll need to click the <pic.twitter.com> links in each one.[^2]

## Day one

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1037226196797415425")
```

Yeah, so I figured that Shiny was the only way to make interactive apps. But I had a problem: no server access for hosting the app. Crosstalk is worth considering in this instance because you can share outputs as HTML files, which will open in the user's browser.

## Day two

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1037597114874912769")
```

R users can probably recognise an interactive app made with Shiny[^3]. Probably a [Flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) is easy to recognise too; these are typically used for non-interactive dashboard displays, but Crosstalk can be used to blur this line by making the elements interact with each other.

## Day three

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1037951262766055424")
```

Self-explanatory, really. A small app can be made using Crosstalk and shared freely. Try it!

## Day four

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1038306444045639680")
```

It's 2018. You've got to exploit Trump for personal gain at some point. One potential drawback of Shiny is the need to host the app on a server. Not ideal if you don't have acces to one. This is not a problem with Crosstalk-enabled tools, which you can share as HTML files.

## Day five

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1038727929998598145")
```

Yeah, so there's a false equivalency here. Crosstalk doesn't necessarily help provide a direct replacement for Shiny. You still need Shiny to make 'proper' apps. But hey, the picture that the little girl has drawn still looks like a cat, right?

Since everything is rendered in-browser, you're limited by your browser's power. This means that the number of points on your interactive map, for example, is limited. In practice it's maybe a couple of hundred. You can get around this by controlling point layers that can be switched on and off so fewer points are rendered at any one point But that's a pain.

## Day six

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1039034098214416384")
```

Let's say you've read your data into the object `data`. Ordinarily you would do `leaflet::leaflet(data)`, `DT::datatable(data)`, etc, to create HTML widgets containing the data. To get the widgets to talk to each other with Crosstalk, you make a *shared data* object: `shared <- SharedData$new(data)`. Now you can do `leaflet::leaflet(shared)`, `DT::datatable(shared)`, etc, to get widget interactivity. Only one extra line of code is needed.

## Day seven

*Loading...*

[^1]: Answer: because you have better things to do.
[^2]: I'm not sure why the whole tweet -- include the image -- doesn't render on desktop. I'll investigate.
[^3]: Yeah, but have you seen [The New Zealand tourism dashboard](https://mbienz.shinyapps.io/tourism_dashboard_prod/)?
