# EARL 2018

I gave a talk called 'Crosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny'[^dull] at the 2018 [EARL conference](https://earlconf.com) in London.

[The {crosstalk} package](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) by [Joe Cheng](https://twitter.com/jcheng?lang=en) allows [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/)---JavaScript visualisations wrapped in R code---to interact with each other. Filtering the data in widget causes all widgets to be filtered. This can be done inside an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document (including [Flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)) for easy server-less sharing in HTML format.

# {crosstalk} in action

Below is a very simple example from [the {crosstalk} documentation site](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/using.html). Click and drag to highlight points in the interactive plot (`d3scatter` package) and 'brush' the map markers (button in upper left) on the interactive map (`leaflet` package) and see how selections in each impact each other. Without {crosstalk}, selections in one of these widgets *would not* impact the others.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(crosstalk)
library(leaflet)
library(d3scatter)

shared_quakes <- SharedData$new(quakes[sample(nrow(quakes), 100),])

d3scatter(shared_quakes, ~depth, ~mag, width = "100%", height = 300)

leaflet(shared_quakes, width = "100%", height = 300) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers()
```

You can find [a more advanced example of {crosstalk} in action using Gapminder data](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/209203_02f14fea3274448bbbf8d04c99c6051b.html). It links HTML widgets from three packages -- `leaflet`, `d3scatter` and `DT` -- and includes a couple of sliders for filtering. All of this in less than 80 lines of code.

Remember all this is happening *in the browser* and *without Shiny*. And all you need to do is give each of your widgets a 'shared data' object. So instead of this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
data <- readRDS("data/some_data.RDS")  # get data
datatable(data)  # interactive table
leaflet(data) %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers()  # map
```

We can just add one extra line to create the shared data object and pass that to our widgets instead:

```{r eval=FALSE}
data <- readRDS("data/some_data.RDS")
shared <- SharedData$new(data)  # just add this line
datatable(shared)  # now refer to the shared data object
leaflet(shared) %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers()
```

# Slides

My task: I had to create a very simple app for our users to explore schools data. My problem: I didn't have a server for hosting such an app. In other words, [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) wasn't really feasible in this case.

I've embedded the slides below. Click inside the frame and use the left and right arrow keys to navigate. Press 'p' to see the presenter notes.

You can also [view the slides in a dedicated browser tab](https://matt-dray.github.io/earl18-presentation/).

On GitHub you can find [code for the presentation](https://github.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation), written with [the `xaringan` package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html), and [code for the dummy examples in it](https://github.com/matt-dray/earl18-crosstalk).

# Memestravaganza

Since it's 2018, the only way to publicise such a presentation is to exploit the power of [memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes) and social media; the only method for communicating with [millenials](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/05/22/avocado-latte-may-just-what-hipster-millennials-dreamed-maybe-not/102002538/) and [younglings](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/078/youngling.jpg) these days.

But why stop at one meme? Why not a *meme advent calendar* counting down the week in advance of the conference?[^answer] You can [find them all (plus bonuses) in my earl18-presentation GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/blob/master/memes/links.md)

I've reproduced them here with a bit more context.

## Day one

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/master/memes/scroll-of-truth.jpg" alt="An explorer finds the scroll of truth and it says 'Shiny isn't always the answer, so he throws it away in disgust.">

Yeah, so I figured that Shiny was the only way to make interactive apps with R. But I had a problem: no server access for hosting the app. {crosstalk} is worth considering in this instance because you can share outputs as HTML files, which will open in the user's browser.

## Day two

[Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1037597114874912769)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/master/memes/is-this.jpg" alt="A man, labelled 'me six months ago' gestures to a butterfly labelled 'crosstalk + flexdashboard' and says 'is this Shiny?'">

R users can probably recognise an interactive app made with Shiny[^nz]. Probably a [Flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) is easy to recognise too; these are typically used for non-interactive dashboard displays, but {crosstalk} can be used to blur this line by making the elements interact with each other.

## Day three

[Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1037951262766055424)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/master/memes/american-chopper-argument.jpg" alt="A man argues that the other must use Shiny because it's the only way to get interactivity; the other man says {crosstalk} solves this; the first man relents.">

Self-explanatory, really. A small app can be made using {crosstalk} and shared freely. Try it!

## Day four

[Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1038306444045639680)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/master/memes/trump.jpg" alt="President Trump holds up a document he has just signed, which reads 'CROOKED Hillary hosts Shiny apps on a PRIVATE server! EVERYONE agrees that TRUE Americans consider CROSSTALK!'">

It's 2018. You've got to exploit Trump for personal gain at some point. One potential drawback of Shiny is the need to host the app on a server. Not ideal if you don't have access to one. This is not a problem with {crosstalk}-enabled tools, which you can share as HTML files.

Bonus:

## Day five

[Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1038727929998598145)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/master/memes/trace-cat.jpg" alt="A girl traces around her cat labelled 'Shiny', revealing a poor rendering underneath labelled 'Crosstalk'.">

Yeah, so there's a false equivalency here. {crosstalk} doesn't necessarily help provide a direct replacement for Shiny. You still need Shiny to make 'proper' apps. But hey, the picture that the little girl has drawn still looks like a cat, right?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/master/memes/bad-boy.jpg" alt="A car salesman slaps the roof of a car and says 'This bad boy fits so few data in it' to a customer.">

Since everything is rendered in-browser with {crosstalk}, you're limited by your browser's power. This means that the number of points on your interactive map, for example, is limited. In practice it's maybe a couple of hundred. You can get around this by controlling point layers that can be switched on and off so fewer points are rendered at any one point But that's a pain.

## Day six

[Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1039034098214416384)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/master/memes/swerve.jpg" alt="A car labelled 'me realising how simple Crosstalk is' swerves off the freeway, labelled 'data', onto the off-ramp labelled 'SharedData$new(data)'.">

Let's say you've read your data into the object `data`. Ordinarily you would do `leaflet::leaflet(data)`, `DT::datatable(data)`, etc, to create HTML widgets containing the data. To get the widgets to talk to each other with {crosstalk}, you make a *shared data* object: `shared <- SharedData$new(data)`. Now you can do `leaflet::leaflet(shared)`, `DT::datatable(shared)`, etc, to get widget interactivity. Only one extra line of code is needed.

## Day seven

[Link to tweet](https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1039395576352329729)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/master/memes/arms.jpg" alt="Two muscular arms labelled 'Shiny' and 'Crosstalk' grip their hands, labelled 'sweet apps', in triumph.">

You can use both frameworks to do cool stuff! Just consider the context and the limitations of {crosstalk} when you do this.

Also, turns out I punked you: my talk was called 'Crosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny' but [you can actually put Shiny in your {crosstalk}](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/shiny.html). Why? Your brushing and filtering with {crosstalk} can be used to generate Shiny outputs and vice versa. For simplicity, my talk focuses only on {crosstalk}

[^dull]: Running joke: *Shiny without Shiny? Sounds like a **dull** talk lol.*
[^answer]: Answer: because you have better things to do.
[^nz]: Yeah, but have you seen [The New Zealand tourism dashboard](https://mbienz.shinyapps.io/tourism_dashboard_prod/)?
