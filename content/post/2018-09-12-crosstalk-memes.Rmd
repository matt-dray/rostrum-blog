# EARL 2018

I gave a talk called [*Crosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny*](https://earlconf.com/2018/london/#matt-dray)[^1] at the [EARL 2018 conference in London](https://earlconf.com/2018/london/).

[The `crosstalk` package](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) by [Joe Cheng](https://twitter.com/jcheng?lang=en) allows [HTML widgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) -- JavaScript visualisations wrapped in R code -- to interact with each other. This can be done inside an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document (including [Flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)) for easy server-less sharing in HTML format.

# Crosstalk in action

Below is a very simple example from [the Crosstalk documentation site](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/using.html). Click and drag to highlight points in the interactive plot (`d3scatter` package) and 'brush' the map markers (button in upper left) on the interactive map (`leaflet` package) and see how selections in each impact each other. Without Crosstalk, selections in one of these widgets *would not* impact the others.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(crosstalk)
library(leaflet)
library(d3scatter)

shared_quakes <- SharedData$new(quakes[sample(nrow(quakes), 100),])

d3scatter(shared_quakes, ~depth, ~mag, width = "100%", height = 300)

leaflet(shared_quakes, width = "100%", height = 300) %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addMarkers()
```

You can find [a more advanced example of Crosstalk in action using Gapminder data](http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/209203_02f14fea3274448bbbf8d04c99c6051b.html). It links HTML widgets from three packages -- `leaflet`, `d3scatter` and `DT` -- and includes a couple of sliders for filtering. All of this in less than 80 lines of code.

Remember all this is happening *in the browser* and *without Shiny*. And all you need to do is give each of your widgets a 'shared data' object. So instead of this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
data <- readRDS("data/some_data.RDS")  # get data
datatable(data)  # interactive table
leaflet(data) %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers()  # map
```

We can just add one extra line to create the shared data object and pass that to our widgets instead:

```{r eval=FALSE}
data <- readRDS("data/some_data.RDS")
shared <- SharedData$new(data)  # just add this line
datatable(shared)  # now refer to the shared data object
leaflet(shared) %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers()
```

# Slides

My task: I had to create an app for our users -- policy makers -- to explore schools data to inform a funding programme. My problem: I didn't have a server for hosting such an app. In other words, [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) wasn't really feasible in this case.

Below are my slides. Click it and hit your left and right arrow keys to navigate. Press 'p' to see the presenter notes.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url('https://matt-dray.github.io/earl18-presentation/')
```

On GitHub you can find [code for the presentation](https://github.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation), written with [the `xaringan` package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html), and [code for the dummy examples in it](https://github.com/matt-dray/earl18-crosstalk).

# Memestravaganza

Since it's 2018, the only way to publicise such a presentation is to exploit the power of [memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/memes) and social media; the only method for communicating with [millenials](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/05/22/avocado-latte-may-just-what-hipster-millennials-dreamed-maybe-not/102002538/) and [younglings](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/078/youngling.jpg) these days.

But why stop at one meme? Why not a *meme advent calendar* counting down the week in advance of the conference?[^2]

I've reproduced them here with a bit more context. If you're on mobile you'll see the rendered tweets. If on desktop you might not see them in certain browsers, but [you can access them from the GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/blob/master/memes/links.md).[^3]

## Day one

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1037226196797415425")
```

Yeah, so I figured that Shiny was the only way to make interactive apps. But I had a problem: no server access for hosting the app. Crosstalk is worth considering in this instance because you can share outputs as HTML files, which will open in the user's browser.

## Day two

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1037597114874912769")
```

R users can probably recognise an interactive app made with Shiny[^4]. Probably a [Flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) is easy to recognise too; these are typically used for non-interactive dashboard displays, but Crosstalk can be used to blur this line by making the elements interact with each other.

## Day three

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1037951262766055424")
```

Self-explanatory, really. A small app can be made using Crosstalk and shared freely. Try it!

## Day four

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1038306444045639680")
```

It's 2018. You've got to exploit Trump for personal gain at some point. One potential drawback of Shiny is the need to host the app on a server. Not ideal if you don't have acces to one. This is not a problem with Crosstalk-enabled tools, which you can share as HTML files.

## Day five

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1038727929998598145")
```

Yeah, so there's a false equivalency here. Crosstalk doesn't necessarily help provide a direct replacement for Shiny. You still need Shiny to make 'proper' apps. But hey, the picture that the little girl has drawn still looks like a cat, right?

Since everything is rendered in-browser, you're limited by your browser's power. This means that the number of points on your interactive map, for example, is limited. In practice it's maybe a couple of hundred. You can get around this by controlling point layers that can be switched on and off so fewer points are rendered at any one point But that's a pain.

## Day six

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1039034098214416384")
```

Let's say you've read your data into the object `data`. Ordinarily you would do `leaflet::leaflet(data)`, `DT::datatable(data)`, etc, to create HTML widgets containing the data. To get the widgets to talk to each other with Crosstalk, you make a *shared data* object: `shared <- SharedData$new(data)`. Now you can do `leaflet::leaflet(shared)`, `DT::datatable(shared)`, etc, to get widget interactivity. Only one extra line of code is needed.

## Day seven

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1039395576352329729")
```

Turns out I punked you: my talk is called 'Crosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny' but [you can actually put Shiny in your Crosstalk](http://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/shiny.html). Why? Your brushing and filtering with Crosstalk can be used to generate Shiny outputs and vice versa. For simplicity, my talk focuses only on Crosstalk. 

## Bonus memes

All the memes are available as JPEG files in [my earl18-presentation GitHub repository](https://github.com/matt-dray/earl18-presentation/tree/master/memes). There's also some extra ones in there.


[^1]: Running joke: *Shiny without Shiny? Sounds like a **dull** talk lol.*
[^2]: Answer: because you have better things to do.
[^3]: Scroll to the bottom of that link for bonus memes, you lucky thing.
[^4]: Yeah, but have you seen [The New Zealand tourism dashboard](https://mbienz.shinyapps.io/tourism_dashboard_prod/)?
