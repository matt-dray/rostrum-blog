<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>Animals get stuck in weird places. Oh, and the <code>sf</code> package in R can be used to convert co-ordinates for interactive mapping.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-problem" class="section level1">
<h1>The problem</h1>
<p>I often work with data that has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easting_and_northing">column for eastings and a column for northings</a>. Typically I want to convert these to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude">latitude</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitude</a> for interactive mapping using the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/"><code>leaflet</code></a> package in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a>. What might be an easy way to do this?</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<div id="animal-rescues" class="section level2">
<h2>Animal rescues</h2>
<p>I’ve got some data with eastings and northings. It’s <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/resource/e6211993-9ea2-4ed4-9378-7344653e9c31">animal rescue incidents</a> attended by the 🚒 <a href="https://www.london-fire.gov.uk/incidents/">London Fire Brigade</a> 🚒 from the excellent <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/">London Data Store</a>. In their words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The London Fire Brigade attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call ‘special services’). These ‘special services’ include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pertinent because a pigeon recently fell down our chimney.</p>

<h2>Clean the data</h2>

<p>So what happened?</p>
<p>Our eastings and northings have been combined with <code>st_as_sf()</code> into a two element <a href="https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls13_list-columns.html">list-column</a> called <code>geometry</code> that has type <code>sfc_POINT</code>. Our object also contains some metadata detailing the geometry type – points in our case – and the projection system of the coordinate data, which we converted to latlong with the <code>st_transform()</code> function.</p>
<p>Functions in the the <code>sf</code> package add an additional class – the ‘sf’ class – to our dataframe-class object. This makes it possible to perform spatial analysis.</p>
<div id="dplyr-friendly" class="section level2">
<h2><code>dplyr</code>-friendly</h2>
<p>One advantage of using <code>sf</code> is that sf-class objects use the <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">tidy data</a> paradigm that allows for manipulation using elements of the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>. This is a familiar and simple concept to grasp for many people, particularly R beginners. Conversely, the <code>sp</code> package creates the ‘Spatial Points Data Frame’ (SPDF) class for points data. SPDFs are an <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S4.html">S4 class</a>, which means they have ‘slots’ of data, coordinates, etc. This is probably slightly less wieldy for beginners.</p>
<p>So for example we can use the <code>filter()</code> function on our sf object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>filtered_sf &lt;- rescue_sf %&gt;%
  dplyr::filter(
    AnimalGroupParent %in% c(&quot;Dog&quot;, &quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Bird&quot;),  # just these animals
    DateTimeOfCall &gt; lubridate::ymd(&quot;2017-01-01&quot;) &amp;
      DateTimeOfCall &lt; lubridate::ymd(&quot;2017-12-31&quot;)  # 2017 only
  )</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="map-it" class="section level1">
<h1>Map it</h1>
<p>So now we can plot the data. The <code>addMarkers()</code> function in <code>leaflet</code> will accept our <code>geometry</code> list-column and plot the latitude and longitude of each point.</p>
<p>This is a very simple map for now. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>zoom with the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> buttons or scroll with your mouse wheel</li>
<li>click and drag to move the map</li>
<li>click the points to get a pop-up showing more information</li>
</ul>
