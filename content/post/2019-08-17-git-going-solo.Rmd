# tl;dr

This post is a basic, non-comprehensive, practical introduction to Git and GitHub, with a focus on Mac users working on a solo project. Here's a quick reference for some commonly-used Git commands:

| Command   | Short explanation                   |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `git init` | Put a folder under version control with Git |
| `git status` | Show changes |
| `git add <file>` | Confirm the changes to be committed |
| `git commit -m "<message>"` | Commit the changes with an explanation |
| `git push origin master` | Send your commits to GitHub |


# Git and GitHub

Git is a version control system that lets you track file changes on your computer, record why changes were made and lets you revert to a past state if something goes wrong.

GitHub is a website where you can store your code and Git history remotely on the web[^remotes]. It acts as a back-up for your work and its versions; lets you explore your code in your browser in a more visual and interactive way; lets other people see your code in the open and use it themselves; lets you record issues and to-do items; and much, much more.

Our goal in this post is to put a project folder under version control with Git and then upload it to GitHub. I assume you're a beginner and are, for now, working alone on a project.[^audience]

We'll be using the command line to do all of this. This is the place where you write code to tell your computer what to do, which you can access via software like ['Terminal' on a Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)). You may want to [see my earlier post for how to get basic stuff done with the command line](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/02/01/git-going-cl/) before you continue.

# Step-by-step

The steps below summarise what you need to do to set up and use Git and GitHub. I've split the steps into broad stages. Click a link to jump to that section.

[One-time tasks](#one-time):

* [Install Git](#install)
* [Create a GitHub account](#github-account)

[Project set-up](#project-setup):

1. [Create your project folder](#folder)
1. [Initiate Git](#init)
1. [Create a .gitignore file](#gitignore)

[A Git/GitHub workflow](#git-github-workflow) (you'll repeat these steps as you develop your project):

1. [Work on your files](#work)
1. [Check file status](#status)
1. [Add changes](#add)
1. [Commit changes](#commit)
1. [Push changes to GitHub](#push)

## One-time tasks {#one-time}

### Install Git {#install}

[Download it from the Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install.

You can check if Git is installed by typing `git --version` at the command line. You should get a response saying something like `git version 2.23.0`.

Note that Git is not an app; there's not an icon for it on your computer. It's a bunch of functions installed for use via the command line, with each command preceded with the word `git`.

### Create a GitHub account {#github-account}

GitHub is free to use but you need an account.

To make one, go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and click 'Sign-up for GitHub'. You'll need to provide a username (think hard about this), email address and password.

When prompted for a subscription level, choose 'free subscription'. You'll be able to do everything you need to do with this type of account; a premium account is more suitable for teams.

You'll be sent an automated email to verify your email address. Click the button in the email to confirm.

You don't need ot do anything else right now. Just make sure your GitHub profile page accessible at `github.com/yourusername`.

## Project set-up {#project-setup}

The following subsections are for creating your project folder and activating Git.

### Create your project folder {#folder}

You should put all of the code, data, tests and documentation for your project in one folder. Let's create it now.

In [part one of this 'Git going' series](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/02/01/git-going-cl/) you learnt how to navigate your computer's filesystem from the command line. We'll be using that knowledge here, so you may want to revisit.

At the command line:

1. Provide to `cd` the filepath where you want your project folder to be created (e.g. `cd ~/Documents`)
1. Create the project folder with `mkdir` (e.g. `mkdir project-name`)
1. Enter this new folder with `cd` (e.g. `cd project-name`)
1. Run `pwd` to print your working directory, which should be your newly-created project folder (subsequent Git commands will therefore be applied to this folder, which is what we want)

You could also create a new folder by pointing and clicking; just make sure you navigate to the folder at the command line

### Initiate Git {#init}

So we have our empty project folder, but it's not yet under version control. How can we make Git aware of this folder and start tracking changes?

Type `git init` to initiate Git in the project folder. You'll get something like `Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/luigi/Documents/project/.git/` if it was successful.

What did this do? Run `ls -a` to list all the files in the folder. You'll see there's now a hidden `.git` folder (files preceded with a period aren't visible by default). It's hidden because it's going to run in the background and you can forget about it for now.

Note that you don't have to create a new folder from scratch

### Create a .gitignore file {#gitignore}

There are files that you may not want to commit. This might include sensitive files, large data sets or language-specific artefacts.

You can leave instructions in a special 'gitignore' file that tells Git not to worry about recording certain things.

You can add a .gitignore file by typing `touch .gitignore` at the command line. Typing `open .gitignore` will open it in a text editor. Now you can add specific files, or file types, to be ignored.

You could start by copying from [a template](https://github.com/github/gitignore). For example, see [the template for R](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/R.gitignore). The first thing in that template is `.Rhistory` -- a log of all the commands you've typed -- which you probably don't need to have tracked.

You could add things like `filename.csv` to ignore a specific dataset, or `*.csv` (meaning any filename that ends with `.csv`) to ignore all CSV files. Mac users will also want to add `.DS_Store`, which is [a kind of Mac-specific metadata file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store).

## The Git/GitHub workflow {#git-github-workflow}

The basic steps are to:

* make changes to your work
* 'stage' the changes (earmark the files to be recorded)
* 'commit' the changes (confirms the files and explains why with a short message)
* 'push' the changes (send a record of the changes to GitHub)

You can think of this like sending a carbon copy letter


When to commit?

### Work on your files {#work}

Develop your code as usual.

When you've reached a sensible point at which to create a 'snapshot' of your work.

### Check file status {#status}

Type `git status` to see the files that have been created or modified.

Note that any files that are in your .gitignore will not appear here. They've been ignored, of course.

### Add changes {#add}

Dangers of using `.` to add everything.

### Commit changes {#commit}

The `-m` flag

Writing a good commit

### Push changes to GitHub {#push}

[^audience]: In fact, the real audience are the participants of the UK government's [Data Science Accelerator](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-science-accelerator-programme/introduction-to-the-data-science-accelerator). Participants are analysts who may have little knowledge of programming.
[^remotes]: Other services are available, like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), but we'll focus on GitHub.
