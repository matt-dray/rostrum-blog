# tl;dr

This post is a basic introduction to git. Here are some commonly-used commands:

| Command   | Short explanation                   |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------- |
| `git init` | **Init**iate git in a folder        |
| `git status` | Show changes and whether they're staged |
| `git add <file>` | Stage changes ready for committing |
| `git commit -m "<message>"` | **Init**iate git in a folder |
| `git checkout -b <new branch>` | **Init**iate git in a folder |
| `git branch` | **Init**iate git in a folder |

# git?

What's git? In short, it's a version control system that lets you track file changes, record why changes were made, and revert to a past state if something goes wrong.

Have you ever made changes to your code that stop it from working, except you have no idea why? git can help you revert to an older state.

Our goal in this post is to start from the beginning: we'll simply put a project folder under version control using git.

git is used at the command line -- the place where you type requests directly to your computer. You may want to [see my earlier post for how to interact with the command line](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/02/01/git-going-cl/) before you continue.

# Step-by-step

There's some things you need to do to set up git and then use it for your project. I've summarised them here and you can click to go to each section.

The one-time task:

* [Install git](#install)

Project set-up tasks:

1. [Create your project folder](#folder)
1. [Initiate git](#init)
1. [Create a .gitignore file](#gitignore)

The git project workflow (you'll repeat these steps as you develop your project):

1. [Work on your files](#work)
1. [Check file status](#status)
1. [Add changes](#add)
1. [Commit changes](#commit)

Don't worry if these terms don't make sense yet; they're explained in more depth in each section.

## Install git {#install}

To use git you need [to download the installer for your operating system from the git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.

You can check the version number of your git installation to check if its been installed correctly. 

Open the program you use to access the command line (e.g. Terminal on a Mac, or Bash on Windows) and type `git --version`.

If it's installed, you should get a response saying something like `git version 2.23.0`. 

Aside: note that all git commands start with `git`, which tells the computer that 

## Project set-up

The following subsections are the things you do to set up your project and activate git.

### Create your project folder {#folder}

In [part one of this 'git going' series](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/02/01/git-going-cl/) you learnt how to navigate your computer's filesystem from the command line. We'll be using that knowledge here.

At the command line:

1. Navigate with `cd` to where you want your project folder to be (e.g. `cd ~/Documents`)
1. Create the project folder with `mkdir` (e.g. `mkdir project`)
1. Navigate into this folder with `cd` (e.g. `cd project`)
1. You can check if you're in the right place with `pwd` to print the working directory

You could also create a new folder by pointing and clicking; just make sure you navigate to the folder at the command line

### Initiate git {#init}

So we have our empty project folder, but it's not yet under version control. How can we make git aware of this folder and start tracking changes?

Type `git init` to initiate git in the project folder. You'll get something like `Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/luigi/Documents/project/.git/` if it was successful.

What did this do? Run `ls -a` to list all the files in the folder. You'll see there's now a hidden `.git` folder (files preceded with a period aren't visible by default). It's hidden because it's going to run in the background and you can forget about it for now.

Note that you don't have to create a new folder from scratch

### Create a .gitignore file {#gitignore}

There are files that you may not want to commit. This might include sensitive files, large data sets or language-specific artefacts.

You can leave instructions in a special 'gitignore' file that tells git not to worry about recording certain things You could start by [using a template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) and add what you need to it.

Take a closer look at [the template for R](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/R.gitignore), for example. The first thing is `.Rhistory` -- a log of all the commands you've typed -- which you probably don't need to have tracked.

You could add things like `filename.csv` to ignore specific datasets, or `*.csv` to ignore all CSV files. Mac users will also want to add `.DS_Store`, which is [a kind of Mac-specific metadata file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store).

## git project workflow

So we've created our project folder and added a `.gitignore` file.

When to commit?

### work on your files {#work}

### git status {#status}

### git add {#add}

Dangers of using `.` to add everything.

### git commit {#commit}

The `-m` flag
