# tl;dr

You have customer details. You want to send each person a personalised letter from a template. You want to mail merge, basically.[^andrie]

This post shows how you can use R to iteratively produce separate Microsoft Word reports from a common template, each one with slightly different data. Here I use R Markdown and the {knitr} package to render a separate report about each episode of Dawson's Creek (a classic use case!).

# Merge those mails

I remember learning to mail merge in computer class at the turn of the century; autocompleting a Word template letter with details for imaginary customers from some made-up Access database. 

I no longer need to invoice 'Mr Sonic The-Hedgehog' for ordering '25 chili dogs', but the general approach of generating the same template multiple times with different information is still pertinent. The difference now is that I don't want to use proprietary software to do it and I want the process to be more reproducible.

I've helped a few colleagues with this recently so they could avoid hours of copy-pasting. R is a natural choice for automating this kind of task and for maximising reproducibility.

# Who will she choose?

To keep to the turn-of-the-millennium theme, this post explains how to autogenerate reports that contain data for each episode of the first season of the hit late-90s-early-2000s-weirdly-articulate-teen-angst-love-triangle masterpiece that is [Dawson's Creek](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118300/){target='_blank'}. Data via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dawson%27s_Creek_episodes#Season_1:_1998){target='_blank'}.

I've created [an accompanying GitHub repository](https://github.com/matt-dray/mail-merge-2018){target='_blank'} where you can download or clone a whole R Project that replicates the approach used in this post.

# Approach

A basic overview of the process is that you:

* write a template document using R Markdown, with snippets of R code that will pull in the data for each element you're iterating over (e.g. Dawson's Creek episodes)
* make reference to a Word document that contains the style information for your output (i.e. fonts, colours, etc)
* loop over each element (e.g. each episode), supplying data to the template and rendering ('knitting') a separate output file for each one

[Update: this approach is quite basic. You may want to read [a more recent post on this blog](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/03/12/knit-with-params/){target='_blank'} that uses [parameterised R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html%23parameter_types%2F) reports and iteration with the {purrr} package, which may suit you better.]

## Set up

I recommend creating an RStudio Project with three files important to this task:

1. Your document template prepared in R Markdown (file type `.Rmd`)
2. Your style-reference document (`.docx`) that we'll put in a `style/` subfolder
3. A script (`.R`) file for reading your data and looping through each element 

Aside from your .Rproj file, your folder should also contain:

* a subfolder to hold the output files (e.g. `output/`)
* any additional subfolders you need for input files (e.g. `data/` and `images/`)
* an optional `README.md` file to explain the purpose of your work

Below is a more detailed explanation using the Dawson's Creek example. Click to jump to each section:

* [the R Markdown template](#template)
* [the Word document used as a style reference](#style)
* [the R script for iterating over the template](#loop)

## 1. The template {#template}

### R Markdown

Your report template should be an R Markdown file. In short, R Markdown files allow you to write plain text formatted with special symbols and insert R code inline or in 'chunks'. You can [find out more about R Markdown from the RStudio website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/){target='_blank'}. I've also written [a short guide to writing R Markdown documents](https://matt-dray.github.io/knitting-club/){target='_blank'} and created [a small set of slides](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/#1){target='_blank'}, both with beginners in mind.

You can see the full R Markdown file for this demo [in the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/mail-merge-2018/blob/master/01_template.Rmd){target='_blank'}.

### Specify Word output

The template itself should start with a YAML header section that states (i) the output type, which is `word_document` in this example[^word], and (ii) a path to the Word document that contains the style information (i.e. `style/dawson_style.docx` in this example). The style document is explained in [the next section](#style).

Here's what the basic YAML header looks like:

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
output:
  word_document:
    reference_docx: style/dawson_style.docx
---
```

### Reference the data

We'll be feeding data into the template via an object called `episode`. This object is a data frame that contains the variables that we want to put into our template, with one row per episode (more on this in [the section below about iterating](#loop) below).

When it comes to iterating over the data to produce each output file, we'll be subsetting a row at a time so we only pass one episode's information to the template.

This means the R code in our R Markdown file should refer to the `episode` object. For example, here's some inline code that will be rendered into the production code and title ([see this in the source repo on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/mail-merge-2018/blob/dd0e15b9653d1aadb310f679316d1dadb1c5398f/01_template.Rmd#L15){target='_blank'}):

```{r eval=FALSE}
`r paste0(episode$production_code, ": '", episode$title, "'")`
```

And here's an example R Markdown chunk that will get a table containing information about the episodes ([see this in the source code](https://github.com/matt-dray/mail-merge-2018/blob/dd0e15b9653d1aadb310f679316d1dadb1c5398f/01_template.Rmd#L19-L28){target='_blank'}):

```{r eval=FALSE}
episode %>% 
  dplyr::select(  # choose these columns for display
    Season = season,
    `Number in season` = number_in_season,
    `Number in series` = number_in_series,
    `Original air date` = original_air_date
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()  # print to output table
```

## 2. The style {#style}

The default output when rendering R Markdown to Word is a bit boring. Instead, you can create a separate dummy Word document that contains modified styles to suit your theme. 

You can read more about creating a style document in [Richard Layton's 'happy collaboration with Rmd to docx'](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html){target='_blank'} on the R Markdown site. Basically you create a dummy document in which you've set the formatting for each style element (title, third-level header, paragraph text, etc), store it in your working repository and refer to it from the YAML of your R Markdown report (as mentioned in [the section above](#template)).

<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">The style document</p>
</div>

You can download the example style file used in this demo [from the GitHub repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/mail-merge-2018/tree/master/){target='_blank'}.

## 3. Iterate {#loop}

So we have the template (`.Rmd`) and style (`.docx`) files in place. Now we need an R script (`.R`) to orchestrate the iteration of our outputs.

This script (i) reads the data and (ii) executes a loop that applies episode data to the template, saving to a specified subfolder with a unique file name. You'll get one document for each unique element; in this demo we'll get 13 because there are 13 rows (episodes) in our data set.

You can see the script file for this demo in [the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/mail-merge-2018/blob/master/02_loop.R){target='_blank'}.

After reading in the data with something like `data <- readr::read_csv(file = "data/dawsons-creek-season-1.csv")` you can write a loop that looks something like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
for (i in data$production_code){  # for each unique episode...
  
  # Isolate that episode from the dataset
  
  episode <- data[data$production_code == i, ]  
  
  # The one-row dataframe object 'episode' we just created will be used as the
  # source for filling the details in on the template file
  
  # Now render ('knit') the R Markdown file to Word format, name it and save it
  
  rmarkdown::render(
    input = "01_template.Rmd",  # path to the template
    output_file = paste0("episode_", i, ".docx"),  # name the output
    output_dir = "output"  # folder in which to put the output file
  )

}  # end of loop
```

So this code:

* loops through episodes given unique values in the `production_code` column
* subsets the `data` object (a data frame of all episodes) to isolate the production code for each episode in turn
* renders the template document after filling it with the `episode` data
* gives the file a name that incorporates the production code
* saves this file to the `output/` subfolder in our project directory

# Execute

Run the R script and the files will be rendered in turn according to the formatting in the style document, and added one by one to the `output/` folder. It's fun to open this folder and watch them pop into existence.

Congratulations! You now have a separate file that contains the information for each of the episodes in season 1 of Dawson's Creek! Make sure to share with your friends (assuming you're not in an awkward love triangle).
