# tl;dr

I present you a function that warns if an R script contains the Assignment Operator That Shall Not Be Named.

# Assign of the times

So, it's been confirmed with [extremely robust and objective evidence](https://twitter.com/kevcunningham/status/1370382498795040769?s=20): the left-assignment arrow (`x <- 1`) is better than equals (`x = 1`) for assignment in R.[^actually]

So, unless you hate democracy, you should protect yourself from aberrant code that uses the cursed symbol.

But what if a nefarious colleague still sends you their scuffed code? 

# Assignment refinement

I've created the `appraise_assignment()` function that will peek at a suspect script and warn you if it contains the foul mark.

```{r}
appraise_assignment <- function(file, destroy = FALSE) {
  
  trees <- lintr::get_source_expressions(file)  # parse code
  expr_len <- length(trees[[1]])  # we want the final element
  tokens <-  # extract tokens used in script
    trees$expressions[[expr_len]]$full_parsed_content[, "token"]
  
  if (any(tokens == "EQ_ASSIGN")) {  # '='
    warning("\nme = 'disgusted'\n") 
    if (destroy == TRUE) {
      answer <- readlines("Destroy file? y/n")
      if (answer == "y") cat("Have mercy! This time...")
    }
  } else if (any(tokens == "RIGHT_ASSIGN")) {  # '<-'
    cat("'unorthodox' -> you\n")
  } else if (any(tokens == "LEFT_ASSIGN")) {  # '->'
    cat("you <- 'hero'\n")
  } else {
    cat("anyway(assignment(is(even('what'))))\n")
  }
  
}
```

It uses [Jim Hester's {lintr} package](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) to parse R expressions and identify each 'token' that's used (maths symbols, special operators, variables, etc).

In particular, it spots the token called `EQ_ASSIGN`, which is when `=` is used in the context of assignment.

# I saw the assign

For demonstration purposes, I've written four temporary files containing left assign (`<-`), right assign (`->`, inferior mirror-copy of `<-`), equals (`=`), and no assignment at all.[^global] Our function will catch even a single deviation, even if proper assignment has also been used.

```{r}
temp <- tempdir()  # temp location to store files
purrr::walk2(
  c("x <- 1", "x <- 1; y -> 1", "x <- 1; y = 1", "x"),
  c("left", "right", "equals", "none"),
  ~writeLines(.x, file.path(temp, paste0(.y, ".R")))
)
```

First, let's pass the file containing the unquestionably correct assignment operator.

```{r}
appraise_assignment(file.path(temp, "left.R"))
```

Right-assignment is left-assignment's less-handsome sibling.

```{r}
appraise_assignment(file.path(temp, "right.R"))
```

Hold steady...

```{r}
appraise_assignment(file.path(temp, "equals.R"))
```

Phew, we got a warning, so we know the file is dangerous and should never be opened.

In fact, if you set the argument `destroy = TRUE` in `appraise_assignment()`, you'll be prompted to irrecoverably annihilate the rotten file forever.[^destroy]

For completeness, is it really an R script if it doesn't contain any assignment at all?

```{r}
appraise_assignment(file.path(temp, "none.R"))
```

# Assigning off

In conclusion, some assignment operators were created more equal than others. See [Colin Fay's round-up](https://colinfay.me/r-assignment/) to learn more about the history and plethora of these symbols (and be happy that the underscore is no longer legitimate).

Anyway, welcome to the best timeline, where we all recognise `<-` unequivocally as the champion and `=` can get rekt!

[^actually]: Actually, I don't really care which one you use, but that's less of a funny take. I prefer the left assignment operator because look! It's a little arrow! Quirky! Esoteric! An extra keystroke to exercise your fingers!
[^destroy]: Well, not really, because I don't want you to delete any of your files. But rest assured I've included `file.remove()` in my local version of the function and I'm not afraid to use it.
[^global]: We do not talk about `<<-`.
