# tl;dr

You can save your high score in games made with R. See [the package {hiscore}](https://github.com/matt-dray/hiscore) for a demo.

# Boot up

I wrote recently about how [R is a game engine](https://www.rostrum.blog/2023/04/02/splendid-r-games/) and started [a list of games written in R](https://github.com/matt-dray/splendid-r-games).

All good game engines should let you save a high score, right?

So I've done exactly this for a tiny concept package called [{hiscore}](https://github.com/matt-dray/hiscore)[^hiscore] that contains a simple game of luck 

The package runs code that saves your high score, which is retained between play sessions.

# Install

You can install the package [from GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/hiscore). It has no dependencies, but you'll need to be running R version 4, at least.

```{r install}
install.package("remotes")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/hiscore")
library(hiscore)
```

Of course, it's just a concept and I've intentionally kept this as trivial as possible, but you can [leave an issue](https://github.com/matt-dray/hiscore/issues) with bugs or ideas.

# Play

For demonstration purposes, the inbuilt game is super simple: get the longest streak of correctly guessed coinflips.

To play, run `play_coinflip()` and type <kbd>H</kbd> or <kbd>T</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> when prompted. Basically, a coinflip is simulated with `sample(c("H", "T"), 1)` and then compared to the user's input, supplied from the console following a `readline()` call.

Keep going until you get it wrong. If you get a new high score, it'll be saved.

```{r play}
play_coinflip()
```
```
[H]eads or [T]ails? Answer: H
Correct! Current score: 1
[H]eads or [T]ails? Answer: H
Incorrect! Final score: 1
New high score!
New high score saved.
```

You can retrieve the current high score with `get_save_data()`, which returns a little table.

```{r get-save-data}
get_save_data()
```
```
game high_score
1 coinflip          1
```

Of course, you could also set up the function so that it records different player names too. And you could add additional games that would get their own row in this table.

# Memory

Note that the high score data is retained on your computer even if you restart your session or reboot your machine. How so?

This is thanks to [the `tools::R_user_dir()` function](https://rdrr.io/r/tools/userdir.html), which was added to R in version 4.0. It builds system-specific paths to 'directories for storing R-related user-specific data, configuration and cache files' where you can save package-related information.

{hiscore} records top scores in this fashion. On my machine, the save location resolves to the following:

```{r r-user-dir, eval=TRUE}
tools::R_user_dir("hiscore", "data")
```

Regular readers[^exist] may remember that I used `R_user_dir()` in the {tamRgo} package ([blog](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/11/13/tamrgo/), [source](https://github.com/matt-dray/tamRgo)), which lets you look after a Tamagotchi-style cyber-pet in your console. I used the function to save a pet's 'blueprint' (details such as name, age and hunger level) persistently.

# Retry

Now imagine you want to retry to beat that incredible top score of 1. Since you last played, you probably restarted your session or computer.

```
Restarting R session...
```

But never fear: the high score was retained. You can see that when you run `play_coinflip()` again and are reminded of the current best.

```{r play-2}
library(hiscore)
play_coinflip()
```
```
Welcome. Your current high score is 1
[H]eads or [T]ails? Answer: h
Correct! Current score: 1
[H]eads or [T]ails? Answer: t
Correct! Current score: 2
[H]eads or [T]ails? Answer: h
Incorrect! Final score: 2
New high score!
New high score saved.
```

Great job, you doubled the previous record!

When you get a game over, the `play_coinflip()` function checks the current high score and compares it to the final score for the current play session. The saved data is overwritten if the score is higher.

```{r get-save-data-2}
get_save_data()
```
```
      game high_score
1 coinflip          2
```

I think it's a good idea to make it easy for people to destroy the stored data if they want, which you can do easily with `delete_save_data()`.

```{r delete}
delete_save_data()
```
```
Really delete? [Y]es/[N]o: Y
High score data deleted.
```

# Game over

How else could this approach be used in an R gaming perspective? You could use this to save a game state, similar to what's done for [{tamRgo}](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/11/13/tamrgo/). The user could input `S`ave instead of performing a guess, which would record the current status of the game so the user can return later. But that would feel like cheating for a game like coinflip.

Speaking of, here's a cheatcode as a bonus for reading this far:

```{r cheat}
cheat <- function(game, score) {
  user_dir <- tools::R_user_dir("hiscore", "data")
  score_path <- file.path(user_dir, "score_table.rds")
  score_table <- readRDS(score_path)
  score_game <- score_table[score_table[["game"]] == game, ]
  score_game[["high_score"]] <- score
  saveRDS(score_table, score_path)
  message("Congrats! You scored ", score, " at ", game, "!")
}

cheat("coinflip", 1e100)
```
```
Congrats! You scored 1e+100 at coinflip!
```

Heh heh heh.
