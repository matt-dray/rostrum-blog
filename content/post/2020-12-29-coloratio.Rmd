# tl;dr

I made [a small R package called {coloratio}](https://github.com/matt-dray/coloratio) to evaluate [colour-contrast ratios for accessibility](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/06/17/colour-contrast-why-does-it-matter/). Then I found out that  [{savonliquide}](https://github.com/feddelegrand7/savonliquide) already exists to do this.

# Accessible charts

The UK government's website, [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/), was developed with user needs and accessibility in mind. I've been using {ggplot2} to recreate [the simple, accessible chart styles](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/examples-of-visual-content-to-use-on-govuk/examples-of-visual-content-to-use-on-govuk) suggested for use on GOV.UK by [the Government Statistical Service](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/).

But I wondered: is it possible to programmatically select a high-contrast text colour to overlay the fill colours of a {ggplot2} barplot? You would want black text over white and vice versa, for example. 

What is 'high contrast' anyway? GOV.UK's [Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/colour/) refers to [W3C's contrast guidance from WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum), which suggests a ratio of 4.5:1 for regular text on a block-coloured background.

It isn't a big deal to program this 'manually', but that's not fun.

# Ratio calculation

## Is the contrast accessible?

How about a small package with some functions to derive colour contrast ratios? Introducing [{coloratio}](https://github.com/matt-dray/coloratio).

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/coloratio")
```

Pass two colours to `cr_get_ratio()` as hex values or named colours---see `colors()`---and it performs the necessary calculations to derive [relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#dfn-relative-luminance) and return a [colour contrast ratio](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#dfn-contrast-ratio).

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
library(coloratio)  # attach package

cr_get_ratio(
  "papayawhip", "#000000",  # colours to compare
  view = TRUE  # optional demo of colours 
)
```

This contrast value is above the 4.5 threshold, so we're good to go. You'll get a warning if the contrast is insufficient.

```{r}
cr_get_ratio("olivedrab", "olivedrab2")
```

Surprise: as stunning as an all-olivedrab palette might be, these colours aren't distinct enough to be accessible.

## Black or white?

`cr_get_ratio()` in turn powers the function `cr_choose_bw()`, which returns black or white depending on the greatest contrast with a supplied background colour.

```{r}
cr_choose_bw("snow")
cr_choose_bw("saddlebrown")
```

To demonstrate better, let's create a grouped barplot with lighter (`lemonchiffon3`) and darker (`hotpink4`) fill colours, then use `cr_choose_bw()` to choose black or white for the overlaying text.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # for data manipulation

# Example data
d <- data.frame(
  x_val = c("A", "A", "B", "B"),
  y_val = c(3, 6, 4, 10),
  z_val = c("a", "b", "a", "b")
) %>% 
  mutate(  # add colour columns
    fill_col = rep(c("hotpink4", "lemonchiffon3"), 2),
    text_col = map_chr(fill_col, coloratio::cr_choose_bw)
  )

d  # preview
```

No surprise: white was returned for the darker fill and black for the lighter fill.

We can now refer to this information in the `colour` argument of `geom_text()`.

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x_val, y_val, fill = z_val)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = d$fill_col) +    # fill colour
  geom_text(aes(y = 0.5, label = y_val), 
            position = position_dodge(0.9), 
            size = 5, colour = d$text_col) +  # text colour 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +  # clean up the theme
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), 
        legend.title = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank())
```

As desired: black on the lighter fill; white on the darker fill. The default would be black text, which would provide insufficient contrast for darker fills.

## Aside: `cr_choose_bw()` in `geom_text()`?

Originally I wanted `geom_text()` to choose text colours on the fly, rather than adding them to the input data. This roundabout solution---which outputs a similar plot to the one above---requires you to build the plot object, then interrogate it with `ggplot_build()` to identify the bar-fill colours.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Build simple grouped barplot again
p <- ggplot(d, aes(x_val, y_val, fill = z_val)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("hotpink4", "lemonchiffon3")) +
  coord_flip()

# Extract the p-object fills and choose text overlay colour
p + geom_text(
  aes(y = 0.5, label = y_val), position = position_dodge(0.9), size = 5,
  colour = map_chr(  # make text colour dependent on bar colour
    ggplot_build(p)[[1]][[1]]$fill,  # access p-object fills
    coloratio::cr_choose_bw   # choose black/white text based on fill
  )
)
```

I put this to [the RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/t/can-you-conditionally-choose-geom-text-colours-based-on-underlying-geom-bar-fills/91777) with no answer to date. Let me know if you have any ideas.

# A soapy slip-up

Having addressed my need, I was suspicious. Surely this has been done in R before? I put out a tweet to investigate.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1342160455557668866")
```

I soon realised my error. Merry Christmas!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1342267391007477762")
```

Whoops. [{savonliquide}](https://github.com/feddelegrand7/savonliquide) by [Ihaddaden M. EL Fodil](https://twitter.com/moh_fodil) can query the [WebAIM contrast checker API](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to get the contrast ratio for two colours. And it's on CRAN. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("savonliquide")
```

Maybe I missed it because of the name, which translates to 'hand soap'?

Anyway, like `coloratio::cr_get_ratio()`, you can pass two hex values or named colours to {savonliquide}'s `check_contrast()` function.

```{r}
savonliquide::check_contrast("blanchedalmond", "bisque2")
```

The output is richer than `coloratio::cr_get_ratio()`. You can see here that the supplied colours fail [additional accessibility checks from WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) that involve large text and more stringent contrast thresholds. 

Handily, there's also the `savonliquide::check_contrast_raw()` variant that returns a list with each result as an element.

# Acceptance

So... should you wash your hands of {coloratio}?[^savon] Well, it fills the micro-niche of an R package that doesn't require an internet connection to fetch colour contrast ratios. But it's probably never going to go on CRAN, so you should use {savonliquide}.

I certainly learnt a lesson about due diligence during package development. Especially because I also [discovered recently](https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1343289157565689856?s=20) that I had also somehow managed to reinvent [the {badger} package](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/badger) with [my own {badgr} package](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/05/08/readme-badge/).[^badgr] Whoops again.

At worst, I got to learn more about accessibility, practice some package building, and solve my initial problem (kinda).

I also got to admire the creativity of [the names in the named-colour set](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.ucsc.edu/dist/d/276/files/2015/10/colorbynames.png). 'Papayawhip' sounds really appealing. Or perhaps painful. _Just like package development?_[^deep]

[^savon]: I assure you this is an excellent _savon liquide_ pun.
[^badgr]: {badger} has functions to generate a bunch of badges you're likely to want. {badgr} focuses only on custom badges and has some extra options relative to `badger::badge_custom()`, like the ability to add an icon. But wow, how did I miss this?
