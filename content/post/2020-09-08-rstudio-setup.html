<div id="tldr" class="section level1">
<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>R has a big online community. RStudio is a popular GUI. Why is the intersection so sparse?</p>
<p>Here I expose my setup so you can criticise it. Or learn from it. Or both. Or neither.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-were-working-with" class="section level1">
<h1>What we‚Äôre working with</h1>
<p>I spend most of my time in RStudio on a MacBook Air 13-inch (2017) running macOS Sierra with RStudio version 1.3.1073 and R version 3.6.1 (thanks to IT restrictions).</p>

<div id="theme" class="section level1">
<h1>Theme</h1>
<p>I‚Äôm using <a href="https://github.com/Z3tt/viridis-theme">the free viridis-theme</a> by <a href="http://cedricscherer.netlify.app/">C√©dric Scherer</a>. It‚Äôs based on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html">the viridis colour palette</a> by <a href="https://github.com/SymbolixAU/rstudiothemes/blob/master/viridis.tmTheme">David Cooley</a>, which is designed for people with colour blindness.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness">red-green colourblind</a> and the syntax highlighting of this theme lets me distinguish easily between the different code elements. It also helps that the colours are quite bright against a dark background. I want to be able to focus easily on the code itself, so I like that comments in this theme are italic and a closer colour to the background.</p>
<p>I also use syntax highlighting in the console. You can get this by checking the box at <em>Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Code &gt; Display &gt; Show syntax highlighting in console input</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes I switch to a light theme when writing text-rich blog posts. Syntax highlighting is less important in this instance and I find black-on-white text easier to read.</p>
<p>You can change to an inbuilt theme at <em>Tools &gt; Global options &gt; Appearance &gt; Editor theme</em>. Click <em>Add‚Ä¶</em> to provide a new theme from file.</p>
</div>
<div id="font" class="section level1">
<h1>Font</h1>
<p>I‚Äôm using FiraCode (<a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">source</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code">Google Fonts</a>) a free font from Mozilla.</p>
<p>I find it easy to read both for coding and for writing prose.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs main draw is its ligatures: it combines certain sets of adjacent characters so it looks like on character. For example, the assignment operator gets condensed from <code>&lt;</code> and <code>-</code> to a single, unbroken arrow character.</p>
</div>
<div id="layout" class="section level1">
<h1>Layout</h1>
<p>I have the console pane on the right-hand side rather than the default of being on the left. I don‚Äôt see a lot people doing this, but I tend to maximise the script and console panes side-by-side so I can focus purely on inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>You can change this setting by clicking the <em>Workspace Panes</em> button (looks like a window) on the ‚Äòtaskbar‚Äô at the top of the interface, to the left of the <em>Addins</em> menu.</p>
</div>
<div id="rdata" class="section level1">
<h1>RData</h1>
<p>There are default settings that let RStudio open from where you left off, so that the contents of your environment are intact. <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/04/17/r-self-shame/#env">I don‚Äôt like this</a> and it‚Äôs advised against in places like <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html">the R for Data Science book</a> by Wickham and Grolemund.</p>
<p>I tend to restart R every few minutes so that I‚Äôm working with a completely clean environment. This stops me from modifying objects and forgetting about it, which could result in erroneous output.</p>
<p>You can set this behaviour in <em>Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; General &gt; Basic &gt; Workspace</em> by unchecking <em>Restore .Rdata on startup</em> and setting <em>Save workspace to .RData on exit</em> to <em>Never</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="addins" class="section level1">
<h1>Addins</h1>
<p>RStudio has a system of ‚Äòaddins‚Äô that act as extensions for RStudio. They let you execute shortcuts and other commands via a dropdown menu in the GUI or a keyboard shortcut. Often these are functions that relate to the GUI in some way, like modifying selected text.</p>
<p>I have a whole bunch of addins, but only use a few of them frequently enough to note here.</p>
<ul>
<li>{blogsnip} and {remedy}</li>
<li>{datapasta}</li>
<li>{blogdown}</li>
<li>{annotater}</li>
<li>{reprex}</li>
</ul>
<p>There‚Äôs no official catalogue for addins, but see a list in the readme for [{addinslist} by Dean Attali]. You can also install it as a kind of meta-addin and use it to browse for other addins.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-gui-elements" class="section level1">
<h1>Other GUI elements</h1>
<p>From the ‚Äòmagic wand‚Äô menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflow comment</li>
<li>Insert roxygen skeleton</li>
<li>Rename in scope</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>RStudio icon to navigate to the project or package home directory</li>
<li>Show document outline</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these have keyboard shortcuts that I frequently forget.</p>
</div>
<div id="keyboard-shortcuts" class="section level1">
<h1>Keyboard shortcuts</h1>
<p>There‚Äôs a number of default keyboard shortcuts that I use frequently:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> for a {magrittr} pipe, <code>%&gt;%</code></li>
<li><kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> for an assignment arrow, <code>&lt;-</code></li>
<li><kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd> üêô to restart RStudio</li>
<li><kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to comment out a selected block</li>
<li><kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to add a section label</li>
<li><kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> to document a package, <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> to load it</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="for-teaching" class="section level1">
<h1>For teaching</h1>
<p>I revert a lot of these settings back to the defaults when teaching.</p>
<p>This makes things less confusing for learners and makes it easier to use shared language to describe stuff in the GUI.</p>
</div>
<div id="next" class="section level1">
<h1>Next</h1>
<p>I don‚Äôt really make use of snippets and I haven‚Äôt really mapped any new keyboard shortcuts. I want to look into Garrick Aden-Buie‚Äôs {shrtcuts} package (<a href="https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/shrtcts/">blog</a>, <a href="https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/shrtcts/">package site</a>).</p>
<p>I tend to use the terminal window for everything Git based and I know very little of the Git GUI built into RStudio.</p>
