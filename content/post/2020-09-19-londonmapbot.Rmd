# tl;dr

I made [\@londonmapbot](https://www.twitter.com/londonmapbot): a simple Twitter bot that uses the R package {rtweet}, GitHub Actions and the Mapbox API. Find [the source on Github](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot).

# London from (socially-distant) space

I've wanted to make a Twitter bot for a while, but it seemed like Hard Work. Spoiler: it's not.

So, I've made [\@londonmapbot](https://www.twitter.com/londonmapbot): a completely unsophisticated proof-of-concept Twitter bot. 

What does it do? It posts a satellite image from random coordinates in Greater London (well, from a bounding box roughly within the M25 motorway) every half hour. Below is an example image from [an existing \@londonmapbot tweet](https://twitter.com/londonmapbot/status/1309199157530431489?s=20). Can you guess where it is?[^clue]

<p class="caption"></p>
</div>

The code for this runs remotely. You can set it up, let it run and never think about it again.

So how does it work? A scheduled GitHub Action runs R code to generate random latitude and longitude values, which are sent to the [Mapbox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static-images) to retrieve a satellite picture. The image is then posted via [the Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) that is accessed using the [{rtweet}](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/) package. A link to the coordinates on OpenStreetMap is also included so you can find out exactly where the image is from.

The main purpose was to learn more about GitHub Actions, building on [my previous posts about using actions for continuous integration](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/08/09/ghactions-pkgs/), but I think incidentally that the tweets are quite pleasing to look at and to guess where they are.

# The components

The [source code](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot) is quite simple. There's two files, basically:

* [a single YAML file](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot) containing the action
* [a single R script](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/londonmapbot-tweet.R) that generates the tweet and posts it

Let's look at the GitHub Actions code in the YAML file and the use of {rtweet} and Mapbox in the R file.

## GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a platform for automating workflows remotely. In short, you write a small YAML file in the `.github/workflows/` subfolder of your repo, which contains instructions for the code you want to run and when to run it. I've written before about [using GitHub Actions for continuous integration of R packages](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/08/09/ghactions-pkgs/), for example.

An action can be triggered by an event, like a `git push` to your repo. You can also schedule it with a [cron job](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). I took advantage of this for londonmapbot, which executes every half-hour on :00 and :30 past each hour.

Here's what [the YAML file](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/.github/workflows/londonmapbot.yml) looks like for the londonmapbot action:


```
name: londonmapbot

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0,30 * * * *'

jobs:
  londonmapbot-post:
    runs-on: macOS-latest
    env:
      TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY }}
      TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_SECRET }}
      TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}
      MAPBOX_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MAPBOX_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master
      - name: Install rtweet package
        run: Rscript -e 'install.packages("rtweet", dependencies = TRUE)'
      - name: Create and post tweet
        run: Rscript londonmapbot-tweet.R
```

It's interpreted like so:

* this action is called 'londonmapbot'
* run this code at :00 and :30 past each hour[^cron]
* the first (and only) job in this action is called londonmapbot-post
* start up a remote machine with the latest macOS operating system installed (this is where your code will be run)
* set some environmental variables, in this case keys that will be used to access the Twitter and Mapbox APIs (see the ['Secrets'](#secrets) section later in this post)
* the steps of the job are to:
    * use [some pre-written code by GitHub](https://github.com/actions/checkout) to check out the repo
    * use [some prewritten code from r-lib](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) that sets up R
    * install the {rtweet} package and its dependencies
    * run [the named R script](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/londonmapbot-tweet.R) from the repo

I would recommend changing your GitHub notification alerts once the bot is up and running, otherwise you'll get a message every time the action executes. You can change this under Settings > Notifications > GitHub Actions, where you can uncheck the boxes under 'Notifications for workflow runs on repositories set up with GitHub Actions'.

## {rtweet}

The action runs an R script that generates content for a tweet and then posts it. This script makes use of the package [{rtweet}](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/) by [Mike Kearney](https://mikewk.com/), which lets you interact with [the Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) with R functions.

You need a Twitter account, of course, and also to [sign up as a Twitter developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) to access the API. As a developer, you can [create 'apps'](developer.twitter.com/en/apps) to obtain keys: private alphanumeric passcodes that grant you access to the API.

Typically, when working locally, you would either provide these keys as bare strings, or put them in [your .Renviron file](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron). With the latter, you can then use `Sys.getenv()` to call them from your .Renviron, which stops you exposing the raw keys in your code.

Below is an example of how you can use {rtweet} to post a tweet from R if you've added the keys to your .Renviron.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install the package from CRAN
install.packages("rtweet")

# Create a token containing your Twitter keys
rtweet::create_token(
  app = "londonmapbot",  # the name of the Twitter app
  consumer_key = Sys.getenv("TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY"),
  consumer_secret = Sys.getenv("TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_SECRET"),
  access_token = Sys.getenv("TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN"),
  access_secret = Sys.getenv("TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET")
)

# Example: post a tweet via the API
# The keys will are in your environment thanks to create_token()
rtweet::post_tweet(status = "This is a test tweet.")
```

This is basically what happens in [the londonmapbot R script](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/londonmapbot-tweet.R) too. When writing an action, the keys aren't fetched from your .Renviron file, however. Instead, you can encrypt them on GitHub and provide them in the `env` call of your action's YAML file. See the ['Secrets'](#secrets) section below for more detail on this.

## Mapbox

[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) is a company with services for mapping, geocoding and navigation, which developers can use for integrating into their apps for things like asset tracking, route optimisation or anything that requires a map interface for users.

Again, you'll need to set up a Mapbox account to get a key for using the API. While the target audience is largely commercial, there's a generous allowance of 50,000 free requests for static satellite images.

You can then pass parameters to the Mapbox API via a URL. This is well explained in [the Mapbox Documentation](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#static-images), which has [an excellent 'playground' interface](https://docs.mapbox.com/playground/static/) for you to test out your call. 

You basically modify a particular URL string to ask the API for what you want. For example, you can ask for a `300x200` pixel `satellite` image of the coordinates of `-0.1709` and `51.5065` with zoom level `12`, which is [Hyde Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London):

```
https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9/static/-0.1709,51.5065,12,0/300x200?access_token=YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Visiting the URL in your browser returns the requested image as a JPEG:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2020-09-21-londonmapbot_files/hyde.jpg" alt="A satellite view of Hyde Park in London, with watermarks of copyrights for Mapbox, OpenStreetMap and Maxar." width=300/>
<p class="caption">The Serpentine is so aptly named.</p>
</div>

Of course, you'll need to replace the access-token placeholder (`YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`) in that URL with your own Mapbox key. Rather than provide this as a bare string, [the londonmapbot R script](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/londonmapbot-tweet.R) calls it from the environment (like we saw in the {rtweet} code in the last section).

Here's the code used by londonmapbot to fetch the satellite image from Mapbox:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Generate random coordinates
lon <- round(runif(1, -0.5, 0.27), 4)
lat <- round(runif(1, 51.3, 51.7), 4)

# Build URL and fetch from Mapbox API
img_url <- paste0(
	"https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9/static/",
	paste0(lon, ",", lat),
	",15,0/600x400@2x?access_token=",
	Sys.getenv("MAPBOX_PUBLIC_ACCESS_TOKEN")
)

# Download the image to a temporary location
temp_file <- tempfile()
download.file(img_url, temp_file)
```

The code shows a `paste0()` statement that builds the URL with random latitude and longitude and the Mapbox key. The image from that URL is then downloaded into a temporary file, where it can be supplied to the `media` argument of `rtweet::create_tweet()` for posting to Twitter.

# Secrets {#secrets}

I've mentioned in this post about keeping your keys secure. You don't want others to copy and use your keys nefariously, so it's a good idea not to simply paste them into your code as bare strings for the world to see.

[Github lets you store secrets securely](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in the 'Secrets' section of the 'Settings' tab in your repo. No-one can see these, but they can be called into your code when it runs.

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2020-09-21-londonmapbot_files/secrets-github.png" alt="The GitHub website opened in the Secrets section of the Settings menu, with an example Mapbox token name being shown." width="100%"/>
<p class="caption">Keep it secret... keep it safe.</p>
</div>

Let's use the londonmapbot Twitter consumer API key as an example. First, I saved the string as a GitHub secret with the name `TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY`. I then called this in the `env` section of [my YAML file](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/.github/workflows/londonmapbot.yml) in the form `${{ secrets.TWITTER_CONSUMER_API_KEY }}`. Running the action results in the string being pulled from the secrets stash and decrypted, where it's available in the environment. Then [the R code](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/londonmapbot-tweet.R) can call it with `Sys.getenv()` when access to the API is needed.

# It does the job

So, you can:

* take a look at the [\@londonmapbot](https://twitter.com/londonmapbot) profile
* find [the source on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot)
* inspect the [YAML file](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/.github/workflows/londonmapbot.yml) that runs the action
* see [the R script](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/.github/workflows/londonmapbot.yml) that generates and posts the image

The [GitHub README](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/blob/master/README.md) also lists a few other map bots that have taken inspiration from londonmapbot; take a look at those too.

Unfortunately, it doesn't post successfully 100% of the time. You can see why by checking the actions log, which is accessed from [the 'Actions' tab on the repo](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/actions). The failed ones, with red crosses, seem mostly due to an 'empty reply from server'. I'm okay with this for now.

<div class="tip"> `r fontawesome::fa("exclamation-circle")` <b>Update</b>

Actually, the action eventually righted itself and runs without any problems now. For context, you can [read a discussion](https://github.com/matt-dray/londonmapbot/issues/4) about what might have been going on at the time.

In the first iteration of the action I passed the R code as a single line in the YAML file, which is suboptimal. I later tidied the code into a separate R script and declared the secrets in the YAML file. I looked at actions by [Matt Kerlogue](https://lapsedgeographer.london/2020-04/automating-pdf-scraping/#using-github-actions-to-schedule-the-process) and [David Keyes](https://github.com/rfortherestofus/rrutweets) to do this. David's repo is interesting from a Twitter perspective because it automates tweets provided via a Google Sheet.

I should also note that there are already [actions on the GitHub Marketplace for tweeting](https://github.com/marketplace?query=tweet), but they didn't quite do what I wanted. I also wanted to write the juicy bit with R code, which I'm most familiar with.

Do give me suggestions and pull requests, or tell me how good you are at identifying the granular location in each image.

[^clue]: Those look suspiciously like a large number of tennis courts, including some in stadia. Where could that be? The coordinates are [51.4317, -0.2151](https://goo.gl/maps/LAkdSRTkrEKHu3hi9).
[^cron]: There's a number of sites that can help you build [a cron string](https://crontab.guru/).
