# The pinnacle of visualisation

Great news everyone: I've taken the best of two stellar data visualisations and smashed them together into something that can only be described as *perfection*.

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LOcPt9gfuNOSI/giphy.gif" alt="Michael Fassbander as Steve JObs saying 'perfection'" width="100%">

Let me set the scene. There's three things we can agree on:

1. [Everyone loves pie charts](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pie+charts+suck), particularly when they're in 3D, exploded and tilted.
2. [Word clouds aren't at all overused](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=word+clouds+suck).
3. I have too much time on my hands.

With that in mind, I've artfully melded clouds and pies into the function `cloud_pie`, which I think sounds rather sweet.

You can find the function in my personal package `dray`, which I made following [Hilary Parker's excellent 'Writing an R Package from Scratch' blogpost](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/).

```{r install}
devtools::install_github("matt-dray/dray")
library(dray)
```

# Pie in the sky

`cloud_pie` depends on the `plotrix` and `wordcloud` packages and takes three arguments:

* `data`: summary dataframe with two columns: categories, and counts for those categories
* `name_col`: column containing the category names
* `count_col`: column containing the counts for each category

`data` must be a dataframe with a column of categories (i.e. `name_col`) and a column of count values associated with those categories (i.e. `count_col`). 

It's also completely untested and will probably break if you actually try to use it. So let's try to use it.

# Pokemon data, of course

Let's use the same data as in the [Pokeballs in Super Smash Bros](https://www.rostrum.blog/2018/05/19/pokeballs-in-super-smash-bros/) blog post, which is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/draytasets).

```{r data}
library(dplyr)  # pipes and data manipulation

#read raw data
pkmn_raw <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/draytasets/master/ssb_pokeballs.csv")

# shape the data
pkmn_summary <- pkmn_raw %>%
  group_by(pokemon) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup()

# take a look
dplyr::glimpse(pkmn_summary)
```

# Hold on tight 

Accept your fate.

```{r cloud_pie}
dray::cloud_pie(
  data = pkmn_summary,
  name_col = "pokemon",
  count_col = "n"
)
```

Did I forget to mention that it defaults to a rainbow colour palette and gothic typeface? The colours and pie slices are sized by frequency and match up by colour. *Sensational*.
