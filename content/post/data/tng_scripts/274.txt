Picard goes to	the replicator.					PICARD			Tea, Earl Grey, hot.	Neither man talks until we hear the SOUND of the	replicator and Picard gets his tea.

If she had... I would have			been part of your life.	Jason turns and looks Picard in the eye for maybe the	first time in the scene.					JASON			I guess that's not what she			wanted.	There's a moment of awkward silence, then Jason stands.					JASON			I think I'd like to go back to the			surface.					PICARD			It would be best if you stayed			aboard the Enterprise... until we			can resolve the situation with			Bok.					JASON			What is the situation with Bok,			anyway? Why does he want me dead?					PICARD			Years ago, I was forced to destroy			a starship that was under his			son's command. Apparently Bok			feels it would be fitting			vengeance to kill my son.	Jason absorbs this.     STAR TREK: "Bloodlines" - REV. 02/10/94 - ACT TWO     17.11   CONTINUED: (3)					JASON			I can't hide forever.					PICARD			Of course not.

READY ROOM	Geordi and Data are scanning the room -- Data has a	TRICORDER, Geordi has the SCANNER that he used in	Picard's quarters. Picard ENTERS from the Bridge.					GEORDI			I think we've found something...	Data indicates the chair.					DATA			Bok was in direct contact with			this chair for an extended			period... it is showing a			distinctive subspace signature as			a result.					GEORDI			We think he's using some sort			of... subspace transporter to			beam aboard the Enterprise.	Picard reacts with surprise.					PICARD			My understanding is that such			devices were impractical.					DATA			The Federation abandoned its			research in the field because the			technology was found to be			unreliable... as well as extremely			energy intensive.     STAR TREK: "Bloodlines" - REV. 02/09/94 - ACT FOUR     37.27   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			In order to transport matter			through subspace, you have to put			it into a state of quantum flux --			it's very unstable.					DATA			The quantum effect would explain			why our sensors did not detect			Bok's presence.					GEORDI			It would also explain why he was			able to penetrate our shields.					PICARD			What range would this kind of			transporter have?					DATA			In theory it could operate over			several light years.					GEORDI			That means the probe that exploded			could have been beamed into			position from some point outside			sensor range.					DATA			If Bok uses his transporter again,			we may be able to trace the			subspace signature and locate his			ship.	Picard acknowledges, considers everything he's heard.					PICARD			Is there any way to keep him from			beaming aboard the Enterprise			again?					GEORDI			I don't think there is...					PICARD			If he has the ability to beam			aboard, he might be able to beam			someone away.					DATA			It is a possibility.     STAR TREK: "Bloodlines" - REV. 02/09/94 - ACT FOUR     38.27   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			I'm concerned that he's going to			try to take Daniel -- is there any			way we can protect him?	Data and Geordi consider for a beat.					GEORDI			We could keep a signal lock on him			at all times... if Bok tried to			beam him away, we might be able to			keep him from getting a pattern			lock.					DATA			In order to do so, we would have			to tie the ship's subspace field			coils into the transporter system.					PICARD			Make it so.	They acknowledge, and Picard turns and EXITS.28   INT.

We HEAR the sound of the door	opening and closing behind them. Picard sees that	Jason has reached a LEDGE of sorts and pulled himself	on to it in order to rest.	He walks over to the foot of the rock-face and starts	to climb -- Jason watches as Picard expertly scales the	rockface. He can't help but be impressed by his	skill...30   THE LEDGE	as Picard pulls himself on to it and catches his	breath.					JASON			Not bad...	There are small crushed pebbles on the ledge that	Jason, being a little uncomfortable in Picard's	presence, might occasionally toss into the distance.					PICARD			I like climbing. There's			something about... literally			having your fate in your own			hands.	A small laugh from Jason.					JASON			I know.					PICARD			I came to tell you that we may			have found a way to locate Bok's			ship... this might be over soon.     STAR TREK: "Bloodlines" - REV. 02/14/94 - ACT FOUR     40.30   CONTINUED:	Jason gives him a surprised look.					JASON			You came all the way up here just			to tell me that?					PICARD			I thought it might make you feel			better.					JASON			Thanks.				(beat)			That was nice of you.	There is a slight receptivity in Jason that hasn't been	present before. Picard decides to take advantage of	the thaw. Jason has steadfastly refused to talk about	himself... but maybe there's another way in.					PICARD			Jason... after your mother and I			parted...

After a beat --					JASON			You know what she was like...	There is a tone in Jason's voice that is new --	vulnerable.         STAR TREK: "Bloodlines" - REV. 02/14/94 - ACT FOUR         41.30   CONTINUED: (2)					JASON			See a stray cat -- take it in.			See someone cold -- give them your			coat.					PICARD				(smiling)			That was Miranda, all right.	Jason takes a breath, hesitates for a moment, as though	he's not going on. But it's as though talking about	his mother provides an access to his feelings that	comes in no other way. --					JASON			She heard about the children on			Camor who'd been orphaned during			the Cardassian war.					PICARD				(understanding)			I see...					JASON				(beat)			I was only ten when we went there.			I remember her telling me about			all the boys and girls who didn't			have anybody to take care of			them...	This is as much talk as Picard has heard from Jason.	Picard is silent, listening carefully.					JASON			So she found this big house...			practically falling apart... and			started rounding up children.				(beat)			Eventually, there were over forty			of them...				(beat)			She called it a school. She got			up before dawn and she went to bed			after midnight and in between she			never stopped working. She taught			everyone to read... she grew			vegetables in hardpan to feed			us... and she made sure we knew			how to sing.				(wry laugh)			That was important in a place like			Camor...         STAR TREK: "Bloodlines" - REV. 02/14/94 - ACT FOUR        41A.30   CONTINUED: (3)	He trails off.

But she knew we needed the			food...				(beat)			So they killed her.	Simple words that carry a big wallop.					PICARD			I'm sorry...					JASON			Don't be sorry for me. My mother			made sure we were all tough enough			to make it.	Picard realizes that sheer determination covers a	wellspring of pain.					PICARD			Jason... isn't there some way I			can be a father to you?	No answer.					PICARD			My father and I were estranged...			he thought I should stay home and			tend the vineyards and I wanted to			join Starfleet. He died before we			could come to terms about it...			and I've regretted that all my			life.				(beat)			I don't want the same thing to			happen to us.	Jason is touched by the gesture... but can't shake the	demons inside him. Anguished --					JASON			Don't you understand?

Well let me spell it out for			you. I've been in trouble since			I was a teenager... I steal, I			lie, I use people. I'm a			criminal.
