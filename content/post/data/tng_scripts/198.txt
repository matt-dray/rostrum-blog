READY ROOM (OPTICAL)	PICARD and RIKER are listening to the Klingon	Ambassador, KELL.					KELL			There was a time when the Empire			would crush a rebellion. Today...			it is tolerated.				(beat)			We have enough problems on the			home planet. We do not wish to			divert resources to this trivial			war.					PICARD			You are prepared to grant them			independence?					KELL				(shrugging it off)			Perhaps.

It was my decision,			Captain Picard, to ask you to			accompany me. You are respected			by many on the council.					PICARD				(thank-you)			K'adlo. I have been pleased to			offer occasional assistance to			the Klingon people in the past.					KELL			Your modesty is human, Captain,			but I will excuse it.					PICARD			I can assure you, Ambassador, the			Federation would never interfere			with the Empire's internal			affairs.					KELL			Let us hope not. Such			interference would call into			question the very basis of our			alliance.    STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - REV. 3/19/91 - ACT ONE    7.5    CONTINUED: (2)	The stakes are clear.					RIKER			Captain, we'll be in a war zone...					PICARD			Agreed.

SPACE (OPTICAL)	The Romulan Warbird is using a tractor beam to pull the	shuttle.7    INT. THE ROMULAN SHIP	TWO GUARDS usher Geordi into a starkly lit chamber. At	one end of the room is a chair very much like a dental	chair. Various machines are positioned around it,	ready to be moved into place when needed.	A bank of bright lights shine down onto the chair from	the other end of the room. Behind the lights we can	barely make out several shadowy figures. One of them	might be A WOMAN, but it's hard to be sure. Another	indistinct figure, a high ranking Romulan officer named	TAIBAK, speaks to Geordi:    STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - REV. 3/20/91 - ACT ONE    8.7    CONTINUED:					TAIBAK			Welcome, Mister La Forge. We've			waited a long time to meet you.					GEORDI			I can tell you've gone to a lot			of trouble.	Taibak approaches Geordi and looks him over... it is	important to note he is not sinister, but a scientist	and Geordi is a test subject. Taibak has no delight in	making Geordi go through what he's about to go through,	it's just a job. He is quite casual about it, though	a certain pride in his work may peek through.					TAIBAK			Indeed we have. You are going			to be of great help to us.					GEORDI			Don't count on it.	Taibak motions to the guards, who lead Geordi off	toward the chair.	Then Taibak motions to someone else, and a BLACK HUMAN	in a Starfleet uniform steps out from behind the	lights. The man puts on a fake VISOR just like	Geordi's. Taibak walks around the man, studying him,	then nods with satisfaction.					TAIBAK			Good. Very good.	As Geordi's double starts to leave...					TAIBAK				(casual, serious)			Do not enjoy yourself too much			on Risa.	Geordi's double nods, then EXITS.8    ANOTHER ANGLE	Geordi has been strapped into the chair, head and body	held tightly in place; his back to the lights.    STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - REV. 3/20/91 - ACT ONE    9.8    CONTINUED:	Taibak nods to one of the guards, who steps forward,	removes Geordi's VISOR, then swivels him around to face	the lights.					GEORDI			Hey!					TAIBAK			Your VISOR will be returned to			you.	During this, the other guard moves a large machine into	place behind Geordi. It has an adjustable appendage	shaped like a giant wrench; the guard positions the	device so that its open jaws frame Geordi's head.					TAIBAK			But first... I want to show you			something.					GEORDI			Show me something? That should			be an interesting trick since I			can't see anything without the			VISOR.	Taibak activates the machine, and two thin, metal rods	emerge from either side of the "wrench." As their	blinking tips move toward Geordi's head...					TAIBAK			That is not quite true.	As soon as the rods touch his VISOR inputs, Geordi	reacts with a start.					TAIBAK			Allow me to demonstrate.	Taibak tabs another control and we see Geordi's	expression change. Taibak's lines are now delivered	for the benefit of the Woman who remains obscured	behind the lights.					TAIBAK			I now have direct access to his			visual cortex. He has no choice			but to see what I wish him to see.	Taibak activates a physiological monitoring system	which broadcasts Geordi's heartbeat into the room.    STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - REV. 3/20/91 - ACT ONE    10.8    CONTINUED: (2)					TAIBAK				(casual, scientific)			I can feed him any image I choose.			He will be unable to ignore it.	Taibak hits more controls, and we HEAR Geordi's heart	rate increase; see his teeth clench down.					TAIBAK			His galvanic skin response has			increased nine percent. It seems			Commander La Forge, like many			humans, has a low tolerance for			watching others suffer.					GEORDI				(tight, desperation				 showing)			Why... are you doing this?					TAIBAK			I am sorry, Commander. It is a			necessary step. I apologize for			your discomfort. Here...	He adjusts some panels. Geordi visibly relaxes, the	heartbeat falls...					TAIBAK				(to the others)			Observe how a spring day on his			native Earth affects him... he's			looking at a beautiful meadow,			green trees, birds, a blue sky...			the heartbeat slows, the galvanic			skin response drops... the body			responds to our stimuli, he is			incapable of maintaining control			of his own responses... watch as			I change the stimuli again...	Taibak presses a control and Geordi tightens up	again... the heartbeat increases...					TAIBAK			Once our work is done, La Forge			will act normally... totally			unaware of his conditioning. The			perfect tool for our purpose.      STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - 3/18/91 - ACT ONE      10A.8    CONTINUED: (3)	The still unseen Woman speaks out from the shadows; a	questioning, authoritative tone in her voice.					WOMAN			Will there be any physical			evidence of what you are doing			to him?    STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - REV. 3/19/91 - ACT ONE    11.8    CONTINUED: (4)					TAIBAK			None, Commander. That is why we			chose La Forge. The utilization			of his pre-existing neural			implants makes our work impossible			to detect.					WOMAN			How will we be certain your			procedure has been successful?					TAIBAK			I will program him to perform a			series of specific tests... both			before he leaves us and after he			returns to the Enterprise. We'll			be able to verify his			effectiveness.	Taibak cocks his head, listening to Geordi's heartbeat	which is now noticeably slower.					TAIBAK			Notice that his heart rate has			slowed somewhat. He is becoming			accustomed to the horrors he is			witnessing...	He presses a panel... Geordi's vital signs jump	again...					TAIBAK				(beat, continuing)			... so we change horrors. This			will occur several times before			we are finished...9    ANGLE ON GEORDI	he's broken into a cold sweat.10   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it cruises by at warp.11   INT. TACTICAL AREA	Kell and Worf study a star map displayed on a wall	monitor.      STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - 3/18/91 - ACT ONE      12.11   CONTINUED:	This situation is awkward for Worf; he tries to get	through it by being as businesslike as possible.	Kell is talking security as the scene begins but this	scene is not about security... it is about Kell	considering his relationship with Worf, deciding how	to approach him on a more personal level. That subtext	is present from the very start.					KELL			There have been two rebel attacks			on neutral freighters... one			Ferengi, the other Cardassian...					WORF			Both were engaged near the Ikalian			asteroid belt... that is where			the rebels must be hiding...					KELL				(acknowledges)			The actinides in the asteroids			provide effective protection from			our sensors.	Worf nods, thoughtfully concludes...					WORF			They might attack a freighter but			I doubt they would challenge a			Federation starship.					KELL				(fishing)			Especially if the Federation is			providing them support.	A beat.					WORF				(eye to eye)			You would test the Captain's word			with me, Kell? Is it because I			have no honor in your eyes that			you expect me to be disloyal?					KELL				(studying him)			It was wrong of me to ask. My			apologies.    STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - REV. 3/19/91 - ACT ONE    13.11   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			Captain Picard does not lie.			If he says there is no Federation			assistance to the rebels, there			is none.					KELL			Good. Because I have risked my			own reputation and honor by coming			to Picard.					WORF			He will not disappoint you. If			that is all...	Kell nods, Worf starts to leave... then Kell decides	to speak up...					KELL			There are some members of the high			council, Worf, who would thank			you.					WORF			Thank me?					KELL			For killing Duras. Had he lived,			there is no doubt he would have			ascended to head the council.			Many... were not looking forward			to that.					WORF			My motives were personal. Not			political.					KELL			Motives? Who cares for motives?			Humans perhaps. What matters is,			you acted that day as a true			Klingon.	This is a great compliment to Worf and he bows in	acknowledgement and exits.12   INT. TEN FORWARD	PAN ACROSS a typical crowd of SUPERNUMERARIES to find	Geordi sitting alone at a table. CHIEF O'BRIEN sits at	a nearby table with TWO FRIENDS.    STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - REV. 3/19/91 - ACT ONE    14.13   WIDEN	to reveal the Romulan doctor, Taibak, and the two	Romulan guards standing nearby. Throughout the	following scene, Geordi's manner is relaxed and	easy-going; he acts no differently from usual.					TAIBAK			Where are we, Mister La Forge?					GEORDI			In Ten Forward.					TAIBAK				(indicating O'Brien)			Who is that man sitting over			there?14   ANGLE ON GEORDI	as he turns in the direction indicated.15   ANGLE ON O'BRIEN - INTERCUTTING (OPTICAL)	as seen in Geordi's POV -- the wealth of information	from his VISOR is so overwhelming it's difficult to	recognize him. Then telemetry information appears...	reminiscent of a targeting grid. An "x" axis runs	along the bottom of the frame, a "y" axis up the left	side -- Romulan numbers mark the increments.					GEORDI			That's Chief O'Brien.					TAIBAK			How long has he served with you?					GEORDI			Almost four years.					TAIBAK			I want you to kill him.      STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - 3/18/91 - ACT ONE      14A.15   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Okay.	Taibak produces a Federation phaser and holds it out to	Geordi.					TAIBAK			Take this phaser and kill Chief			O'Brien.	Geordi accepts the phaser and crosses to O'Brien and	his friends.    STAR TREK: "The Mind's Eye" - REV. 3/19/91 - ACT ONE    15.15   CONTINUED: (2)	They don't seem to see Geordi as he approaches. Then	Geordi hesitates... fingers the phaser for a moment.	As he turns to Taibak with a questioning expression...					TAIBAK			Freeze program.	Everything and everyone stops moving except for Geordi	and the three Romulans.					TAIBAK			Commander, did you understand			my request?					GEORDI			I...

As Taibak programs Geordi's	VISOR, more telemetry information appears. An eerie	MUSIC CUE used here will re-occur whenever we go to	Geordi's POV or whenever his conditioning is activated.					TAIBAK			Now what did I ask you to do?					GEORDI			Kill Chief O'Brien.					TAIBAK			Then do as I asked.
