TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	BEVERLY stands waiting patiently. O'BRIEN is at the	console. A quite elderly man in a Starfleet uniform	MATERIALIZES on the Transporter pad: DALEN QUAICE. He	carries a small bag. As he steps slowly off the pad,	Beverly moves to embrace him.					BEVERLY			Dalen!					QUAICE			It's good to see you again,			Beverly.					BEVERLY			You look wonderful.					QUAICE				(smiles)			A lie I can live with.

But I			understand. When you realize			someone you love is lost			forever...	She shakes her head.					QUAICE			You know what the worst part of			growing old is?

Now.	Beverly ENTERS, stands near the warp drive, watching	Wesley in silence, Quaice's words still fresh in her	mind.					WESLEY				(working furiously)			Almost done, Commander.	On his computer screen is the CAD representation of	his experiment: the warp drive and a network of	shifting lines of energy forming a distinctively-shaped	bubble within it.					GEORDI			Almost isn't good enough. You			want to explain when the Captain			says "Engage," and we just sit			here?					WESLEY			Just a couple more minutes! I'm			ready to try the new warp field!				(sees Beverly)			Mom?					BEVERLY				(pensive)			Don't let me interrupt.      STAR TREK: "Remember Me" - REV. 8/17/90 - TEASER      4.4    CONTINUED:					WESLEY				(on the fly)			Hi!					GEORDI			Wes!4A   EXCLUDE BEVERLY (OPTICAL)					WESLEY			Right! Okay!	His fingers dance across the console. On the computer	screen the bubble suddenly flares larger. There's an	odd flash of light, almost subliminal, but everybody	notices it.					GEORDI			Computer, level two diagnostic			on warp drive systems.					COMPUTER VOICE			Antimatter containment positive.			Warp drive within normal			parameters.	Geordi hurries over to Wesley.					GEORDI			Talk to me.					WESLEY				(stunned)			That shouldn't have happened.					GEORDI			Ensign Crusher --					WESLEY			Why would there be any visible			phenomena outside the drive?					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Umbilical disconnect.					GEORDI			Are you done?					WESLEY			Uh, yeah...      STAR TREK: "Remember Me" - REV. 8/17/90 - TEASER      5.4A   CONTINUED:	Geordi quickly returns to his station. Wesley saves	his work, shuts down the experiment, looks around for	his mother.4B   ANGLE - FAVORING WESLEY'S P.O.V.	Beverly has gone.4C   BACK TO SCENE					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Clear all moorings. Engineering,			aft thrusters.	Geordi stabs at his console, his team working quickly,	but methodically around him.					GEORDI			Aft thrusters, aye. Impulse power			to the helm.	Wesley starts to go, stops, shoots a last concerned	look around Engineering.5    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	moves away from the starbase.6    OMITTED7    INT. CORRIDOR - THE NEXT MORNING	Beverly steps off a turbolift, heads for the door to	some guest quarters, activates the door chimes. There	is no acknowledgement. She tries again, then causes	the door to open.8    INT. QUAICE'S QUARTERS	Beverly ENTERS, looks around the room. Nothing looks	disturbed.					BEVERLY			Dalen?				(no reply)			Dalen, it's Beverly.      STAR TREK: "Remember Me" - REV. 8/17/90 - TEASER      6.8    CONTINUED:	She keys her communicator.					BEVERLY			Computer, current location of			Doctor Dalen Quaice.					COMPUTER VOICE			There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice			aboard the Enterprise.	As Beverly reacts, we:9    OMITTED									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                STAR TREK: "Remember Me" - REV. 8/17/90 - ACT ONE      7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:10   INT. QUAICE'S QUARTERS	Beverly is waiting when the door opens. WORF ENTERS.					WORF			Doctor?					BEVERLY			Lieutenant Worf, yesterday, before			we left starbase an old friend			of mine came onboard: Doctor Dalen			Quaice. I requested quarters for			him. He was assigned here.					WORF			I was not aware of this passenger.					BEVERLY			I'm sorry. I thought it was			standard procedure for you to be			notified once Captain Picard			approved passage.					WORF			It is. Please proceed.					BEVERLY			We were to meet for breakfast.			But I can't seem to find him...			or any of his things...					WORF			Computer, where is Doctor Dalen			Quaice?					COMPUTER VOICE			There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice			aboard the Enterprise.					BEVERLY			Lieutenant, Doctor Quaice is very			old, and rather frail. If he fell			somewhere... if his communicator			were damaged...					WORF			I will order a search immediately.      STAR TREK: "Remember Me" - REV. 8/21/90 - ACT ONE      8.10   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Thank you.	Worf pauses in the doorway, turns to look at Beverly.					WORF			Even if Doctor Quaice had been			injured... why would his			belongings be missing?	She answers him with an equally puzzled look. Worf	nods, EXITS, leaving Beverly alone in the empty room.11   INT. READY ROOM	PICARD is seated at his desk. Facing him are DATA,	Worf and Beverly.					WORF			Sir, I have several teams			conducting a deck-by-deck search.			It is not yet complete.					DATA			I have scanned the entire ship,			Captain. Other than the			Enterprise's regular complement,			I can find no one else onboard.					BEVERLY				(fearing the worst)			Your sensors wouldn't detect			him... if he were dead...					DATA			That is correct, Doctor.					PICARD				(to Beverly)			Could your friend have returned			to the starbase without telling			you? An emergency of some sort?      STAR TREK: "Remember Me" - REV. 8/17/90 - ACT ONE      9.11   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			There were a lot of people going			back and forth between the ship			and the starbase yesterday.					DATA			We can easily check the			transporter I.D. traces.					PICARD			By all means check the trace			log. But even if the results			are negative, contact Starbase			Command. We should leave nothing			to chance.					DATA			Yes, sir.	Picard nods, dismissed. Worf and Data EXIT. Beverly	starts to go.					PICARD			Doctor, one moment please.				(she turns back)			I'm sure you are aware of			procedures involving passengers.					BEVERLY			Of course. I don't know why			Lieutenant Worf wasn't told about			Doctor Quaice.					PICARD			I was not informed either.					BEVERLY				(startled)			But I sent in a request weeks ago.					PICARD			I never received it.					BEVERLY			I'm sure I had a confirmation.	Picard studies her for a moment, then:					PICARD			Computer, search passenger			requests.

Why?					PICARD			Doctor Quaice had been stationed			at the starbase for some time?					BEVERLY			Six years.					PICARD			It might be prudent to find out			if he'd acquired any enemies			there.	He stands, follows Beverly out.12   INT. BRIDGE	Wesley is at the helm. Riker nods as Beverly and	Picard emerge from the Ready Room.					RIKER			On course for Durenia Four, sir.					PICARD			Very good, Number One.

There is no doctor			currently serving in Starfleet			named Quaice. In fact I cannot			find any service record			whatsoever. There are no birth			records with that name. I find			no --					BEVERLY			Data, I interned with him on Delos			Four. I've known him for fifteen			years.					DATA			I do not doubt you, Doctor.			However I have tried one hundred			seventy-three phonetic variations			of the name, and --					BEVERLY			His name is Dalen Quaice.			Q-U-A-I-C-E. Whatever the records			say, they're wrong.	Turbolift doors open. Worf appears.					PICARD			Mister Worf?					WORF			Captain, we have completed our			search. We cannot locate Doctor			Quaice.					RIKER			You're not alone.     STAR TREK: "Remember Me" - REV. 8/17/90 - ACT ONE     12.12A  ANGLE - TO INCLUDE WESLEY	as he begins to realize a terrible possibility.					BEVERLY			He was onboard. I met him in			Transporter Room Three myself.					PICARD			Then it appears, for reasons			unknown, someone has gone to great			pains to erase all traces of this			man.					RIKER				(to Beverly)			Who was on transporter duty when			he came aboard?									HARD CUT TO:13   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - O'BRIEN	overseeing an N.D. CREWMAN working at an exposed panel.	PULL BACK to see Riker and Beverly with him.					O'BRIEN				(reacting)			Doctor Quaice? Was he part of			the regular crew rotation?					RIKER			No. He's a friend of Doctor			Crusher's.     STAR TREK: "Remember Me" - REV. 8/14/90 - ACT ONE     13.13   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN			When did he arrive?					BEVERLY			Sixteen hundred hours yesterday.					O'BRIEN				(startled)			That was my watch. I beamed this			man onboard?					BEVERLY			Yes. I was here to greet him.			An elderly man? Not in the best			of health?					O'BRIEN			I'm sorry. I do remember you were			here for a short while. But you			were alone.	Beverly stares at him.					BEVERLY			Was he invisible? Did I carry			on a conversation with thin air?	O'Brien looks at her as if she's doing that right now.					O'BRIEN			No, Doctor. As far as I can			recall, you came in, looked around			for a few moments... I asked you			if I could help you with			anything... All you said was			"Thank you." I said "My			pleasure," or something. That			was the end of it. There was no			one else here.	Beverly is stunned.

SICKBAY	O'Brien is waiting when she arrives.					BEVERLY			Chief, this examination should			only take a few minutes.					O'BRIEN			But I feel fine.	Only TWO NURSES are in sight.

All record			of their ever having been on the			Enterprise has been excised from			the computer's memory.					PICARD			Did they come aboard with Doctor			Quaice?					BEVERLY				(shakes her head)			No. They've been here for months.			But the two duty nurses don't			remember them. Their families			don't even remember them...					PICARD			As O'Brien didn't remember Doctor			Quaice... ?					BEVERLY				(nods)			I checked O'Brien thoroughly.			I found no physiological			abnormalities.					WESLEY'S COM VOICE			Crusher to Captain Picard.					PICARD			Go ahead, Ensign.16A  INT.

On the	move...					PICARD				(to Riker)			Number One, any progress?					RIKER				(shakes his head)			No one's seen him.
