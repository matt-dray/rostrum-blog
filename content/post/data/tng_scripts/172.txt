SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around a bright green planet.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log, Stardate 43980.7.			The Enterprise has been in			attendance at the biennial Trade			Agreements Conference on Betazed.2    INT. TEN FORWARD	A busy place. Conference delegates from different	worlds are here, including three Ferengi: TOG, FAREK,	and NIBOR. In b.g., a MUSICIAN entertains the	gathering, playing a complex RHYTHM on a strange	percussion instrument. RIKER plays three-dimensional	chess with Nibor as WESLEY looks on. PICARD, TROI, and	DATA socialize with their guests as Log is completed:					PICARD (V.O.)			For the first time, the Ferengi			are present, and I have			reluctantly consented to their			boarding the Enterprise for the			closing reception.2A   ANGLE ON RIKER AND NIBOR	It is clear they are near the end of their game, and	the Ferengi is in trouble. Captured pieces litter the	table at Riker's elbow.	Nibor makes a move, he is confident. Riker smiles,	moves his piece.					RIKER			Check... and mate.	Nibor falls back flabbergasted in his chair. Wesley is	enjoying the moment.     STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER     2.2A   CONTINUED:					WESLEY			Perfect. A queen's gambit...			finished off with the Aldabren			Exchange.	The Ferengi is still stunned by his defeat.					NIBOR				(re: the musician)			Unfair. I couldn't concentrate			with all that noise...					WESLEY			It's Algolian ceremonial rhythms.	Riker and Wesley nod. Nibor shakes his head.					NIBOR			Hyoo-mans...2B   ANGLE ON PICARD AND DATA	talking with REITTAN GRAX, the Betazoid conference	director.					PICARD				(lifting glass)			A toast to the success of the			trade conference, Reittan. I must			admit, I had some doubts when you			invited the Ferengi.					REITTAN GRAX			They made a profit and behaved			themselves. What more could one			ask? Still, they trouble me. We			Betazeds are uncomfortable with			species like the Ferengi... whose			minds we can't read.					DATA				(ever the scientist)			Perhaps your telepathic abilities			are ineffective owing to the			anomalous construction of the			Ferengi brain, which is composed			of four different...     STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/13/90 - TEASER     2A.2B   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(not now, Data)			Thank you, Data.				(to Reittan Grax)			It was thoughtful of you to			include Lwaxana Troi as part of			the Betazed delegation.     STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER     3.2B   CONTINUED: (2)					REITTAN GRAX			Her first husband and I were old			friends. And I've known Deanna			since she was a child.					PICARD			I'm sure Counselor Troi			appreciates this opportunity to			spend time with her mother.3    ANGLE ON TROI AND LWAXANA	Lwaxana's plate is piled with food, her synthehol glass	is refilled continually as she gives new meaning to	the old Auntie Mame adage, "Life is a banquet." Between	bites and sips, she plies her daughter with thought	transmissions.					LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)			It's so marvelous to see you,			Deanna, darling.				(a beat)			At least pretend you're happy to			see me.					TROI				(aloud)			Mother, we're among non-telepaths...			it's impolite not			to speak aloud.					LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)			You mean talk with my mouth full?			Deanna, please!	She does manage to laugh with her mouth full, but	Deanna doesn't think it's especially funny.					LWAXANA				(aloud)			All right, I will say something			aloud. Have you considered if			you had stayed on Betazed just			where your life might have...	They've had this conversation before.     STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER     3A.3    CONTINUED:					TROI				(interrupting)			Let's not guess what I might have			done. I love my work aboard the			Enterprise...     STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER     4.3    CONTINUED: (2)					LWAXANA			I know. But all business and no			play? You should enjoy life more,			like I do. Find the right man,			think of your future. Think of			my future...	Interrupted by Riker; his timing couldn't be better.					RIKER			Deanna, Lwaxana. Anything I can			do for you?	Troi throws her mother a look. Don't answer that!4    ANGLE ON BAR	as the other two Ferengi watch Mrs. Troi. Daimon Tog,	the Captain, seems fascinated by this Betazoid female.	Tog is tall for a Ferengi, although not by human	standards, and Ferengi women probably find him as close	to a "hunk" as their men ever get. He's talking with	his companion and ship's doctor, Farek. In b.g.,	Lwaxana LAUGHS. Farek winces at the sound.					FAREK				(re: Lwaxana)			She is as repulsive as the rest			of them.					TOG			Repulsive? I find her exotic!				(a beat)			And what an advantage their			telepathy would be in			negotiations...					FAREK			To read our competitors' minds...			yes, that would be valuable.	Tog can't take his eyes off Lwaxana. Farek notices,	gives Tog a look -- "be serious."					FAREK (cont'd)			She'd never agree to use her			powers to help us...					TOG			I'm not so sure.     STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER     5.4    CONTINUED:	In b.g., Riker and Troi move on. This is the moment	Tog's been waiting for. He moves quickly off.5    ANGLE ON TOG AND LWAXANA	as he seats himself at her table.					TOG			Lwaxana Troi of Betazed, I			believe.				(with pride)			I am Daimon Tog of the Ferengi			vessel Krayton. May I join you?					LWAXANA				(coolly)			I was just going to see Captain			Picard. Excuse me.	She rises, maneuvering past Tog to where Picard is	still conversing with Data and Reittan Grax. She	interrupts:					LWAXANA			Jean-Luc! Come have a drink and			tell me what you've been up to.					PICARD				(thinking fast)			Uh... perhaps later, Lwaxana.			Data and I were just about to show			Reittan Grax the new door			mechanisms on the aft Turbolifts.			Would you excuse us?     STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/20/90 - TEASER     6.5    CONTINUED:	And off they go, leaving Lwaxana standing alone in the	middle of Ten Forward. And, oh God, here comes that	nasty little Ferengi again... oops, too late.					TOG			Lwaxana Troi, I desire you.					LWAXANA			Wha... what?					TOG			Your Betazed skills would be very			useful to me... and I find you			attractive. I'm willing to pay			handsomely for you.					LWAXANA				(growing angrier)			I don't believe this...					TOG			You must be aware that every			female has her price.	Lwaxana is now infuriated. Almost without realizing	it, her voice will rise during the next speech until	all other activity in Ten Forward comes to a halt as	everyone's attention focuses on her:					LWAXANA			Let's get one thing straight. I			am not for sale. And I'd rather			eat Orion wing-slugs than deal			with a toad-faced troll like you.			Go find someone else to become			your property.6    WIDER ANGLE	to include a horrified Deanna. There is a pause as	everyone waits to see what Tog will do. He is silent	for a moment, then:					TOG				(oddly reserved)			As you wish.     STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER     6A.6    CONTINUED:	As everyone else resumes their activities, Tog	retreats to the bar where Farek is tossing down another	synthehol.					FAREK			Now that you've totally humiliated			us, may we return to our vessel?     STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/19/90 - TEASER     7.6    CONTINUED: (2)					TOG				(ignoring him)			She's exhilarating, isn't she?	Farek gives him a look. Is he kidding?					TOG (cont'd)			Now I want her more than ever.			Lwaxana Troi will be mine.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/19/90 - ACT ONE     8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:7    OMITTED8    INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - PERSONAL QUARTERS	On the way to her cabin, Troi encounters WORF. They	walk together as Deanna continues to her quarters.					TROI				(lightly)			Are we at war with the Ferengi			yet?					WORF			Daimon Tog has returned to his			vessel and the Ferengi have left			orbit.					TROI			I'm sure Mother will be relieved.					WORF			I hear she handled the situation			quite skillfully. An admirable			woman.					TROI			I'll be sure to tell her you said			so.	Worf leaves Deanna at her door, continues on his way.	Before her door opens, she hears a voice in her head:					LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)			Come in, Little One.	Troi reacts and enters.9    INT. TROI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	Lwaxana lies with her eyes open as if unseeing.	Unusual Betazed candles burn at each side of her head.	The room lighting adds to the effect of her appearing	dead, but actually she's in a meditative state.	Betazed is visible through the window.     STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/20/90 - ACT ONE     9.9    CONTINUED:					TROI			Mother.				(more firmly)			Mother, please.					LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)			Just a moment, Little One. I'm			at one with All Being.	Troi is silent for a beat, then Lwaxana's eyes flutter,	and she returns to her familiar feisty self.					LWAXANA			After that horrible little Ferengi			insulted me, I needed to center			myself.				(a beat)			Can you imagine that creature			talking to me like that? Didn't			he realize I am the Daughter of			the Fifth House of Betazed, keeper			of the Chalice of Rixx?					TROI			Mother, the Chalice of Rixx is			an old clay pot with mold growing			inside it!					LWAXANA			My dear, when you become old			enough and wise enough, you'll			understand. Now sit down and			talk to me. We don't spend enough			time together.					TROI				(sincerely)			That's true. I'm sorry, and I			didn't mean to be upset with you			at the reception.					LWAXANA			Deanna... you must understand,			you're all I've got. My only			concern is for your happiness.					TROI				(a tad irritated)			I am happy. Why can't you believe			that?    STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/16/90 - ACT ONE    10.9    CONTINUED: (2)					LWAXANA			I wish I could. How much			happiness is there in always being			there for someone else, but never			being there for yourself?	Troi feels the anger heating up inside her, fights to	control it. After all, she's a trained psychologist.					TROI			I get great satisfaction out of			my work.					LWAXANA			I'm sure it's rewarding, in its			way. But what about a family?					TROI			This is my family -- my friends			-- here on the Enterprise.					LWAXANA				(hurt)			I am your family, or have you			forgotten? And if I have to spell			it out for you, I'm talking about			finding a husband, having a child.			That's what made me happy. At			least until now.	Troi suppresses her growing anger, hoping to avoid a	fight.					TROI			Look, Mother. Perhaps some day			I'll marry. But you've got to			let me make my own choices...			live my own life, not the life			you'd choose for me.    STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/13/90 - ACT ONE    11.9    CONTINUED: (3)					LWAXANA				(driving it home)			You had a chance... with Commander			Riker. And look how you ruined			that.	That does it.					TROI				(angry now)			I did not ruin anything. We			became very good friends.					LWAXANA			All the better. You certainly			wouldn't want to marry an enemy.				(on Troi's look:)			But I see we can't discuss this.			So have it your way, Little One.	That really does it.					TROI			Little One? When I was five you			called me that. Stop demeaning			me and address me as an adult.	Troi storms out.10   INT. CORRIDOR	Troi's not even sure where she's going; she just had to	get out of there. And as she walks, she hears:					LWAXANA (TELEPATHIC V.O.)			I'll be home on Betazed if you			need me, Lit --				(a beat)			Deanna.11   INT. READY ROOM	Picard and Riker have been listening to a briefing from	Data, Geordi and Wesley on equipment to be used in	the next mission. Wesley is concluding his report.    STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/20/90 - ACT ONE    12.11   CONTINUED:					WESLEY			Adding preprocessors to the			neutrino counters boosted			efficiency by eleven percent.			Of course, Commander La Forge and			Commander Data did most of the			work...					GEORDI			Not so fast, Wesley.			Preprocessing the data with an			optical chip was your idea.					DATA			Correct, sir. Although Commander			La Forge and I designed the chip,			Ensign Crusher derived the			equations governing its operation.					RIKER			The point is, you've completed			our upgrade well ahead of			schedule. Most impressive.					PICARD			Indeed, Number One. Fine work			-- especially you, Mister Crusher.			We're going to miss you.	Wesley can't help it. He knows what's coming and the	grin just grows until he's all smiles.					PICARD (cont'd)			As you might guess, your final			entrance examination scores for			Starfleet Academy have arrived.				(a beat)			Congratulations. As soon as you			complete the oral exam, you'll			be formally admitted.    STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/20/90 - ACT ONE    13.11   CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			We'll have you back at Betazed			in plenty of time to meet the			Academy transport ship.					WESLEY			Thank you, sir.					PICARD			That will be all.	They begin to EXIT.					PICARD (cont'd)			A moment, Number One.					RIKER			Yes, Captain?					PICARD			Your science team is very			efficient. How many days would			you say they managed to shave off			our mission?					RIKER			Approximately three. Thanks to			the equipment upgrade, we'll be			able to complete our survey in			less than twenty-four hours.					PICARD			Splendid, Number One.				(a beat)			You'd agree that this is a rather			routine mapping mission?					RIKER				(what's he getting at?)			Yes, sir...					PICARD			Counselor Troi had the good sense			to request shore leave. I see			I'm going to have to suggest it			to you.    STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/14/90 - ACT ONE    14.11   CONTINUED: (3)	Riker opens his mouth to protest, then begins to think	it over. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad. At his slight	smile:					PICARD (cont'd)			Have a good time, Number One.12   EXT. BETAZED - DAY - MATTE (OPTICAL)	A 24th-century "city" -- technologically advanced	yet so well blended in with nature so that the effect	is relaxing and pastoral.13   EXT. BETAZED CLEARING - DAY	A secluded spot in the greenbelt. Lush plants surround	this open area, and a dirt path leads off into dense	foliage. Riker and Troi are looking for something in	the greenery. Their mood is light as they enjoy this	brief shore leave.					RIKER			I'm sure it was around here			somewhere...					TROI			It's been a few years. Maybe it			died.					RIKER			You know Muktok plants live for			hundreds of years...	Riker brushes aside some leaves to reveal an	exotic-looking plant with bluish foliage and eight	silver flowers.					RIKER (cont'd)			Here it is...	Troi joins Riker as he touches the blooms. SOUND of	MUSICAL NOTES, an alien melody.					TROI			It's lovely. I remember this			music... and all the good times			we had.    STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/19/90 - ACT ONE    15.13   CONTINUED:					RIKER			A certain junior lieutenant will			always remember meeting a very			serious psychology student. It			was the best thing about being			assigned to Betazed.	It's a rare moment of closeness for them, and it seems	quite natural for Riker to put his arm around her and	give her a warm kiss. The moment is interrupted by the	sound of a voice.					LWAXANA (O.S.)			Put the food down over there,			Mister Homn.	Startled, Troi pulls away from Riker. She gives him a	look: It can't be her! Riker and Troi step out of the	greenery to see Lwaxana supervising Mister Homn as he	empties the contents of a metal container onto a	silvery blanket. Lwaxana looks up, sees Riker and her	daughter.					LWAXANA			Isn't it a beautiful day for a			picnic?					TROI				(irritated)			Mother! How did you know about			this place?					LWAXANA			Your father used to bring me			here.    STAR TREK: "Menage a Troi" - REV. 3/13/90 - ACT ONE    16.13   CONTINUED: (2)	Mr. Homn pours glasses of some mead-colored liquid,	passes it around and begins imbibing at an incredibly	fast pace. Riker and Troi realize they have no choice	but to make the best of it.					RIKER				(keeping it light)			And you even brought provisions.			Very thoughtful.	Lwaxana passes him something yellow with purple veins.					LWAXANA			Try this oskoid. The sap keeps			it deliciously warm.					RIKER				(trying it)			Very, very tasty.				(he eyes her)			Tell me, Lwaxana, the last time			we met, you were searching for			a husband. Did you have any luck?					LWAXANA			Alas, no, but what happens to me			isn't important.
