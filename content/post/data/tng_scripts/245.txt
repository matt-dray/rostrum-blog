BRIDGE	It is the night watch -- DATA sits in the command	chair; N.D.'s man the various vital stations. PICARD	ENTERS from the Turbolift, preoccupied with the PADD in	his hand.					PICARD			Good evening, Mister Data.					DATA			Actually, good morning, sir.	Picard smiles slightly as he realizes Data's right.					DATA			Ship status is --					PICARD			No need to report. I'm just here			to do some work of my own.					DATA			Yes, sir.	Entering information on his PADD, Picard heads to his	Ready Room.					PICARD			I'd like to talk to Doctor Mowray			at his archaeological site on			Landris Two. Please put it			through to my Ready Room.					DATA			I am sorry, sir, but Stellar			Cartography has requested a			communications blackout while they			run an experiment.	Picard is a little surprised to hear this.					PICARD			How long will it be?          STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - TEASER          2.1    CONTINUED:					DATA			Another three hours, twenty-two			minutes.	Picard frowns slightly.					DATA			I can override it if necessary.					PICARD			No, no... it's not important.					DATA			Aye, sir.	Picard EXITS to...2    INT. READY ROOM	Picard sits at his desk and puts down the PADD. After	a beat, he activates his DESKTOP TERMINAL.					PICARD			Computer, display the latest			excavation schematics from Landris			Two.					COMPUTER VOICE			Library computer is temporarily			off-line.	Picard reacts.					PICARD			Explain.					COMPUTER VOICE			Library Systems have been			allocated to Stellar Cartography.	Picard frowns at this unusual circumstance.	He turns off his terminal and looks around the room.	His eyes settle on a BOOK and he decides to do some	reading. He stands and crosses to the REPLICATOR slot	in the wall.          STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - TEASER          3.2    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Tea, Earl Grey. Hot.					COMPUTER VOICE			Replicator systems are off-line at			the request of --	Picard finishes the sentence along with the computer.					PICARD/COMPUTER VOICE			Stellar Cartography...	Picard is annoyed but not angry, reasoning that they	must be up to something important.					PICARD				(to himself)			What could they possibly be doing			down there... ?	Picard's mouth was set for the tea, but curiosity gets	the better of him. He heads for the door.3    INT. CORRIDOR	Picard approaches the door to the Stellar Sciences	Department. He EXITS to...4    INT. CARTOGRAPHY LAB	The room is pitch black, lit only by the light from the	corridor as Picard ENTERS. Startled by the sudden	blackness, he stops short in the open doorway.					WOMAN'S VOICE			In or out, but close that door.	Picard steps in quickly, and the door slides shut. He	strains to adjust to the blackness as he ENTERS. With	a bang, Picard's leg bumps into a table, dumping	EQUIPMENT noisily to the floor.					WOMAN'S VOICE			Just try to stand still.	In the shadows, several N.D.'s are hunched over a	console in the center of the room. It is a three-dimensional	grid, and its faint light bathes their	faces.	Picard stands where he is.          STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - TEASER          4.4    CONTINUED:	The woman's voice carries a tone of frustration that is	slowly intensifying.					WOMAN'S VOICE			It'll take a second for our eyes			to re-adjust...				(beat; urgent)			Elevate to three-point-two.				(beat)			Good... we can do this...				(beat)			We're losing vertical alignment.			Compensate...				(beat)			Gently, don't bump it.				(beat)			No, no -- hit the...				(much louder)			Forget it. Lights.	The group at the console breaks up. The owner of the	voice, NELLA DAREN, Lieutenant Commander, leans against	the console in frustration, her back to the door.					NELLA			Whoever you are, you just ruined			four hours of work.					PICARD			You might've taken the simple			precaution of locking the door.	She turns to lay into this cheeky interloper.					NELLA			It's three o'clock in the morning --	Her face falls when she realizes it's the Captain.					NELLA				(surprised)			Captain Picard...	Picard can't help but smile at her discomfort.					PICARD			You must be Lieutenant Commander			Daren.          STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - TEASER          4A.4    CONTINUED: (2)					NELLA			Yes, sir. I'm sorry. It's just			we weren't expecting many people			to be up at this hour.	Picard gestures that there's no need to apologize.					PICARD			You're new aboard the Enterprise.			I think you'll soon learn to start			expecting the unexpected.	She appreciates his letting the matter drop and smiles.					NELLA			That's why I put in for this			assignment.          STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - TEASER          5.4    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			Excellent. Now perhaps you could			tell me what was so important that			it required depriving the ship's			Captain of a cup of Earl Grey?					NELLA			Earl Grey? No wonder you can't			sleep.	Picard reacts as she strides toward her replicator.					NELLA			Computer, bring replicators back			on line and give me a cup of Daren			herbal tea blend number three,			hot.	She turns back as we HEAR the replicator.					NELLA			You shouldn't be drinking a			stimulant at this time of night.			I think you'll like this.	She hands him the tea which has appeared, looks on as	he takes a sip. He grimaces and makes a sour face at	the taste. Nella takes it in stride.					NELLA			I've programmed seven other blends			into the replicator...				(smiles)			You're bound to like one of them.	Though still smarting from the taste, Picard tries to	be gracious.					PICARD			I look forward to sampling them.	Nella smiles, then moves toward the console where she	was working earlier.					NELLA			I'm sorry if the system blackouts			we requested inconvenienced you.			We were taking very precise			gravimetric readings -- it			wouldn't have taken much to throw			them off.          STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - TEASER          6.4    CONTINUED: (4)					PICARD				(eyeing the console)			What are these readings for?	Nella is pleased the Captain is taking an interest.					NELLA			I'm trying to construct a			mathematical model of an emerging			star system. If it works, we'll			be able to predict the			configuration of a system that			won't be formed for another two			million years.					PICARD				(a wry smile)			That's a long time to wait to find			out if you're right.					NELLA				(smiles)			I have a few things to do between			now and then.	They regard each other... off their mutual intrigue	we...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 STAR TREK: "Lessons" - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT ONE       7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:           (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)            5    EXT.

Picard ENTERS from the	Ready Room.					RIKER			We'll arrive at the Borgolis			Nebula in three hours, sir.					PICARD			I understand it has unusual			radioactive emissions -- I'm sure			Stellar Sciences will find it an			interesting study.					RIKER			Commander Daren has already			requested time on the main sensor			array.	Picard nods and heads for the Turbolift.          STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE          8.6    CONTINUED:					PICARD			You have the Bridge, Number One.	Data turns to address him.					DATA			Captain, I would like to remind			you about our concert this evening			in Ten-Forward.				(beat)			We will be performing Chopin's			Trio in G minor.					PICARD				(nods)			I'll be there.	Data is gratified to hear this...7    INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS	Picard and BEVERLY are sharing an afternoon lunch,	chatting about this and that.					PICARD			... the upshot is... we'll be close			enough for you to slip away for a			few days and see Wesley.	Beverly beams at hearing this.					BEVERLY			Wonderful, thank you, Jean-Luc.	She sips her tea.					BEVERLY			This is delicious; what is it?					PICARD			It's an herbal tea blend...				(beat)			I came across it in the replicator			files.	Beverly nods.					PICARD			Have you met any of the new			crewmembers we took on at Starbase			Two-eighteen?         STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE         8A.7    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY				(nods)			In fact, I have a new Nurse. His			name's Beck, he's an obstetrics			specialist.	Picard nods.       STAR TREK: "Lessons" - REV. 01/28/93 - ACT ONE       9.7    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD				(casually)			I met the new head of Stellar			Sciences last night. Lieutenant			Commander Daren.					BEVERLY			Yes... Nella Daren. She was in			Sickbay for a physical last week.			I liked her. Very forthright.					PICARD			Very.	Beverly suddenly remembers something.					BEVERLY			Oh, I forgot to tell you... The			Exogenics Journal accepted my			paper for publication.					PICARD				(smiles)			That's wonderful, Beverly.					BEVERLY			I'm hoping to get a response from			other scientists studying			ribosomal replication. There's			still no satisfying explanation			for the genetic drift.       STAR TREK: "Lessons" - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT ONE       10.7    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD				(smiles)			That journal is widely read.			You'll probably be swamped with			responses.				(beat)			Did you know it's possible now to			predict the configuration of a			star system that won't be formed			for another two million years?	She stares at him, momentarily off-stride by this non-sequitur...	but Picard's interests are many and farranging.					BEVERLY			Really? No, I didn't...					PICARD			It's quite intriguing. It's made			possible by a rather complex			mathematical construct based on			fractal particle motion. And of			course that's just the			foundation... the modeling itself			requires gravimetric wave inputs.					BEVERLY			I see.	He hears her polite, neutral response and smiles self-effacingly.					PICARD			Well, I'm sure it sounds dry.			Stellar cartography isn't			everyone's cup of tea...					BEVERLY			I'm sure it's fascinating.	Picard smiles and puts his cup down.					PICARD			Well... we'd better get to Ten			Forward; we don't want to be late			for the concert.	And they rise to EXIT.8    INT. TEN FORWARD	TROI, GEORDI, Riker, Picard and Beverly are sitting	among the N.D.'s waiting for the performance to start.	People talk quietly among themselves as they wait.         STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE         10A.8    CONTINUED:	A PIANO has been set up on one side of the room, along	with CHAIRS and MUSIC STANDS for the accompanists.	The crowd falls silent as the musicians ENTER and take	their seats. Data carries his violin. Another	musician will play a cello. Everyone is in place	except the piano soloist, to whom Data now gestures so	they may ENTER.	It is Nella Daren...9    CLOSE - PICARD	as he recognizes her.         STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE         11.10   RESUME SCENE	as Data gestures to the others and begins the concert.	Nella dives into the piece with amazing skill and	relish. From the crash of opening chords to the	following arpeggiated run, her performance is an	explosion of passionate color. At once, the room is	electrified.11   CLOSE - PICARD	as he listens to this virtuosic performance. He's	never heard music played more beautifully. His eyes	close as he takes it all in...12   ON CROWD	as we see that Picard is not alone in feeling moved by	her playing.13   OMITTED14   INT. TEN FORWARD	during the reception following the performance. Nella	is surrounded by admirers and well-wishers.	Data, Beverly and Picard stand nearby waiting their	turn to thank her for the performance. After a moment,	she turns to them.					PICARD			Your playing was remarkable.					NELLA				(without modesty)			Thank you, sir.         STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE         12.14   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			You're very talented.					DATA			I noticed that the applause			tonight exceeded average decibel			levels.					NELLA				(smiles)			I guess that means they enjoyed			themselves. I know I enjoyed			playing.					PICARD			That was obvious.	Data has been looking around for the other musician.					DATA			Excuse me. I have not yet			congratulated Ensign Cheney.	Nella nods.					BEVERLY			I'll go with you.	Beverly exchanges smiles with Picard and moves after	Data.	Picard and Nella are alone. Their eyes meet.       STAR TREK: "Lessons" - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT ONE       13.14   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			I played piano for a while when I			was young. But I never put in the			practice time it takes to become			truly proficient.					NELLA			That was never my problem. In			fact, my parents had to make me go			out and play.	Picard smiles. Then... something he's been wondering	about...					PICARD			I wanted to ask you... during the			second arpeggio in the first			movement, I noticed you played an			F minor chord instead of a			diminished D.					NELLA			You're a musician. What's your			instrument? We should play some			time.					PICARD			I'm very much an amateur. But I			must say, your choice in that			arpeggio was delightful. Not at			all what one expects to hear.         STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE         14.14   CONTINUED: (3)	She regards him evenly... with a twinkle in her eye.					NELLA			Well, Captain... now that I'm on			your ship, maybe you should start			expecting the unexpected.	She smiles... and Picard, hearing his own words echoed	back to him, can't help but smile back.

Nella ENTERS from the	Turbolift and approaches Riker.					NELLA			Excuse me, sir.	Riker nods that she go ahead.					NELLA				(continuing)			I was hoping my people in Spectral			Analysis could have another few			hours on the main sensor array.					RIKER			I'm sorry, the array's been			allocated to Engineering; they're			running some warp field tests.					NELLA			If we go off-line now, we'll lose			the gas flow pattern we've been			tracking.	Riker's not annoyed by any of this -- he's used to	advocacy from Department heads and is comfortable	making these kinds of decisions.					RIKER			I understand that. But we've got			other departments waiting to use			the array.					NELLA			We're at a critical juncture --					RIKER				(firm)			Commander.         STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO         16.17   CONTINUED:	Nella backs off.

PICARD'S QUARTERS	It's evening. Picard is holding his flute, listening	to a playback of a recording he just made. He is	dressed comfortably, a cup of tea on a nearby table.	The door CHIMES.					PICARD			End playback.	The Computer stops the recording.					PICARD			Come.	The door OPENS to REVEAL Nella standing in the doorway.	Under her arm is some sort of rolled-up SCROLL.       STAR TREK: "Lessons" - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT TWO       17.18   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(surprised)			Commander Daren.					NELLA			I hope you don't mind me dropping			by like this?					PICARD			I'm delighted. Come in.	She comes in and the door closes behind her. She sees	the flute in his hand.					NELLA			What kind of flute is that?					PICARD			It's Ressikan.					NELLA			I never saw one before.	Beat.					PICARD			They're not made anymore.					NELLA			How long have you been playing?	Picard doesn't quite know how to explain.					PICARD			A long time...					NELLA			I'd love to hear you play			sometime.					PICARD			I'm not very good.					NELLA			It doesn't matter, as long as you			enjoy it.         STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO         18.18   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Yes, but I wouldn't want to			inflict it on anyone else.	She shrugs.					NELLA			May I try?	Picard hands her the instrument. She eyes it briefly,	sets her fingers to the holes, and tries it. The notes	are off key and flat. She stops and inspects it.					PICARD			You're not holding it quite			right...					NELLA			Show me.	Picard takes the flute and PLAYS a few notes, simple	and sweet. Nella is pleased by the sound. When he	finishes he shrugs as if it were nothing.					NELLA			You're better than you think.					PICARD				(dismissing this)			Please...					NELLA			Really. We should play together.	This isn't what Picard was hoping to hear.					PICARD			There's... no piano here.					NELLA			Oh, but there is.	Nella takes the scroll she brought in and unfurls it on	a nearby table. It's a sheet of piano keys that	flatten out to become a keyboard. She turns and sees	the expression of surprise on Picard's face.					NELLA			I picked it up on Mataline Two.			It's amazing.	She does a little ARPEGGIO to show off. It sounds like	a good electronic keyboard.         STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO         19.18   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			Remarkable...				(hoping to get out of				 this)			Why don't you play something for			me?	She eyes him, knowing what he's up to.					NELLA			You start... I'll jump in.	Picard can't think how to get out of it. He sets his	fingers on the flute tentatively.					PICARD			What... shall we play?					NELLA			What were you working on before I			came in?	Beat.					PICARD			Bach... the third Brandenburg.					NELLA			Perfect. Go ahead.	He gamely starts in; she waits a few beats and then	joins in.

If it hadn't been for			the perimeter teams, we wouldn't			have made it.	At least Picard knows that he made the right decision --	those who sacrificed their lives did so to save many	others. But Picard takes no comfort in knowing this.					RIKER			We managed to get four of the			teams off the surface.				(grim)			The interference kept us from			getting the other two... I don't			see how they could have survived.	Picard takes this in, stone-faced.					PICARD			Which teams are missing?					RIKER			Three and six.             STAR TREK: "Lessons" - 01/25/93 - ACT FIVE             49.57   CONTINUED:	Riker senses that though Picard desperately wants to	know, he can't bring himself to ask.					RIKER			The last I knew, Commander Daren			was with team six.	Picard's face is ashen.

He stops and turns to face the chamber.	As the N.D. works the console, three figures begin to	MATERIALIZE on the pad. As Picard watches, the woman	he thought he'd lost takes shape before his eyes.	Nella is safe.	A look of incredible relief washes over Picard's face.	Inside, he wants to run to hold her, but he's the	Captain. He can't.	Their eyes meet for a brief moment before the medical	technicians take her away. But there was something in	Nella's eyes Picard can't place...60   EXT.
