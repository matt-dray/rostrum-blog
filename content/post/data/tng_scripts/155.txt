GALORNDON SURFACE (OPTICAL)	A hellish environment bathed in a BLUE-HUED light.	Cold and dusty (it is always night), the planet is	whipped by gale force winds. Visibility is only a few	feet. Crackling blue ARCS of electricity slash across	the sky. RIKER, WORF and GEORDI MATERIALIZE. It is	an immediate struggle to see. Riker lays a marker down	on the ground where they beamed in.					RIKER			Marking beam-out position.			Return transport: fourteen			minutes, forty seconds.	Worf and Riker light their palm beacons... beams of	light shoot out... it doesn't help a lot.					RIKER			Your view any better, Geordi?					GEORDI				(adjusting his VISOR)			Not too bad, sir. A lot of			charged-particle precipitation,			but I can compensate.					WORF			Communicators are dysfunctional.					RIKER			Tricorders?					WORF			Readings only valid within five			meters.					GEORDI				(re: his tricorder)			I'm not so sure of that...

Some electrically			conductive objects.	Moving with them as they begin to encounter pieces of	wreckage from a small landing craft, badly destroyed...	Riker looks down at some, reacts as he sees familiar	markings.					RIKER			Recognize the markings, Worf?					WORF			Yessir. Romulan.					RIKER			I wonder what the hell they were			doing in a Federation sector.					GEORDI			I'm picking up traces of ultritium			residue with my VISOR, Commander.			An explosive device must've been			used to destroy the craft after			it crashed.       STAR TREK: "The Enemy" - REV. 9/14/89 - TEASER       2A.7    CONTINUED:	They exchange a look.

Moving with Geordi as he continues to	follow --8    ANOTHER ANGLE	as the distance between them increases, there is no	longer visual contact... Geordi disappears into the	storm as Worf comes across a seriously hurt Romulan	(PATAHK).					WORF			Commander...	Riker is not visible... likely out of earshot in the	wind... Worf bends down, rolls the Romulan on his back.	Patahk is MOANING, delirious.					WORF			Commander Riker...	Patahk opens his eyes and sees Worf. He lunges up from	the ground, and tries to close his hands around Worf's	throat. Worf struggles with the Romulan and succeeds	easily in immobilizing the injured man. A moment	later, Riker appears, reacts to the sight of the	Romulan.9    WITH GEORDI	moving along the terrain... suddenly without warning,	the earth beneath him collapses and...10   INT. PIT	Geordi falls hard to the ground, splashing in muddy	water... his VISOR is flung from his face on impact...	he groans, stunned... reaches out, trying to find the	VISOR in the puddle, finally touches it... puts it	on... wipes it off... sees that he's in a deep	pit...	NEW ANGLE	The sky raging in a small opening many feet	overhead... The walls are slick and muddy -- not	rocky... there's no way back up.       STAR TREK: "The Enemy" - REV. 9/13/89 - TEASER       4.11   CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(yelling)			COMMANDER RIKER... WORF... HEY			UP THERE...12   RIKER AND WORF	can't hear him. They are supporting the Romulan...	moving him back to the beam-out spot.					WORF			Four minutes to beam-up, sir.	Riker tries to see through the storm... it's	impossible...					RIKER			Where is he? Wait here...	He moves into the storm, quickly disappearing...13   GEORDI	trying his communicator, knowing it doesn't work...					GEORDI			La Forge to Riker... La Forge to			Worf...				(yelling up again)			HEY...	He tries to climb... the walls are wet and slippery...	he only succeeds in bringing more mud sliding down on	top of him...14   RIKER	moving through the storm... it's getting worse...					RIKER			GEORDI...15   WORF AND PATAHK (OPTICAL)	Worf kneeling on one leg... the Romulan is barely	clinging to consciousness.          STAR TREK: "The Enemy" - 9/11/89 - TEASER          5.15   CONTINUED:	Worf, knowing time is running out, looks out into the	fog... sees Riker returning alone... they exchange	a look that says Geordi's lost. With a burst of	determination, Worf rises and starts to move away into	the storm to find Geordi...					RIKER				(sharply)			Lieutenant Worf, maintain your			position.	Worf reluctantly obeys. A moment later all three	DEMATERIALIZE. HOLD on the wind-swept wasteland as the	fierce electrical storm takes hold.16   INT. CAVERN	Geordi looks up and no longer bothers yelling.

Post guards in			visual contact at all times.	Reacting, on the move --					BEVERLY			He's not going anywhere,			Lieutenant.	Worf doesn't waver, nods to the security personnel to	follow the medical team... as they do, they pass PICARD	who arrives... moves to Riker who is with O'BRIEN at	his console...       STAR TREK: "The Enemy" - REV. 9/12/89 - ACT ONE       7.17   CONTINUED:	O'Brien trying in vain to find some trace of Geordi	in the transporter scan.					O'BRIEN			I'm sorry, Commander... There's			just no way to lock in on anything			down there...					RIKER				(controlled)			Keep trying, Mister O'Brien.					O'BRIEN				(shakes his head,				 useless)			The electrical storms are creating			thousands of ghosts...					RIKER				(sharp)			Then beam some of the ghosts up			here... one of them may be La			Forge.				(sees Picard)			Request permission to lead another			away team...					PICARD			Denied.				(off his look)			When we get another window in the			storms.	Riker acknowledges, collects himself.					PICARD			The crash site?	Moving out into...18.

PIT (OPTICAL)	Geordi examines it... begins to pull more dirt off the	wall, giving himself something of a work-table...	using the mud to shape a rough mold... he takes small	bits of ore out of the vein, puts them into his mold,	uses his phaser to melt them... steam erupts as it	turns into hot liquid in the cold mud... and as it	collects in the mold, we can see he is creating a	short, sharp pole...25   INT. SICKBAY	Beverly is with Picard and Riker... as they observe	life-saving measures being taken with the Romulan.					BEVERLY			We thought it would be like			working on a Vulcan, but there			are subtle differences... too many			of them...					PICARD			Can you treat him?					BEVERLY			He has cell damage in vital			areas... He's going to need a			transfusion of compatible			ribosomes in order to recover.			I'm setting up a schedule to			test every member of the crew.					RIKER			Will he survive?					BEVERLY			I can't answer that yet.					RIKER			Let me put it another way -- will			he survive long enough to tell			us what he was doing here?	Beverly reacts.					PICARD			It is an important consideration,			Doctor.      STAR TREK: "The Enemy" - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT ONE      9A.25   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			I can't put his life in any			additional jeopardy...      STAR TREK: "The Enemy" - REV. 9/15/89 - ACT ONE      10.25   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Nor would we ask you to.					BEVERLY			I can bring him around for a few			minutes...	As she prepares an injection...					BEVERLY			There is one serious complication.			His brainwaves indicate early			neural-pathway degeneration.					RIKER			A head injury?					BEVERLY				(shakes her head, no)			There was no obvious cranial			trauma. I'm guessing the exposure			to the magnetic fields on the			surface was slowly breaking down			his synaptic connections.	Picard and Riker exchange a glance.					RIKER			Will it affect Geordi the same			way?	She nods, concerned... Gives the injection to Patahk	who stirs. As he awakens, Picard observes as Riker	moves closer to the Romulan. Patahk is in clear	discomfort.					RIKER			You are aboard the Federation			Starship Enterprise.				(Patahk reacts)			We are treating your injuries.			How long were you on Galorndon			Core?				(he does not answer)			Do you understand me?					PATAHK			I will not answer questions.					RIKER			We must know if there are any			other survivors on the surface.      STAR TREK: "The Enemy" - REV. 9/12/89 - ACT ONE      11.25   CONTINUED: (3)					PATAHK			I am alone.

It would be like			a beacon.	Picard glances at Data for a reaction.					DATA			A neutrino pulse would send			non-charged particles back up			through the atmosphere... and			would be detectable by Geordi's			VISOR.					WESLEY			He'll be able to show us that he's			found it by modifying the			pulse...					PICARD				(nods to Wesley)			Make it so.	Wesley moves from his position and EXITS.

Any medical			guidance your ship's doctor can			offer...					TOMALAK				(patronizing)			My dear, there is no way to talk			you through the intricacies of			Romulan medicine.
