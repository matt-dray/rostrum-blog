I haven't missed a			single hour of my duties. I've			volunteered for extra time in the			nursery. My language studies are			better than they've ever been.			Someone else might have given in			-- but I didn't.					TROI			"Given in" to what?	Brooks shrugs.					BROOKS			Death is a normal part of life.			Maybe some of us are better at			facing that than others.					TROI				(gently)			Or maybe some of us aren't really			facing it at all.	Some of Brooks' composure cracks, but she does her best	to pull it back.					TROI				(continuing)			Sometimes, we suffer more than			our suffering requires.					BROOKS			What do you mean?       STAR TREK: "The Loss" - REV. 10/10/90 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:					TROI			Recovery from a great loss			involves a great deal of pain.			If we try to avoid that pain we			only make it harder on ourselves			in the long run.					BROOKS			But I feel fine.					TROI			Then why did you come to see me?					BROOKS				(exasperated)			I told you. I just wanted to...			check in.					TROI			Today would have been your			husband's thirty-eighth birthday.					BROOKS				(a beat)			You keep excellent records,			Deanna.	Troi studies her, gives her room to continue...					BROOKS			Last night. I dreamt Marc was			with me, celebrating. I held him.			I was so glad this nonsense was			finally over. Then I woke up --			Alone. And I knew he was dead.			For the first time, I knew it...	She's holding herself, like she even wants to cry, but	she still can't quite allow it to happen.					BROOKS				(continuing)			I looked everywhere for something			that belonged to him -- anything.				(shakes her head)			I forgot that after the funeral			I told them to take it all away.	She looks at Troi sadly.       STAR TREK: "The Loss" - REV. 10/10/90 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					BROOKS				(continuing)			You were there, Deanna. What in			the world was I thinking?	Troi takes a small music box out of a drawer, and moves	over to Janet.					TROI			They didn't take everything away.	Troi hands her the box and she opens it... and it	starts playing music... The sound of it pushes Janet	over the hump. She begins to sob.					BROOKS				(softly)			How did you know... ? How did you			know... ?	Troi just holds her, letting her finally begin to	mourn.3    INT. BRIDGE	PICARD, DATA, RIKER, WORF at their positions.

But something did			appear to be directly in our			path.					ALLENBY			Deflector shields are not			encountering elevated levels of			interstellar matter...					RIKER			A sensor echo, Data?					DATA			Uncertain... I have no unusual			readings, Commander.	Everyone reacts.4    INT. TROI'S OFFICE	Troi and Brooks are saying goodbye at Troi's office	door. Brooks looks as though she's had a long cry, but	it's done for now. Troi suddenly appears a bit dizzy,	gasps lightly.       STAR TREK: "The Loss" - REV. 10/10/90 - TEASER       5.4    CONTINUED:					BROOKS			I promise I'll come by to see you			tomorrow.				(noticing dizziness)			Deanna, are you alright?					TROI				(disoriented)			What... ?					BROOKS			You faded out there for a second.					TROI			No, I'm okay. Very... tired,			that's all.					BROOKS			You're sure?					TROI			Yes... Will I see you tomorrow?	Brooks is a little puzzled since she just agreed to	that moments ago.					BROOKS			Tomorrow. Thank you, Deanna.					TROI			Of course.	Brooks leaves. Troi takes a deep breath, leans for	a moment against the doorway to regain some balance.									INTERCUTTING:5    INT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON DATA	who suddenly notices something on his own panel.					DATA			An aggregate field of			plane-polarized objects has just			appeared...				(puzzled)			And disappeared.       STAR TREK: "The Loss" - REV. 10/10/90 - TEASER       6.6thru	OMITTED78    INT. TROI'S OFFICE	Troi is even more disoriented and dizzy, having trouble	focusing her eyes. She knocks a vase to the floor.	It shatters.8A   INT. MAIN BRIDGE					RIKER				(to Picard)			Recommend we run a diagnostic on			the forward sensor array. We			don't want a ghost tailing us all			the way to T'lli Beta.					WORF			I'm not convinced it is a ghost,			Commander. There may be something			there...					PICARD			Ensign Allenby, full stop. We'll			investigate both possibilities.					ALLENBY			Aye, sir.	Allenby complies.8B   INT. TROI'S OFFICE	Troi tries to reach a couch, doesn't get that far.	She clutches her head, knees buckling, as she crumples	to the floor, unconscious.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 STAR TREK: "The Loss" - REV. 10/10/90 - ACT ONE       7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:9    EXT.

There is no			further indication of the			anomaly...	Picard gives it a moment's thought and then shrugs...					PICARD			Prepare to resume course to T'lli			Beta, Ensign. Mister Data, what			velocity will put us back on			schedule?					DATA			An immediate resumption of our			course at warp six will place			us in the T'lli Beta system in			six days, thirteen hours and			forty-seven minutes.					RIKER			What, no seconds?					DATA			I have discovered, Sir, a certain			level of impatience when I			calculate a lengthy time interval			to the nearest second.

Turns to Allenby.					PICARD			Ensign, set course and stand			ready at warp six.					ALLENBY			Aye, Sir.					PICARD			Engage.	Allenby touches the console. The ship is jolted. All	are thrown from their seats and knocked to the deck.	CLAXONS SOUND and RED ALERT lights flash as they get	to their feet.					RIKER			Riker to Engineering... what the			hell happened, Geordi?10A  INT.

TROI'S OFFICE	The door opens and Beverly ENTERS. Troi is sitting on	her couch, appearing to be in much less pain than	previously, but she's still rubbing her head.					BEVERLY				(apologetic)			I got here as quickly as I could.			We've got a Sickbay filled with			headaches. How are you?					TROI			I was feeling intense pain when			I first called you. Now it's			gone.

Rather the			string's vibration.					PICARD			Vibration. This isn't a violin,			Commander.					GEORDI			Data's right. The principle is			the same. A cosmic string			emanates a characteristic set of			subspace frequencies as atomic			particles decay along its event			horizon.
