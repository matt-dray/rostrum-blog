SICKBAY	The room is bustling with activity -- it's one of those	days in Sickbay. RIKER is lying face-down on a biobed,	and OGAWA is very carefully removing some long,	nasty-looking THISTLES that are sticking out of his	back.					OGAWA			So why were you rolling around in			Cypirion cactus?					RIKER			Do you know Rebecca White?					OGAWA			The new Tactical officer...					RIKER				(nods)			We went for a walk in the			Arboretum... we sat down... got			comfortable... things got a			little romantic...	Riker winces as Ogawa removes another thistle.					RIKER				(continuing)			Then I rolled over.2    MOVE TO BEVERLY	who is scanning BARCLAY with a medical tricorder.	Barclay is sitting on a bio-bed with a worried	expression. Mid-conversation.					BARCLAY			Blurred vision... dizziness...			palpitations... a stinging			sensation in the lower spine...			it's Terrelian Death Syndrome,			isn't it?	Beverly glances at him -- she's used to Barclay's	hypochondria.          STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			I thought we agreed you'd come to			me before checking the Starfleet			Medical Database.					BARCLAY			Yeah, well.. this time I'm glad I			did... maybe we've caught the			cellular decay before it's too			late.					BEVERLY			Reg. You don't have Terrelian			Death Syndrome.					BARCLAY			You... you're sure?					BEVERLY			I'm sure.	A beat as Barclay thinks about this.					BARCLAY			Then I guess it must be...			Symbalene blood burn.					BEVERLY			No, no... I don't see anything			wrong with you at all...	Barclay seems a little disappointed by the news.	Beverly reacts to her tricorder.					BEVERLY				(continuing, off				 tricorder)			Wait a minute... there is a slight			imbalance in your K-three cell			count.	Barclay pales.					BARCLAY			My K-threes... oh, no...					BEVERLY			Barclay... I'm sure it's nothing.			Let me run a micro-cellular			scan...	Beverly activates a MEDICAL DEVICE sitting a table next	to the bio-bed, which LIGHTS UP and begins to run a	test.          STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - TEASER          3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY			This will take a couple of			minutes.	She moves off. Barclay leans over and stares intensely	at the blinking lights...3    FOLLOW BEVERLY	as she passes by a Medical N.D. who is working on	another patient. She checks progress on the patient...	nods her approval... then moves over to Riker and	Ogawa. Riker is still on his stomach, Ogawa removing	the last remaining thistles.					BEVERLY				(with humor, re:				 thistles)			You should leave a couple of those			in... just to teach him a lesson.					RIKER				(wry)			Charming bedside manner...	DATA ENTERS carrying a cat bed with SPOT in it (NOTE:	Spot should appear to be very PREGNANT). Data sets the	basket down on a bio-bed. Beverly moves to him.					BEVERLY				(re: Spot)			How's my smallest patient doing?					DATA			I believe she is doing well. Her			appetite has increased by seven			percent, and she is starting to			engage in pre-natal behavior.	Beverly gently feels Spots belly.					BEVERLY			She's getting close. You'll have			a fresh litter of hungry kittens			before the week is over. Let me			run an amniotic scan, just to make			sure everything's fine... and then --					BARCLAY (O.S.)			Doctor -- my capillaries are			shrinking!	Beverly sighs, turns to Ogawa.          STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - TEASER          4.3    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Alissa, could you take care of			Spot for a minute? Start a			preliminary amniotic scan...					OGAWA			Yes, Doctor.	FOLLOW Beverly as she moves to Barclay, who is	anxiously staring at the blinking medical device.					BARCLAY			My intravascular pressure -- it's			... it's gone right through the			roof.					BEVERLY			You're right... it's elevated.			You've also got heightened			electrophoretic activity.	Barclay reacts.					BARCLAY				(doomed)			Electrophoretic activity... is it			serious?					BEVERLY			Well... based on this, I'd say			you've got...				(beat)			Seventy... maybe eighty years.					BARCLAY			Eighty years!				(realizes)			Eighty years?					BEVERLY			Yes, Reg. What you have is a mild			case of Urodelan Flu. It's			nothing serious. Most humans have			a natural immunity to it... but it			looks like the T-cell in your DNA			that would normally fight off this			infection is dormant.					BARCLAY			So I have... bad genes?          STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - TEASER          5.3    CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY			You have one dormant gene out of			a hundred thousand, and I can			activate that gene with a			synthetic T-cell -- let your body			attack the infection naturally.	Beverly picks up a hypospray and adjusts it.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			You should be fine in a couple of			days.	She injects him with the hypospray. Barclay looks	greatly relieved -- a new man.					BARCLAY			Thank you, Doctor. I... I feel			much better now.	In the b.g., Riker gets off the bio-bed, fully dressed.					BEVERLY			Good. Now stay away from that			Medical Database...				(calls to Riker)			And you stay out of the Arboretum.	Riker smiles. Barclay and Riker both EXIT. Beverly	moves back to Data and Ogawa, who are examining Spot.	Ogawa is scanning the cat with a tricorder.					OGAWA			Everything looks fine, Data. You			want to know the sex of the			kittens?	Data thinks for a moment.					DATA			I have noticed that many humans			prefer not to know in order to			experience the surprise during			birth. I believe I will preserve			the mystery until then.					OGAWA				(casual)			I know what you mean... I don't			want to know either.	Beverly and Data give her a look. Ogawa's smile	broadens.          STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - TEASER          6.3    CONTINUED: (3)					BEVERLY			Alissa... ?					OGAWA			Spot's not the only one who's			going to be a mother.					BEVERLY			Alissa, that's wonderful!	Beverly hugs Ogawa, genuinely pleased.					BEVERLY			How did Andrew take the news?					OGAWA			He was a little shocked... but			he's getting over it.					DATA				(to Ogawa, re: Spot)			I have spent the past nine weeks			as an expectant parent. I would			be happy to share my insights with			your husband.				(beat)			If my experience is any indication --			he will need all the help he can			get.	As Beverly and Ogawa exchange a smile...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE          7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            4    EXT.

I'd be honored...					DATA			I have noticed that you are the			only other member of the crew whom			Spot seems to like.					BARCLAY			Really? I find that hard to			believe. She's such a sweet			little kitty...					DATA			She is to you. However there have			been several... injuries when			other crewmembers have attempted			to care for her.	Barclay glances around the room.					BARCLAY			So... has she picked the place?					DATA			The...

Riker, Ensign Dern and N.D.s at their	positions. Worf is working at the aft science station,	looking agitated. He taps a few controls, then slams	his fist down on the console in aggravation. Riker	walks up behind him, leans in close.					RIKER			Problem?					WORF				(an edge)			I have performed thirteen			diagnostics of the weapons array,			and I can find nothing wrong with			the guidance system.					RIKER			I'll have Geordi run a diagnostic			of the torpedo bay itself... maybe			he can find something.	Worf glances at him, irritated.					WORF				(snaps)			Must you to stand so close to me?	Riker reacts, a little taken aback.					RIKER			Lieutenant... are you alright?	Worf is on edge, and it shows.					WORF			I am... fine, sir.         STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE         13.10   CONTINUED:					RIKER			No, you're not. You've been			working for the past six hours.			You're tired. Take a break.					WORF			But sir --					RIKER			That's an order, Worf.	A beat, then Worf stands and heads for the door. OFF	Riker's concern...									CUT TO:11   INT. TEN FORWARD	CLOSE ON Worf, who is sitting alone at a table, eating	from several plates FILLED with exotic-looking MEATS	and other strange-looking FOOD. He eats hungrily,	quickly, tearing into the meat with Klingon vigor.	There is an almost feral quality to his behavior -- a	subtle but growing change in his personality...					TROI (O.S.)			Thanks for waiting.	Worf jumps slightly, startled. He turns to see TROI	standing behind him. She is dressed in casual	clothing, and is carrying a glass of water.					WORF			Do not approach me unannounced --			especially while I am eating.	He turns back to his food. Troi raises an eyebrow --	what's wrong with him?					TROI			Worf... we were supposed to have			lunch together, remember?					WORF			I was hungry.	Troi sits down and eyes his food.					TROI			Well, I'm hungry too...	Troi gets the attention of a passing WAITER.         STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE         14.11   CONTINUED:					TROI				(continuing, to waiter)			Bring me an order of... Ongilin			caviar. Make that a double order.	The waiter nods and moves off.					WORF			Caviar... for lunch?					TROI			I'm in the mood for something			salty. Besides, it's no stranger			than what you're eating.	Worf grunts a little and keeps eating. Troi takes a	long drink from the glass of water... then rubs her	arms, uncomfortable.					TROI				(continuing)			Have you noticed how dry the air			is on the ship? I wonder if the			environmental controls are set			properly....	Worf lets out a BELCH.					TROI				(continuing, reacts)			You're excused.	He ignores her. The waiter brings over two plates of	CAVIAR -- sets them on the table and moves off. Worf	glances up at Troi, licking some of the food off his	fingers... and he looks her up and down with a	predatory gleam in his eye. Troi is about to eat when	she senses something and looks up at him. She reacts	to what is clearly a sexually suggestive look on his	face.					TROI				(continuing)			Is something wrong?	Worf looks back down at his food, a little embarrassed.	He changes the subject.					WORF			It has been a difficult day. The			torpedo guidance system failed...			it was my fault.         STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE         15.11   CONTINUED: (2)					TROI			You always say that, Worf...					WORF				(a little too loud)			It was my fault. I designed the			guidance system.					TROI			Worf... calm down.	Worf takes a breath... tries to relax.					TROI				(continuing)			I think you're under more stress			than you'd like to admit. Maybe			you should get some rest...	Worf nods, knows she's right.					WORF			Yes... perhaps you are right.			Excuse me.	Worf stands and walks off. Troi looks after him,	surprised.					TROI			I didn't mean right now...	But Worf is already at the door. OFF Troi's	puzzlement...									CUT TO:12   INT. WORF'S QUARTERS	Later. The room is DARK. Worf is lying in bed,	dressed in his nightclothes, trying to sleep. He	tosses and turns for a moment, restless... then his	eyes shoot open. He sits up and glances around with	the room... jumps off the bed and begins to move around	the room in search of something... his movements quick	and predatory, strange. Worf is changing... some sort	of primordial instincts taking over...	He zeroes in on a particular spot on the floor, seems	to find what he's looking for. He bends down and	sniffs around that area, taking in the scent, making	sure it's the right place. Satisfied, he rushes back	to the bed and tosses off the blankets and pillows. He	then begins to violently TEAR THE MATTRESS APART.         STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - ACT ONE         16.12   CONTINUED:	He rips out large amounts of stuffing... grabs an	armful and takes over to his "spot" on the floor. He	throws the stuffing down and arranges it to form a	"nest" of sorts...	Satisfied, Worf lays down in the spot. He curls up in	a fetal ball and closes his eyes. Within seconds he is	asleep.	OFF the bizarre moment...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                   STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - ACT TWO         17.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:13   INT. ENGINEERING	GEORDI and Barclay are reporting to Riker. Barclay is	very animated throughout the scene, bristling with	nervous energy and mannerisms -- even more so than	usual. It is a very subtle behavioral change, the	foreshadowing of a more radical transformation. Riker,	on the other hand, seems a little slow -- one step	behind the others.

It's a tense	chase down the crawlway until --69   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as Picard reaches an opened panel -- it's the same acideaten	panel seen in Act Two. The power cable which	Barclay re-routed earlier is still visible stretching	across the Tube. Picard grabs hold of it, RIPS the	cable from the panel with a fritzing sound. The end of	the cable is CRACKLING with PLASMA ENERGY. He aims it	at Worf.	Worf keeps coming, a threat. Picard grabs the panel	cover which is lying nearby and places it in front of	him -- then he steps onto the cover, crouches down with	both feet on top of it making sure that no part of his	body is touching the Tube.	Worf is almost on top of him when Picard jams the end	of the cable into the metal grating of the Jefferies	Tube --             STAR TREK: "Genesis" - 01/07/94 - ACT FIVE             61.70   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as the ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE JEFFERIES TUBE LIGHTS UP	WITH AN ELECTRICAL FLASH. The panel cover that Picard	is crouching on is unaffected, and this protects Picard	from the plasma charge. Worf is JOLTED violently, then	he collapses. Picard removes the cable from the metal	grating... stares at the figure of Worf, who is still	breathing heavily... unconscious.71   INT.
