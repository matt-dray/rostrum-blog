SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)	The great ship circles a reddish planet. Behind both	is the backdrop of a sparkling splash of stars against	black space.					PICARD (V. O.)			Captain's log, stardate 41309.5.			We are in orbit around Persephone			V where I have been sent to confer			with Admiral Mark Jameson in			regard to an extraordinary			situation....2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD	All other bridge personnel are in place at their usual	stations.					PICARD			Starfleet received this subspace			transmission two days ago,			Admiral.3    ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	REVEALING CLOSE UP OF ADMIRAL MARK JAMESON. The	Admiral is a man of eighty, still crusty and alert,	still a Starfleet warhorse. Jameson nods briskly as:					JAMESON			Let's see it, Captain.4    ANGLE TOWARD COMMAND AREA					PICARD			On screen and relay to the			admiral, Mister Data.	Data taps his console quickly and:        STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - TEASER        2.5    CLOSE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	The Screen FLASHES UP a sharp color picture of KARNAS	in his OFFICE. There is a desk, several chairs. The	wall behind the desk is barren, save for a set of three	weapons mounted on it. Two of the weapons are	phaser-like, but of old design and of different sizes.	One of the weapons is a short pole about two inches	in diameter with a wicked-looking blade on either end.	Karnas sits at the desk, facing INTO CAMERA. He is	in his sixties, with a formal, military bearing, a man	with a good many worry lines marking his face, a man	without many smiles.					KARNAS			I am Karnas, governor of Mordan			IV. A dissident terrorist group			has taken Federation Ambassador			Hawkins and his staff hostage.			They will not discuss terms with			me. This is a crisis I cannot			resolve without assistance. The			terrorists are demanding a			Federation negotiator.6    CLOSE TWO - PICARD AND RIKER	studying the screen as Karnas speaks.7    ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)					KARNAS			I feel there is only one			negotiator with the skills and			understanding to resolve this			situation. The hostages' lives			will depend on Starfleet			delivering this man to Mordan.			Commander Mark Jameson.				(corrects himself)			Admiral Jameson. The terrorists			have given you six Earth days to			arrive here -- or the hostages			will die. Please...hurry.	Abruptly, the Screen goes BLANK. A star b.g. appears.	It, in turn, is replaced by the IMAGE OF JAMESON.        STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - TEASER        3.8    ANGLE ON PICARD					PICARD			Starfleet doesn't understand how			or why this situation developed.			Mordan IV has finally gained peace			after decades of civil war --9    INTERCUT JAMESON ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN WITH PICARD ASNEEDED (OPTICAL)					JAMESON			Forty years of civil war, Captain.					PICARD			Yes, sir. Karnas was largely			responsible for the planet's			unification and peace. Why			should he suddenly be unable to			deal with rebellious factions?	Jameson leans back in his chair, looking inward.					JAMESON			Forty-five years ago I negotiated			a hostage situation on Mordan.			Karnas was a young man then....				(light chuckle)			... but so was I. He seems to feel			I can handle the situation again.			Obviously Starfleet feels that			way too, or you wouldn't be here.					PICARD				(nods)			I'm detailed to take you to Mordan			IV as soon as you can be ready,			Admiral.10   ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)					JAMESON			My wife and I will beam aboard			at 1500 hours, Captain. Be			prepared to depart this starbase			and proceed immediately to Mordan			IV. Acknowledge.        STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - TEASER        4.11   ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA					PICARD			Received and acknowledged, sir.			Picard out.					TROI			Nearly 1500 now, sir.					PICARD				(rising)			Well, Number One. Why don't we			go and welcome the admiral aboard?12   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER CHIEF,PICARD AND RIKER	Picard and Riker ENTER, glancing toward the platform.					RIKER			Admiral Jameson, sir. Have you			met him before?					PICARD			Your hero, Number One?					RIKER			Not only mine. My father served			on the Falcon with him. I grew			up on stories about Mark Jameson.					PICARD				(nods)			I've heard all the legends about			him, too. Not only the Falcon's			missions and the Mordan rescue,			but the Gettysburg's explorations,			his command of the old Pegasus			in the Klingon conflicts....13   ANGLE AT TRANSPORTER	Two Figures are BEGINNING TO MATERIALIZE on the pads.	As the TRANSPORTER EFFECT AND SOUND DIE DOWN Jameson	and his wife, ANNE, FULLY MATERIALIZED. Jameson appears	as he did on the Main Viewscreen -- except WE NOW SEE	he has been confined to a "physical support chair,"	which greatly inhibits the physical movements of his	lower body. The chair is enclosed around his hips and	legs, hiding them from our view.        STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - TEASER        5.13   CONTINUED:	Anne Jameson is seventy, slim, one of those especially	graced women whose face still shows the looks that made	her a beautiful young woman. Picard and Riker exchange	a quick glance; the admiral's physical condition is a	surprise. Then they move forward as:					PICARD			Welcome aboard, Admiral.				(indicating Riker)			My executive officer, Commander			William Riker.					RIKER			My pleasure, sir.				(a nod to Anne)			Ma'am.					JAMESON			My wife, Anne.	Anne smiles graciously at Picard and Riker.					JAMESON			Captain, there are certain details			of this mission that you should			understand before we begin.					PICARD			Is this the place to be discussing			them, sir?					JAMESON			Why not? You and your first			officer are both here.					PICARD			Yes, sir.					JAMESON			Captain, I am not simply an			advisor. On any assignment I			accompany, Starfleet has			designated me Senior Mission			Officer. I control the Away Team			and all its actions. Is that			understood?	Picard and Riker exchange a surprised look.        STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - TEASER        6.14   CLOSE ON JAMESON	He seems quite pleased with himself -- but also	concerned for Picard's feelings.					JAMESON			Of course, Captain, you will			command the ship -- but the			mission is mine. I trust you			are in complete agreement.15   ON PICARD AND RIKER	nonplussed -- but what can Picard do? He puts the best	face on it he can and manages another smile.					PICARD			Yes, sir. Of course.									FADE OUT:                         END OF TEASER                                 STAR TREK: "Too Short...

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	underway at warp speed, flashing by on her urgent	mission.17   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE TOWARD GEORDI AND DATA	Geordi sees something on his console, turns in his	chair toward Picard.					GEORDI			Response to our message coming			in from Mordan, sir.					PICARD			Put it on the screen, Mister Data.	Data nods and tabs the panel quickly.18   ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA	Picard, Riker and Troi are in their usual positions,	with Jameson installed in his support chair on Riker's	right. They all respond with interest as:					KARNAS (V.O.)				(filtered)			Mordan IV to Enterprise. This			is Karnas. I will speak to the			captain.					PICARD			I am Captain Picard, in command			of the Enterprise.19   ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	(KARNAS'S OFFICE) Karnas is seen seated behind his	desk.					KARNAS				(abrupt, curt)			Is Admiral Jameson on board?       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE       8.20   ANGLE AT COMMAND AREA	The others glance over at Jameson, who sits up	straighter in his chair.					PICARD				(nods toward Jameson)			He is here, beside my first			officer. Do you wish to speak			to him now?21   ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	Karnas nods and squints INTO CAMERA as:					KARNAS			So, Jameson.				(squints again)			I see time has not been kind.22   WIDER - INCLUDING TROI AND JAMESON					JAMESON			It seldom is, Karnas. However,			we could save a good deal of it			now if you'll outline the			terrorists' demands....	Troi is shifting her attention between Jameson and	Karnas (on the screen), taking in the speech and body	nuances of both men.22A  ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)					KARNAS			They insist all discussions will			take place here... on Mordan. They			refuse to speak to me -- only to			you.					JAMESON (V.O.)			They could relay their terms on			your communications channels....       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE       9.22A  CONTINUED:					KARNAS				(shakes head)			They insist on speaking face to			face when you arrive. They say			they will brook no excuses. If			there are any offered, your			ambassador and his people will			die. Unpleasantly. I believe			them -- and so should you,			Admiral.					JAMESON				(pause, then:)			Tell them I accept the conditions			of negotiation.					KARNAS			I will do so immediately. Karnas			out.	The IMAGE CUTS OUT, and is replaced by WARP STARS.24   ANGLE TOWARD COMMAND AREA - EMPHASIZING PICARD ANDJAMESON	Jameson navigates his chair a little forward as:					RIKER			For a man in his position, Karnas			doesn't seem to know much about			the situation.					JAMESON			Wrong, Number One. He told me			the terrorists are desperate			enough to kill if they're crossed.			They're willing to talk one on			one, but not to him.					PICARD				(to Troi)			Counselor?					TROI			From his body language as well			as his words and tone... I'd judge			that what Karnas said was honest,			but I sensed a holding back.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE       10.24   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Perhaps he knows more about the			terrorists than he is willing to			admit.					JAMESON			Possible, but I suspect it's			closer to the mark if we said he			doesn't want to admit failure of			his own efforts to negotiate.			He is a proud man.					TROI			That could be, sir. Karnas has			established himself as a powerful			man on Mordan. Suddenly -- in			this situation -- his power is			useless.	Interrupted by:					BEVERLY'S COM VOICE			Sickbay to bridge. I am ready			for Admiral Jameson now.					PICARD			He is on his way, Doctor.					JAMESON			On my way to what, Captain?					PICARD			Just a routine medical checkup.			Ship's regulations.25   CLOSE ON JAMESON	His expression flickers just slightly, but he nods	toward Picard, acquiescing.26   ANGLE ON TROI	watching Jameson. She frowns as she senses something	behind Jameson's apparent agreement.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE       11.27   INT. SICKBAY - CLOSE ON BEVERLY					BEVERLY			Pardon me, sir, but refusing a			simple medical check --	CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE JAMESON.					JAMESON			I'm sorry, Doctor, but it isn't			necessary.				(hands her a tiny disk)			The chief medical officer on			Starbase 45 ran a complete battery			of tests on me two days ago.			Semi-annual exam. You'll find			I've been a victim of Iverson's			Disease for five years. My			"case," as you doctors like to			call it, is now chronic. In			another year, it will undoubtedly			progress to terminal.					BEVERLY			I'm sorry --					JAMESON			No need. I do not accept the			prognosis, Doctor. But right now,			I don't have time to waste, and			there's no point in you wasting			your time either.				(indicates disk)			There's your information.	Beverly considers only briefly. Commanders don't win	arguments with admirals.					BEVERLY			Thank you, Admiral. I'll look			them over.28   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	traveling at warp speed, as before.29   INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - WIDE SHOT	Gathered around the desk are Picard, Riker, Data, Troi	and Jameson.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE       12.29   CONTINUED:					RIKER			What I don't understand, sir, is			how Karnas knew you were still...			available.					JAMESON			Still alive, you mean.					RIKER				(unembarrassed)			So far as Karnas knew, you might			have been dead, sir.					JAMESON			Quite right, Commander. But I'm			not, and I imagine Ambassador			Hawkins told him that. I briefed			the ambassador about Mordan			before he left to take up			residence.					PICARD			All right. Karnas has a problem			he feels you can handle. What			can the terrorists want that			Karnas can't or won't give them?					DATA			Mordan has had peace for five			years. They have finally come			to a state of productivity that			satisfies their planetary needs,			but no more than that. Perhaps			the dissidents feel the Federation			can provide more -- technology,			science, agricultural			assistance....					JAMESON			I've negotiated many a treaty on			many planets, Picard. I've found			that peace -- or the appearance			of it -- is often a prelude to			war.					TROI			Admiral are you suggesting the			terrorists want arms and weapons?       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE       13.29   CONTINUED: (2)					JAMESON			They may. I am suggesting Karnas			is the last man to give them such			weapons.					PICARD			Karnas worked and fought for			years to achieve peace.					JAMESON			And he's not likely to throw it			away... even for the lives of the			hostages.					TROI			I see. You believe Karnas won't			negotiate on that point, so the			terrorists demanded an outside			negotiator.					JAMESON			I know Karnas. He is a warrior...			he lives for challenge. These			people have insulted his honor			by taking the embassy staff			hostage. I'll negotiate -- but			I'll have to be very careful in			handling Karnas. He'll want			revenge for that insult.	He looks around at them challengingly, daring them to	debate it. No one cares to argue with the expert, but	Troi still studies Jameson with particular interest.30   INT. JAMESON QUARTERS - ANNE AND JAMESON	Anne is straightening out the final details of their	quarters, putting away clothing items, etc. As Jameson	ROLLS IN, seated in the support chair:					ANNE				(mildly teasing)			... You're late. Couldn't get away			from the bridge?					JAMESON			Didn't want to. It feels good			to be on one again.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE       14.30   CONTINUED:					ANNE				(going to him)			I'm glad, Mark.				(touches chair)			Do you want me to help you up?	Jameson waves her off, opens the front of the chair,	and lifts himself out of it into a regular chair. Anne	stares at him, somewhat surprised.					ANNE			You're stronger today...					JAMESON			I'm fine. Feel like a kid again.	Anne touches his face gently, smiling at him. Sure --	there are the good days. She pecks him on the cheek,	turns away to put away some final item.					ANNE			This ship is magnificent. Pity			we didn't have them twenty, thirty			years ago. We could have been			together almost all of your			career.31   CLOSE ON JAMESON	as her voice comes OVER, we see he is beginning to feel	pain... gradually at first, and then getting worse... and	worse.					ANNE (V.O.)			It's so good to be able to be with			you now.32   TWO SHOT	A GASP from Jameson as he can no longer contain the	pain. Anne swings around sharply, hurries to him.					ANNE			Mark! I'll call Sickbay --	His hand shoots out and traps her wrist, nailing her in	place.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE       15.32   CONTINUED:					JAMESON			No! There's no need. It's			happened before --					ANNE			When? You haven't said anything			--					JAMESON			It'll pass... give me a moment....	She watches him, concerned, caring. And the pain does	die away from his face, loosening its grip. His hand	on her arm loosens, too; and she absently rubs her	wrist where his fingers dug in and left deep red marks.	She's more worried about him than herself.					JAMESON				(continuing)			See... I'm better. It's going			away.					ANNE			What is it? Do the doctors know?					JAMESON			Just body changes... My last			checkup, they said I'd have to			expect it.	He notices she is still rubbing her arm, and he reaches	out to touch her gently.					ANNE			You're sure? Don't lie to me.					JAMESON			I'm sure.	He holds out his arms, and she bends into his embrace.	They hold each other very tightly -- old lovers still	in love.33   INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - TWO SHOT - BEVERLY ANDPICARD					BEVERLY			... All the medical information			the admiral provided is			satisfactory, sir....       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE       16.33   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(it's routine)			Excellent, Doctor --					BEVERLY				(overriding)			Except for one thing.	Picard gives her an inquiring look and waits for it.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			The test results he gave me aren't			two days old, they're two months			old. The medical file coder			always includes the date as part			of the file number. He lied to			me, sir -- and I don't know why.					PICARD			He is eighty years old, Doctor.			For some, the memory begins to			fail....					BEVERLY			He suffers from Iverson's Disease,			sir. It affects the body -- not			the mind. I just have a gut			feeling he's hiding something.					PICARD			I'd expect that observation from			Counselor Troi, but --				(on her sharp look)			I respect your opinion, Doctor.			And I'll want you on the bridge			for the next day or so. The			admiral has to remain in the best			of health for these negotiations.			He might require your services.	The level look he exchanges with her tells her a lot.	Picard respects her judgment -- and he's uneasy about	the situation. She nods to him, she'll go with it.34   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The great ship travels by at warp speed.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE       17.34   CONTINUED:					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's personal log... I am			puzzled and somewhat concerned			by the dating error Admiral			Jameson made on his medical			records.35   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA	All regulars at their stations, Jameson in the support	chair surveying information at Science Station 2, near	Worf. Beverly is seated on the guest bench near Troi.					PICARD				(rises, turns to				 Jameson)			Admiral, we're approaching the			Idini Star Cluster. Would you			like to take the Conn as we make			transit?36   ANGLE ON JAMESON	He turns slightly in the chair and smiles at Picard.					JAMESON			Thank you, Captain. I would.	And then he swings away the enclosing front section of	the support chair, rises and walks toward the ramp.37   INTERCUT REACTIONS - ALL KEY BRIDGE PERSONNEL	staring at Jameson as he moves a little unsteadily but	entirely on his own down the ramp. Halfway down, he	stumbles slightly, and Riker reaches out a hand to him.	Jameson waves him away, regains his balance and MOVES	ACROSS to Picard.38   ANGLE ON BEVERLY	She is frowning deeply, not liking what she sees.39   AT THE COMMAND CHAIR	Picard reins in his surprise, quickly collects himself.	Jameson is grinning, pleased with his feat.       STAR TREK: "Too Short...

Quite.	Jameson shoots a look at Beverly, nods to her.					JAMESON			Neglected to mention... I began			some new therapy before I left.			Seems to be working. I haven't			felt this good since the last time			I was in space. The Gettysburg.			All I needed to get me out of that			chair was the thought of walking			the decks in command of a starship			again.	Beverly stares at him, impassive -- and not buying	it.					PICARD			Admiral... you only have the Conn			temporarily.					JAMESON				(laughs lightly)			Figure of speech.

CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD, BEVERLY	Picard has led the doctor into the room; Beverly is	still disturbed by what has happened. As the door	closes behind them, Picard turns to face her.					PICARD			The admiral displayed a remarkable			improvement out there, wouldn't			you say?					BEVERLY			Captain, no one recovers from			Iverson's Disease. There is no			known cure, and there are no cases			where it has gone into remission.			I haven't heard of any new			therapy that would have results			like this.					PICARD			Then how do you account for it?					BEVERLY			I can't. All I can tell you is			that the admiral has been confined			to the support chair for four			years by the effects of Iverson's.			By all the medical facts we know,			he should never have walked again.	Picard considers that, finally looks up at her.					PICARD			I'd like you to look into it,			Doctor. Thoroughly.					BEVERLY			Yes, sir.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO       20.42   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	traveling at high warp.43   INT.

She comes into the main room from the	bedroom area as:					ANNE			I don't know how much more			information you think you can get			out of that tape.	He rises, walks easily toward her, still in DIM LIGHT.	Anne stops, staring at him.					ANNE			Mark... ? My God... what happened?					JAMESON			It's a new therapy I've been			taking. It's -- working, Anne.					ANNE				(runs to him)			Oh, Mark!	He puts his arms around her, gives her a warm kiss.	In fact, as she responds, his kiss gets warmer. His	hands move toward a more intimate position. Anne pulls	back slightly, surprised by the sudden sensuality from	him.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO       21.45   CONTINUED:					ANNE			Mark... ?					JAMESON			I told you I just needed to get			back into space again.					ANNE				(studies him)			You're really looking much			better....					JAMESON			It's the new treatment.46   EMPHASIZING ANNE	She is frowning a little.					ANNE			No... come here....					JAMESON				(makes another grab for				 her)			I hope you're heading for the			bedroom.					ANNE			Stop it, Mark.	She takes his hand, leads him into the brighter area	of the room where a mirror hangs on the wall. As he	COMES INTO BRIGHTER LIGHT, WE SEE far more changes	about him than just the smoother walk. His hair has	darkened, lost some of the gray. Some of the deep	wrinkles in his face have softened. Anne moves	Jameson in front of the mirror and, in this brighter	light, she stares at him in shock.					ANNE			Mark, you look like you did twenty			years ago.					JAMESON				(laughs)			You're flattering me.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO       22.47   TWO SHOT	Anne looks up at him, frightened and angry.					ANNE			Mark, what the hell is going on?					JAMESON			I don't know what --	He suddenly breaks off, nearly falls to the floor,	wracked with intense pain. As an anguished CRY escapes	him, Anne reaches out to him.					ANNE			Mark!	Jameson goes to his knees, then collapses on his side.	Anne runs to the companel and activates it, near panic.					ANNE				(continuing)			Sickbay! Medical emergency in			the admiral's quarters!	Anne looks back at Jameson, who is curled into an	almost fetal position on the floor, still wracked with	intense pain. As he CRIES OUT AGAIN:48   INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - BEVERLY AND PICARD	The Captain is looking over her shoulder at the Viewer	(o.s.). It is flashing up confirming information as	she talks:					BEVERLY				(frowning)			I've found traces of chemical			substances in his blood and tissue			samples, but none of them are in			our pharmacopeia. We're still			working on alien references to			substances like these. All I can			say is that he ingested something			that's strongly affecting his			body.					PICARD			Specifics, Doctor.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO       23.48   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Captain, there are so many things			going on here, I can't be positive			without a lot more tests.					PICARD			Give me what you have now.					BEVERLY			His red cell count is running			riot. Then there's the cellular			structure of his body tissue.			It's -- changing. I can't even			begin on that until I see what			it's changing to. His DNA is all			skewed. I don't know how it's			possible, but he even looks			younger. And Captain... there			is absolutely no sign of Iverson's			Disease.					PICARD			You said there is no cure for			Iverson's.					BEVERLY				(shakes head)			None we know of. Whatever else			these substances are doing to his			body, at least they've done that			for him. But how or why, I can't			say on the information I have now.					PICARD			Get me some answers, Doctor. As			soon as possible.					BEVERLY			Yes, sir.	Picard STRIDES OUT, and Beverly looks after him,	crinkles her nose slightly. Easy for him to say.49   INT. JAMESONS' QUARTERS - ANGLE AT THE DOOR	as Picard ENTERS. Anne comes to meet him, concerned	and frightened -- more than we'd expect her to be.					ANNE			Captain....       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO       24.49   CONTINUED:					PICARD			There are some questions I have			to ask the admiral, Mrs. Jameson.					JAMESON (O.S.)			Ask away. There's nothing to hide			now.	Picard looks o.s. at the man standing in the doorway to	the bedroom -- and goes rigid.50   CLOSE ON JAMESON	He now looks like a man in his fifties -- vital,	strong, still ready to take on the world.51   WIDER - TO INCLUDE PICARD, ANNE					PICARD				(recovers himself)			Admiral -- in addition to your			rank, you are a particularly			valuable commodity just now.			Starfleet has a right to some			answers.	Jameson shrugs, gestures toward a group of chairs.	Picard and Anne follow him there as:					JAMESON			I'd been planning this for a long			time -- ever since I learned I			had Iverson's Disease. Since it			put me in that chair.	From her expression, this is news to Anne.					ANNE			What did you do, Mark?52   CLOSER ON THE GROUP	as they sit.       STAR TREK: "Too Short... " - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO       25.52   CONTINUED:					JAMESON			There's a planet in the Cerberus			system -- Cerberus II -- they say			the natives have a process that			rejuvenates the body... gives you			your youth back.					PICARD			I've heard that story, too. It's			a myth.					JAMESON			It's true, Picard. I'm the living			proof. Oh, it's dangerous -- the			mortality rate is high -- and it's			painful.				(ruefully)			Very painful. Aliens are seldom			allowed to obtain the process,			but I managed it. I negotiated			a treaty for Cerberus II several			years ago, and they felt obligated			to honor my request for the			process.					PICARD				(studies him)			Obviously it works rapidly. How			does it work?					JAMESON			The herb and drug combinations			are self-administered... slowly,			over a period of two years. Every			response is different, depending			on a being's DNA.				(to Anne)			I got enough for both of us, Anne			-- but I had to test it on myself			first. I couldn't risk you. If			I died... well, I was half a man			anyway, to what did it matter... ?					ANNE			It would matter to me.       STAR TREK: "Too Short...

It was almost undetectable,			but the improvement was there.			Then this hostage situation came			up, and I knew I'd have to be at			my peak to deal with it. I			didn't have time to wait for the			drugs to work naturally --					PICARD			You took the whole dose.					JAMESON			I took both of them. And look			at me! Annie, look at me. I'm			strong, alert, I'm fit. I'm			fitter than you are, Picard. And			I'm getting younger!					PICARD			The only question I have, Admiral,			is why you felt it necessary to			be young to negotiate the hostage			release. Surely Karnas requested			you because of your age and			experience.	Jameson stares at him -- then glances away, his face	flushing. He doesn't have an answer. Picard sighs,	rises.					PICARD			I'll be on the bridge, Admiral,			if you wish to talk further.	Picard EXITS.53   CLOSE ON ANNE					ANNE			Why didn't you tell me, Mark?			We've always been honest with each			other -- until now.	CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS TO INCLUDE JAMESON as he faces her	bitter anger. The visible difference in their ages	is very apparent here.					JAMESON			Annie, I did it for us.       STAR TREK: "Too Short...

Did you think about me at			all?					JAMESON			I got enough of the dosage for			both of us....					ANNE			But you never asked if I wanted			it. It's just like you, Mark,			to assume that what you felt was			right was the only answer.					JAMESON			It was the right answer for me.			It was killing you, having to take			care of an invalid. What good			was I to you? Annie -- we can			be together again....	He takes her in his arms, tries to kiss her	passionately. She exerts a strong, angry effort and	pushes him away.					ANNE			Let me go!					JAMESON			I can get another supply of the			drug for you --	Anne SOBS IN ANGER -- he just doesn't get it -- and she	runs into the bedroom. The door slides closed behind	her. Jameson is angry at her behavior. He slaps his	open palm on a piece of nearby furniture, heads rapidly	for the door.54   INT.

CONFERENCE LOUNGE - ON JAMESON					JAMESON			Karnas must have tried to			negotiate with the terrorists			before he was forced to call on			me. I want all the information			he has access to.57   INTERCUT BETWEEN PICARD ON BRIDGE AND JAMESON ASNEEDED					PICARD			You said he was a proud man...			probably sensitive about his			failure to deal with the			situation. Is it wise to press			him on this?					JAMESON			I'm the negotiator, Picard.			Karnas will have to cooperate			with me and the terrorists, and			damn his sensitivities.					PICARD			Then I suggest a secured channel,			Admiral.       STAR TREK: "Too Short...

It's almost as			though the forty-five years			between never happened....	Jameson stiffens and stares at the image on the viewer,	suddenly realizing what this is about.					JAMESON			You've never forgiven me.					KARNAS			Should I have -- after the legacy			of war you left us in your last			"negotiation?"					JAMESON			There are no dissidents, are			there? No terrorists. You have			the hostages.					KARNAS			And if I have? You're coming to			Mordan, Jameson.

Generally, I'd call			Admiral Jameson a healthy			man... about forty-five... in			excellent physical condition.					PICARD			What about his mind?					BEVERLY			The same. Brain scan reveals all			cells and tissue are changing,			but healthy. No loss of			memory... exellent grasp of facts.      STAR TREK: "Too Short...

I sense that			gives him great satisfaction.			When he came aboard, he seemed			hopeful, eager. Now there seems			to be a harder, more forceful			attitude... ambition....					PICARD			More of a young man's attitude,			I'd say. Aggressive... going right			for the throat of a situation			instead of considering the			alternatives.					TROI			Part of that is ambition too.			He wants to be the man he once			was.

His eyes are on Karnas.					PICARD			You'll have to deal with me,			Karnas. Whatever you wanted from			Jameson isn't possible any more.	Karnas leans against his desk, stares around at the old	soldiers who had come to share his moment of triumph	over their legendary enemy.

You			blamed your war on Jameson, and			there's no doubt he had a lot to			do with it. But you had the			weapons, and you used them.

Somehow... it is you.	Suddenly, Karnas twists away, reaches for the wall	behind his desk and the weapons there. He grabs one	of the phasers and raises it, aiming it at Jameson's	heart.					KARNAS				(continuing)			Then die by one of your own			weapons!	Everyone else is frozen by the moment. The boy/man	simply stands there, still shuddering from the terrible	changes going on in his body, but not afraid.
