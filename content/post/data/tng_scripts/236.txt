OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Riker, DATA, and TROI are seated around the table,	listening to Admiral Nechayev as she paces about the	room. Nechayev's attitude is clipped and to the	point... she has no time for niceties here. Riker and	the others are a little off-balance as they play catch-up	in this rapidly changing situation.					NECHAYEV			The Cardassian forces which were			recently withdrawn from the			Bajoran sector, have been			redeployed along the Federation			border. They've mobilized three			divisions of ground troops... and			their subspace communications have			increased by fifty percent. We			believe they're preparing for an			incursion into Federation space.					RIKER			Are the Cardassians really ready			for war?					NECHAYEV			I didn't say war, Commander. I			said incursion. Our intelligence			reports suggest they'll try to			seize one of the disputed systems			along the border. We think			they're gambling that the			Federation won't actually go to			war over one system.					TROI			Will we?	There's an ominous beat before Nechayev answers.					NECHAYEV			I hope we won't need to make that			decision.					(MORE)   STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. I" - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT ONE   3.3    CONTINUED:					NECHAYEV (Cont'd)				(beat)			We've decided to send the			Enterprise to meet with a			Cardassian representative and open			talks. We're hoping that the			presence of the Federation			flagship on the border will send			a message to their leadership			about how seriously we view this			situation.					RIKER			Where is Captain Picard?	Nechayev gives him a very direct look. Clearly this is	not a subject she wishes to pursue.					NECHAYEV			The Captain, your Chief Medical			Officer, and Security Chief have			been... reassigned.				(quickly shutting down				 questions)			That's all I can tell you for now.	All this is clearly unsettling to the Enterprise	officers, but Nechayev simply continues.					NECHAYEV			Do any of you know Edward Jellico?	They glance at each other.					DATA			He is the commanding officer of			the Cairo.					RIKER			I've heard of him. But I don't			think any of us have ever --					NECHAYEV			I'm giving him command of the			Enterprise this afternoon.	There are startled reactions from around the table.					NECHAYEV			Captain Jellico helped to			negotiate the original armistice			two years ago and I believe he is			the most qualified person to lead			this mission.   STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. I" - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT ONE   4.3    CONTINUED: (2)	Nechayev's look and tone of voice leave little room for	argument.					NECHAYEV			The change of command will take			place at thirteen hundred hours.			Thank you.	There is a beat, then everyone begins to EXIT. Riker	stops Nechayev.					RIKER			Admiral...	Nechayev stops, but Riker waits until everyone else has	left the room.					RIKER			With all due respect... it isn't			necessary to give Captain Jellico			command of the Enterprise in order			to conduct a negotiation.					NECHAYEV				(flatly)			I disagree. The Enterprise will			be in a dangerous situation and I			want someone on the Bridge who has			a great deal of experience with			the Cardassians. No offense			Commander, but that's not you.	Nechayev EXITS, leaving a very disturbed Riker alone in	the room.                                             CUT TO:4    INT.

Worf looks back down the tunnel while	Beverly quickly pulls a DEVICE out of her pack and sets	it on the ground. Worf FIRES a blast down the tunnel	into the darkness as Beverly activates the unit and a	FORCEFIELD FLASHES into effect, covering the width of	the tunnel.  STAR TREK: "Chain of Command, Pt.

She's extremely fatigued	and frustrated.					WORF			Captain... it would be helpful to			know something about our mission.					PICARD			Mister Worf... I have my orders.			I'm sure you understand.	Worf nods. Picard moves to the device Beverly attached	to the rock face.   STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt.

You have to position			the emitter array so that it			blocks the entire passageway or			it's useless.	Beverly's irritation is starting to show.					BEVERLY			Sorry. I guess I was paying too			much attention to getting away			from that last Cardassian. Or			maybe it was the phaser blasts...			or the falling rocks...	Picard realizes he's pushing them pretty hard and he	backs off for the moment. He moves in closer to	them... trying to rally his tired troops.					PICARD			I know this is difficult. But for			now, all I can do is ask you to			trust me.	Beverly wearily looks into Picard's eyes... and finds	that she has no choice but to trust him.					BEVERLY			All right. Let's do it again.	She gets to her feet as Picard smiles.					PICARD			Mister Worf, time Doctor Crusher			and me through the first tunnel.				(with a smile)			We'll pick up those five seconds			this time.	Beverly and Picard start to run back down the tunnel.                                             CUT TO:7    EXT.

But a Galaxy-class			ship... that's something special.			I can understand why you've turned			down a ship of your own to remain			aboard.	The issue is more complex than that, but Jellico	doesn't seem to be interested in lengthy conversation.					RIKER			Yes, sir.					JELLICO			How many duty watches does the			crew stand?					RIKER			We're on a standard three shift			rotation.  STAR TREK: "Chain of Command, Pt.

He's a man who's used to making instant	decisions.					JELLICO			I'd like to change that to four			starting tonight. I'd also like			to examine your duty roster and			crew evaluations as soon as			possible.

Fortunately, I still			have time to prepare the ship and			crew for the task ahead.16   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Jellico is standing at the Tactical station with Riker	and Data. There is one N.D. CREWMEMBER at an aft	station and another CREWMEMBER standing by to take over	Tactical.					JELLICO				(to Riker)			I want you to install a bypass			between the main phaser array and			the secondary generators.				(taps something on				 panel)			I also want to run the main			deflector pathway through the warp			power grid and the auxiliary			conduits through the lateral			relays. You may have to			reconfigure the transfer			interface.					DATA			The transfer interface is not			designed for that configuration.			It will take seven hours to make			the changes.					RIKER			Sir... you may not be aware that			our normal interface already			routes auxiliary power through			three separate relays.  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. I" - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT TWO  15.16   CONTINUED:					JELLICO				(blunt)			I'm aware of your current systems			design. It's not good enough. If			these negotiations fail, we could			find ourselves in a war zone. If			that happens I want to be loaded			for bear.					RIKER			I'll get right on it, sir.					JELLICO				(smiles)			Good.	Jellico briskly moves to another science station with	Riker.					JELLICO			These stations should be devoted			to damage-control and weapons			status from now on. See that			they're manned on every shift.					RIKER			Aye, sir.					JELLICO			Mister Data, how long until we			reach the rendezvous point?					DATA			We will arrive in fifty-two hours,			thirty-one minutes, sir.	Jellico starts heading for the Turbolift.  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt.

He was awful.				(beat)			But I was worse.	Jellico cocks his head to the side, listening for a	moment.					JELLICO			Check the EPS power distributor,			it sounds like you've got some			kind of fluctuation.					GEORDI				(listens)			I don't hear anything.	Jellico looks back at him.					GEORDI			I'll check it, sir.	They crawl out of the horizontal tube and then head up	the ladder.17   INT. ENGINEERING	Jellico ENTERS by climbing up through the Jeffries	Tube, with Geordi close behind. Jellico, as usual, is	moving quickly and efficiently while Geordi struggles	to make notes on his PADD and answer Jellico's	questions. Data is also here.					JELLICO			The power transfer levels will			need to be upgraded by twenty			percent. The efficiency of your			warp coils is also unsatisfactory.					GEORDI			The coil efficiency is well within			specifications, Captain.	Jellico moves to the pool table and begins looking at	the monitors.					JELLICO			I'm not interested in the specs,			Geordi. The efficiency needs to			be at least fifteen percent			higher.					GEORDI				(shocked)			Fifteen percent? STAR TREK: "Chain of Command, Pt. I" - 10/06/92 - ACT TWO 17.17   CONTINUED:					DATA			That is an attainable goal. But			it will require realigning the			warp coil and taking the secondary			distribution grid off-line.					JELLICO			Very good, Data.				(to Geordi)			That's exactly what I want you to			do.					GEORDI			Taking that grid off-line will			shut down the astrophysics lab,			exobiology, geological research --					JELLICO			We're not on a research mission.			Get it done in two days.	Geordi is too shocked to say anything at the moment.	Data offers what he thinks is helpful advice.					DATA			I believe that is also an			attainable goal. If we utilize			the entire Engineering department,			there should be sufficient			manpower available to complete the			task.					GEORDI			Sure, if they work around the			clock for the next two days.					JELLICO			Then you better get to it, Geordi.			It looks like you have some work			ahead of you.					GEORDI				(tight)			Yes, sir.					JELLICO			Data.	Jellico EXITS, with Data in tow.

Troi looks down at a stack of	crayon drawings sitting on the desk. Jellico notices	her gaze.					JELLICO				(re: drawings)			The latest masterpieces from my			son.				(picks up one)			It's an elephant.				(turns drawing)			I think.					TROI				(looks)			Definitely an elephant.  STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt.

Most of			them have served under Captain			Picard for several years. They			knew him, knew what he expected.			Now they're being asked to adjust			to a new captain and a new way of			doing things. They're uncertain			how to react.					JELLICO			I see your point. This all could			be very unsettling to them...					TROI			And to you. Perhaps everyone just			needs some time... time for you to			get to know and trust the crew...			and time for them to understand			how you want things done.	Jellico nods thoughtfully and thinks for a few seconds.					JELLICO			I'm glad you brought this to my			attention, Deanna.				(beat)			Unfortunately, I don't have time			for a honeymoon with the crew.					(MORE) STAR TREK: "Chain of Command, Pt.

Captain Jellico			is making major changes in every			department on the ship.					GEORDI			I don't mind making changes and I			don't mind hard work. But he's			not giving me the time to do the			work. Someone's got to make him			listen to reason.					RIKER			He's not going to listen to me.			I think he's made that abundantly			clear.	Geordi stops him.					GEORDI			Then can I make a suggestion?			Talk to Captain Picard.

I" - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FIVE      51.70   CONTINUED:					JELLICO			Which planet?					RIKER			Celtris Three.	A beat as Jellico thinks.					JELLICO			Can you detect any theta-band			subspace emissions coming from			Celtris?	Riker works for a moment.					RIKER			There're some residual traces...			it looks like there were emissions			up until a few minutes ago.	A long moment as Jellico looks at the monitors. He	doesn't want to give anything away.					JELLICO			Open a secure channel to Admiral			Nechayev. Priority two. Put it			through to my Ready Room.					RIKER			Aye, sir.	Jellico EXITS to the Ready Room and Riker looks after	him with a puzzled expression.                                             CUT TO:70A  INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)	Jellico moves to his desk and activates the terminal.	After a moment, the Starfleet logo is replaced by the	image of Admiral Nechayev.					NECHAYEV			Captain?       STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. I" - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FIVE     51A.70A  CONTINUED:					JELLICO			Those emissions you were so			concerned about... have just			stopped.				(beat)			I'd say that one way or the other,			our friends have finished their			task.	There is a beat as Nechayev takes note of this.					NECHAYEV			Have you heard from our friends?					JELLICO			No.					NECHAYEV			Let me know if you do. I'd very			much like to see them again.					JELLICO			So would I, Admiral.	The transmission ENDS. Off Jellico's face as he	contemplates the fate of Picard and the others.                                             CUT TO:71   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM	The room is very large with a huge entry door.	(Footsteps tend to echo in here.) There are few	furnishings except for the center of the room where	there is a large DESK. Although not immediately	apparent, the desk has many hidden panels and drawers.	Next to the desk is the INTERVIEW CHAIR, an ominous	looking piece of furniture with the ability to manacle	the subject's wrists and ankles.	Picard is pushed into the room by a Cardassian. The	door SHUTS behind him. Picard looks around for a	moment... then a VOICE is heard coming out of the	darkness.       STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt. I" - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FIVE      52.71   CONTINUED:					MADRED'S VOICE				(o.c.)			A challenge.	GUL MADRED steps out of the shadows and moves toward	the table.					MADRED			You should prove to be an			interesting challenge. Possibly			the most interesting to come			through that door in many years.					PICARD			What do you want?					MADRED			Why... you, of course.				(beat)			Picard. Jean-Luc. Serial number			SP dash nine three seven dash two			one five. Son of Maurice and			Yvette Picard, born in La Barre,			France. Former Captain of the			Stargazer... where you conducted			extensive studies on theta-band			subspace carrier waves.	Picard is shocked at this level of knowledge and what	it implies.					MADRED			Don't look so surprised. How			could we have designed a lure for			the Captain of the Federation			flagship unless we knew something			about his background.	Picard recovers quickly and his features harden.					PICARD			All right... so you concocted an			elaborate ruse to bring me here.			Why?	Madred's expression hardens.					MADRED			In this room, you do not ask			questions. I ask them, and you			answer. And if I'm not satisfied			with those answers... you will			die.       STAR TREK: "Chain... , Pt.
