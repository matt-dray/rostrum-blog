	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship is on the outskirts of a DARK MATTER NEBULA.
	This material is not normally visible to the eye, so
	all we should see at this point is a large black space
	devoid of stars hanging in front of the ship. Perhaps
	some nearby stars around the periphery of the nebula
	are partly obscured by the gaseous material, thus
	indicating that something is blocking our view.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's Log: Stardate 44932.3
			The Enterprise is preparing to
			enter the Mar Oscura, an
			unexplored dark matter nebula
			first identified over a century
			ago.

2    INT. TORPEDO BAY

	This is the torpedo operations center. Launch bays for
	torpedos are set into one of the bulkheads. DATA is
	working on a photon torpedo which has been slid out of
	one of the launch bays.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Commander Data is modifying
			several of our photon torpedos
			for an experiment designed to
			elicit more information about this
			unusual phenomenon.

3    NEW ANGLE

	Revealing ENSIGN JENNA D'SORA as she moves over to
	assist Data. Jenna is of Mediterranean descent,
	petite, and almost fragile in appearance. But her
	doll-like face belies the fact that she is a veteran
	security officer who could probably hold her own
	against anyone aboard ship. Emotionally, as we will
	learn, she is more fragile.


       STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV 4/17/91 - TEASER       1A.

3    CONTINUED:

	On the surface this manifests itself only as an
	eagerness to please, a puppy-dog friendliness that asks
	for approval and affection.

          STAR TREK: "In Theory" - 3/20/91 - TEASER          2.

3    CONTINUED:

					DATA
			The initial dispersal pattern
			should not be more than seven
			kilometers in diameter.

					JENNA
				(makes adjustment)
			Six point eight kilometers...

	Jenna is just a tiny bit distracted, a little quiet...
	but it's enough for Data to pick up on.

					DATA
			That should suffice.
				(beat)
			Is there something occupying your
			thoughts, Jenna? You are somewhat
			subdued today...

					JENNA
			I bumped into Jeff in the
			turbolift again this morning.

					DATA
			Was the experience as emotionally
			problematic as last week's
			encounter?

	Beat... Jenna doesn't answer directly, but keeps going
	with her thought.

					JENNA
			He... asked me to dinner.

					DATA
			What was your response?

					JENNA
			I told him I'd think about it.

					DATA
			As you requested, I must now
			remind you of the reasons you
			decided to end your relationship
			with Jeff.

	Jenna's eyes roll slightly... and there's a bit of
	humor in her expression... a small bargain between
	friends.

         STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/8/91 - TEASER 3-3A.           

3    CONTINUED: (2)

					JENNA
			I guess I asked for this... go
			ahead.

					DATA
			You objected to the fact that Jeff
			seemed unwilling to set aside
			sufficient time for you. You said
			he never did... the little things.
			He was unresponsive. You disliked
			the sound he made when he ate his
			soup...

					JENNA
				(with humor)
			Okay, okay... I remember.

					DATA
			This is the third time I have
			refreshed your memory. Do you
			wish to rescind our agreement?

					JENNA
			No, no. It's for my own good.
			It's just so easy to forget.
				(indicates device)
			Hand me that sequencer.

					DATA
			Many lovers throughout history
			have had similar difficulties.
			Anne Boleyn was quite distressed
			that Henry the Eighth preferred
			the company of his huntsmen to
			that of his wife.

	Data hands her a small instrument. She waves it a few
	times over the inside of the torpedo, taking a reading.


        STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/8/91 - TEASER        4.

3    CONTINUED: (3)

					JENNA
				(wryly)
			As I recall, she ended up losing
			her head. I guess I'm well out of
			this.
				(beat)
			When did you develop an interest
			in romantic historical figures?

					DATA
			Six weeks ago, when you and Jeff
			dissolved your relationship, I
			saw an excellent opportunity to
			study that aspect of human
			intimacy. Also, I believed it
			was my obligation to do so.

					JENNA
			"Obligation"? What do you mean?

					DATA
			I anticipated this would be a
			difficult period for you. As your
			friend, it is my responsibility
			to be supportive in times of need.

					JENNA
				(genuinely touched)
			That is really sweet, Data.

	She looks at him with gratitude, affection... and
	something more...

        STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/1/91 - TEASER        5.

4    NEW ANGLE

	Data closes the panel on the torpedo. Jenna moves to
	a control console on the bulkhead. Data gives
	everything one final check and then steps away from
	the torpedo and nods to Jenna. She works the controls
	and the torpedo SLIDES INTO the launch bay.

					DATA
				(hits communicator)
			Data to Bridge. We are ready for
			the first illumination test.

5    INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	RIKER in Command, ENSIGN MCKNIGHT at Con, WORF at
	Tactical.

					RIKER
				(to com)
			Acknowledged. All science
			stations stand by... we're about
			to light up the nebula. Mister
			Worf?

					WORF
				(reading console)
			Launch bay one shows ready,
			Commander.

					RIKER
			Fire torpedo.

	Worf works the console.

6    INT. TORPEDO BAY (OPTICAL)

	Data and Jenna are reading displays and working
	consoles. A SOUND EFFECT is heard and some lights
	FLASH to indicate the torpedo launch. A display
	monitor gives an EXTERIOR VIEW of the nebula outside
	the ship.

          STAR TREK: "In Theory" - 3/20/91 - TEASER          6.

7    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The torpedo DISAPPEARS into the nebula. After a couple
	seconds, the torpedo EXPLODES and there is a BRILLIANT
	SHOW OF LIGHT. The dark matter has been illuminated
	by the display and the gaseous cloud can be seen
	clearly for the first time.

8    INT. TORPEDO BAY (OPTICAL)

	Data and Jenna watch the monitor.

					JENNA
				(softly)
			It's beautiful.
				(she moves closer to
				 him)
			Like watching fireworks when I
			was a little girl.

	Jenna turns her gaze to Data... and there is a great
	deal more in her look than simple friendship. We get
	another hint of her growing feelings for him. As they
	watch the brilliant light show together...

									FADE OUT.

                            ACT ONE                             

	FADE IN:

9    INT. TEN FORWARD

	A woodwind quintet composed of Data (oboe), Jenna
	(flute), KEIKO, (clarinet) and TWO N.D. MALE
	CREWMEMBERS (bassoon, French horn), is playing a piece
	of music to the patrons in the room, including O'BRIEN.

	The music comes to a stop and there is APPLAUSE from
	the audience. The members of the quartet stand and
	acknowledge the crowd. O'Brien moves toward the
	"stage" area along with a few other well-wishers.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Keiko)
			It was wonderful.

	He gives her a quick kiss.

					KEIKO
			Thanks.

	Data sets down his instrument, Jenna keeps her flute in
	hand, still stares at her music, obviously unhappy.
	Data cocks his head in puzzlement.

					DATA
			Is anything wrong?

					JENNA
			My tempo was off. I felt like
			I was really rushing it.

					DATA
			I do not believe that is so. Your
			rhythmic control has improved
			markedly. I heard no fluctuations
			during the performance.

	She relaxes a bit -- Data's support means a lot to her.

					JENNA
			Well, maybe. But I ruined the
			coda. I got confused with the
			phrasing... I kept breathing at
			the wrong times.

       STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT ONE       7A.

9    CONTINUED:

					DATA
			The contrapuntal nature of the
			composition is quite demanding.
			We will give the rhythmic
			patterns more attention in our
			next rehearsal.
				(beat)
			However, I am quite certain that
			the audience was oblivious to such
			nuances. They seemed to enjoy
			the performance thoroughly.

	She looks at him and smiles -- his kind attention makes
	her feel better.

					JENNA
			Thanks, Data... you're really
			sweet.

10   INT. TEN FORWARD - LATER

	A short time later. Data, Jenna, Keiko, and O'Brien
	are sitting at one of the tables, sharing drinks.

       STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 3/27/91 - ACT ONE       8.

10   CONTINUED:

					KEIKO
			... every night, Miles leaves his
			socks on the floor. When we got
			married, I made the mistake of
			picking them up a few times...
			then I realized if I kept it up
			I'd be doing it the rest of my
			life... so I stopped... figuring
			he'd get the message and do it
			himself.

	Miles smiles easily, unbothered.

					KEIKO
			One night goes by... two... a
			week... ten days... by now there's
			a pile of socks half a meter
			high!

					O'BRIEN
			Come on... it wasn't half a
			meter...

					KEIKO
			After two weeks I couldn't stand
			it any more -- I bundled them up
			and put them in the cleaning
			processor. And I'm still doing
			it.

					O'BRIEN
			And a very good job of it she
			does, too...

	He winks broadly at Data as Keiko whirls on him, rising
	to the jibe. O'Brien laughs and puts his arm around
	her. They kiss lightly on the lips, a loving couple
	accepting each other's faults and foibles. Jenna
	regards them, a look of faint envy crossing her face.
	She glances at Data, touches his arm occasionally, and
	as she talks, her manner suggests that they, too, are
	a couple...

        STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV 4/17/91 - ACT ONE 9-9A.           

10   CONTINUED: (2)

					JENNA
			Keiko, you sound just like Data.
			He came to my quarters the other
			day to give me a music lesson,
			and he said the funniest thing...
			how did you put it, Data?

					DATA
			I believe I observed that you seem
			to have an aversion to
			orderliness... but it was not
			intended as a humorous remark...

					JENNA
			So before we started, he gallantly
			offered to help me straighten up.

	She threads her arm fondly through his, clearly wanting
	to establish that they, too, have this easy-going
	relationship.

					DATA
			And a very good job of it I did,
			too.

	He gives O'Brien a broad wink and the group laughs.
	Data is pleased that he has caused this reaction --
	though he's not entirely certain why.

14   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship near the nebula.

15   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	Data is at the aft science station, studying
	information from the nebula.

					PICARD
			Report, Mister Data.

					DATA
			I am nearly finished compiling
			the readings from our most recent
			illuminatory burst. They differ
			considerably from surveys of
			similar nebulae.

					PICARD
			How so?

					DATA
			Dark matter density is nearly one
			order of magnitude higher than
			previously found.
				(beat)
			Lifeforms here may have developed
			in ways never before observed.

					RIKER
				(to Data)
			Interesting hypothesis. Are there
			any M-Class planets we could check
			out?

					DATA
			Several, Sir. The nearest is
			approximately three light years
			from our present position.

       STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV 4/17/91 - ACT ONE       11.

15   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			It's worth a look. We'll continue
			with our survey along the way.
				(to McKnight)
			Ensign, get the planet's
			coordinates from Commander Data
			and plot a course, three quarters
			impulse.

									CUT TO:

16   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship ENTERS the nebula at impulse.

16A  INT. SICKBAY (PREVIOUSLY SCENE 11)

	BEVERLY and a NURSE are standing at the large wall
	monitor, running a complex experiment.

					BEVERLY
				(to Nurse)
			Let's increase the flow rate --
			see if that helps.

	The Nurse nods and then leaves. Beverly looks at the
	monitor for a beat, then moves toward her office.

16B  ON BEVERLY (PREVIOUSLY SCENE 12)

	As she walks by a RACK OF INSTRUMENTS on the wall...
	Several steps past it she hears a glassy, metallic
	CLINK! She stops... looks back at the rack in
	puzzlement... then looks down at the floor.

16C  NEW ANGLE (PREVIOUSLY SCENE 13)

	Revealing a MEDICAL INSTRUMENT lying on the deck
	beneath the rack. She's puzzled.

	She looks around, but there's no one here at the
	moment. With a trace of annoyance, Beverly picks up
	the instrument and replaces it in the rack.

       STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV 4/17/91 - ACT ONE       12.

17   INT. TORPEDO BAY

	Data and Jenna are working on an open photon torpedo.
	Jenna is installing a small cannister inside the
	central chamber of the torpedo. Data monitors with
	a small digital instrument. The work doesn't require
	their constant attention.

					JENNA
			Sometimes in the summer we went
			on cookouts... just my little
			brother and me, and Mother... She
			was hopeless without a replicator.
			But we didn't care.

					DATA
			Children often do not develop a
			discerning palette until well
			beyond adolescence.

					JENNA
			It's wasn't that. It just felt...
			so good to be together... as a
			family. We didn't have much of
			that after my father died... so
			those times were really special.
				(beat)
			I wish we were back there now...
			you and I...

					DATA
			The unidirectional nature of the
			time continuum makes that an
			unlikely possibility.

					JENNA
				(laughs)
			That's one thing I've always loved
			about you. You make me laugh.
				(beat)
			You know, maybe I've been with
			the wrong men. Why couldn't they
			be like you, Data? You've got
			everything.

					DATA
			That is not true. I have no human
			feelings.

	She takes his hand in a friendly fashion.

       STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV 4/17/91 - ACT ONE       13.

17   CONTINUED:

					JENNA
			But you've still given me more
			than any of them. You've spent
			time with me when I was lonely...
			you've encouraged me when I was
			down. No one could have been
			kinder to me... those are the
			things that matter...

       STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT ONE       14.

17   CONTINUED: (3)

	Jenna smiles.

					JENNA
				(continuing, re: the
				 job)
			Well, I think that's it.
				(with put on formality)
			With your permission, Commander,
			I'll be going.

					DATA
				(straight)
			Permission granted.

	She gives him a friendly kiss on the cheek, but only
	pulls a short distance away afterwards.

					JENNA
			I don't know if you're aware of
			it... but you're very handsome...

	She kisses him again, this time longer and on the lips
	-- a real kiss, which Data doesn't resist. Jenna
	smiles.

					JENNA
				(continuing)
			See you tomorrow...

	She turns and leaves the room. OFF Data's reaction.

18   INT. TEN FORWARD

	It's after hours and the room is deserted. GUINAN is
	mixing several drinks in odd-shaped glasses on the bar.
	Data ENTERS, there is a lost, puzzled expression on
	his face.

					GUINAN
			Hi, Data. Want to try something
			new?

	Data sits at the bar and looks at the drinks she's
	making with only slight curiosity.

					GUINAN
				(continuing)
			This is a concoction I heard about
			on Prakal Two. I think it's
			great, but I want another opinion,
			so...

	She carefully combines a yellow and a blue liquid in
	a glass, producing a sickly green potion. She offers
	it to Data. He takes a small drink. She waits for
	a reaction.

					DATA
			Eighty-seven percent Saurian
			Brandy... Targ milk and Denevian
			mead comprise the rest... an
			unusually high concentration of
			mono-saccharides and fructose
			compounds.

					GUINAN
			Too sweet, huh?

	Data gives her a look -- "Kool Aid." Guinan drinks
	some of the potion herself and Data retreats into
	thoughtful silence.

       STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT TWO       16.

18   CONTINUED:

	Guinan quickly picks up on the fact that something's
	on his mind.

					GUINAN
			If I didn't know you better, I'd
			say you were... preoccupied.

					DATA
			Ensign D'Sora just gave me what
			could be considered a very...
			passionate kiss in the Torpedo
			Bay.

	Guinan gives him a long piercing look.

					GUINAN
			Really?
				(beat)
			How did it make you feel?

					DATA
			I cannot feel because---

					GUINAN
			I know, I know. You have no
			emotions.
				(very intrigued)
			What I mean is, what's going on
			in there?
				(points at his head)
			What did it make you think about?

					DATA
			I was... intrigued. Jenna seemed
			to be displaying genuine affection
			toward me.

       STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT TWO       17.

18   CONTINUED: (2)

					GUINAN
			And then?

					DATA
			I calculated that Jenna's actions
			to date would tend to support the
			supposition that she wishes to
			initiate a non-platonic mutually
			exclusive relationship.

					GUINAN
			You're just a starry-eyed
			romantic, aren't you?
				(before he can answer)
			What do you think of her?

					DATA
			I find her to be a competent
			officer... highly motivated...
			lacking somewhat in her
			understanding of the theory
			underlying dilithium matrix
			applications---

					GUINAN
			But what do you think of her
			personally?
				(beat)
			Do you like her?

					DATA
			I have become... used to her.

					GUINAN
			It sounds like the next step is
			up to you.
				(beat)
			So what are you gonna do about
			it?

					DATA

	steps inside, carrying an object in both her hands.

					JENNA
			I know it's a little unexpected...

			You are correct. I did not

	Data stays at the easel, continues to paint.

					JENNA
			I couldn't wait... I wanted you
			to have this.

	She holds the object out to Data -- it is a small
	alien sculpture, exotic and beautiful. He studies it,
	but does not take it.

					DATA
			You have often expressed
			dissatisfaction with the Spartan
			nature of my quarters. Is this
			an attempt at embellishment?

					JENNA
			The cat's out of the bag.

				(looking around)
			Spot?

					JENNA
			I mean you've caught me in the
			act. I'm just trying to brighten
			things up around here.
				(re: the sculpture)
			It's Tyrinean. What do you think?

	Data studies the object for a moment.

					DATA
			Its line is both fluid and formal,
			yet retains an unpremeditated
			quality. The tactility of the
			surface enrichment is evocative
			of the neo-primitive period in
			Tyrinean blade carving.

					JENNA
			I hadn't thought of it that way.

			Perhaps if I looked for a suitable

					JENNA
				(pleased)
			Much better.

	Data stands and walks with the carving to a remote
	corner of the room, placing it onto a bare surface.

					DATA
			The ambient light in this location
			accentuates its contours.

	Data observes Jenna's neutral response. Then thinks
	for a beat. He returns to a much more central table.

36   CONTINUED: (5)

					DATA
				(continuing)
			However, a gift should not
			necessarily be placed according
			to aesthetic criteria. A more
			central location will carry added
			meaning.

	He places the carving in the more noticeable location.
	Jenna steps over to him, takes his hand.

					JENNA
			Data, what's important is that
			you're trying. You don't know
			how much that means to me.

	She indicates the easel.

					JENNA
				(continuing)
			Now, go back to your painting.

	Data starts to go back to the easel... hesitates, looks
	at her.

			I'll see you tonight.

	FOLLOW Jenna as she goes out the door, smile on her

	briefcase, looking like a cross between Ward Cleaver
	and the Man in the Grey Flannel Suit. Jenna has just
	come in, is still in uniform, and looks a little
	frazzled.

					DATA
			Hi, honey, I am home.

					JENNA
			Hi.

	He kisses her on the check. She reacts a moment to
	his manner -- they aren't living together, and Data's
	home from work attitude is a bit odd. But she brushes
	it off.

					JENNA
			Any luck at your end?

					DATA
			Negative. We performed a full
			systems diagnostic and found no
			malfunctions.

					JENNA
			We did a full security sweep.
			Nothing.

	She flops down on the couch, takes off her shoes, and
	drops them on the floor. There are several other pairs
	there -- this is something she does every night.

					DATA
			Can I get you a drink, dear?

	Another little take... Data's saying the right things,
	but it comes off a bit strangely.

					JENNA
			Well, yes. I think I'll have...
			a Calaman Sherry.

					DATA
			Excellent choice. I shall join
			you.

	He moves to the replicator.

					DATA
			Two Calaman Sherries.
				(to Jenna)
			Would you like some dinner as
			well?

					JENNA
			I'm too tired to think about what
			I want... maybe later.

	The replictor produces the drinks; he carries them to
	her.

					DATA
			Whatever you like, dear.

	He gives her a drink and she starts too sip. But he
	stops her arm, indicates that they should toast. He
	lifts his glass.

47   CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA
			Darling, you remain as
			aesthetically pleasing as the day
			we first met. I believe I am the
			most fortunate sentient in this
			sector of the galaxy.

	He touches her glass with his, and then takes a drink.
	So does Jenna, though she eyes him a bit warily. This
	is feeling really strange...

					DATA
			Now... you must relax. Put your
			feet up. I will take care of
			everything.

	He rises and begins to straighten things in the
	perpetual clutter of Jenna's quarters. He picks up the
	shoes which have collected on the floor.

					DATA
			I could organize your closets.
			I have found that by grouping
			apparel first by function, and
			then by color from light to dark,
			one can more easily locate one's
			desired choice.

	He heads toward the bedroom with the shoes.

					JENNA
			Data... it's all right. You don't
			have to do that...

					DATA
			But I am happy to do it.

					JENNA
			Please... put them down.

	Acquiescent, Data puts the shoes down right where he is
	-- in the doorway. He swoops down on the couch beside
	her, utterly attentive.

					DATA
			What would you like, dear? Am
			I not paying enough attention to
			you?

					JENNA
			It's not that...

47   CONTINUED: (4)

					DATA
			Perhaps I have not given you
			enough compliments. Your hair
			is looking particularly silky
			tonight...

					JENNA
			Data... there's just something...
			strange... about the way you're
			acting...

	Data tries to figure that one out.

					DATA
			Am I not behaving as a solicitous
			mate?

					JENNA
			Well, yes, but...

					DATA
			Tending to your every need?

					JENNA
			What is wrong with you tonight?

	Data responds to her angry tone, matching it as best
	he can.

					DATA
			My most recent self-diagnostic
			revealed no malfunctions. Perhaps
			something is wrong with you.

	Jenna stares at him, unbelieving.

					JENNA
			I've never seen you behave so...
			foolishly. Why are you doing
			this?

					DATA
				(still "angry")
			You may not tell me how I should
			behave. You are not my mother.

					JENNA
			What?

					DATA
			"You are not my mother." Is that
			not an appropriate response to
			your statement that I am behaving
			foolishly?

					JENNA
				(completely frustrated)
			Data, I think you should just
			leave.

	Data cocks his head.

					DATA
				(calm)
			You do not wish to continue our...
			lovers quarrel?

	She stares at him, dumbfounded.

					JENNA
			Is that what this is?

47   CONTINUED: (6)

					DATA
			In my study of interpersonal
			dynamics, I learned that conflict
			followed by emotional release
			often strengthens a connection
			between two people.

					JENNA
			But there's just something
			forced and artificial about the
			way you're doing it. It's not
			the real you.

					DATA
			With respect to romantic
			relationships, there is no... real
			me. I am drawing upon various
			literary and cultural sources to
			help define my role.

	Jenna takes a moment to absorb all this... the whole
	thing has been an act, a part of his "program"... the
	solicitousness, the helpfulness, the argument --
	everything. After a beat she goes to him.

          STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 3/28/91 - ACT FOUR          46.

47   CONTINUED: (6)

			Kiss me.

	He stands and obliges her. After a beat...

					JENNA
			What were you just thinking?

					DATA
			At that particular moment, I was
			reconfiguring the warp field
			parameters, analyzing the
			collected works of Charles
			Dickens, calculating the maximum
			pressure I could safely apply to
			your lips, considering a new food
			supplement for Spot...

	His voice trails off as he notices the crestfallen look
	on her face. Jenna tries to hide her disappointment...
	even from herself.

					JENNA
				(half-hearted smile)
			I'm glad I was in there somewhere.

	She hugs him... but we can see the uneasiness growing
	on her face.

					DATA
			During the series of events, I

	Data indicates the Okudagram, which shows "lines" of
	normal space interrupted by pockets or deformations
	of varying sizes and shapes. A graphic depiction of
	the Enterprise is in the midst of it all.

					DATA
			The unusual preponderance of dark
			matter in this nebula is causing

	He points from one "pocket" to another.

					DATA
			As the Enterprise moves through

			Yes, sir, but they can only be

	Riker moves to the monitor, points to the Enterprise

	BY THE WINDOW). Picard can't even move from the g
	force.

					PICARD
				(to Com)
			Now would be a good time, Mister
			O'Brien...

87   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Riker and the others react to a tiny explosion far out
	in front of the ship -- it's the shuttle.

					RIKER
			O'Brien -- did we get him?

87A  INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)

	As Picard MATERIALIZES, heads for the door.

					O'BRIEN
			Aye, sir, we got him.

					PICARD
			I'm a little dizzy, Number One...
			but none the worse... on my way...

87B  INT. BRIDGE

					RIKER
				(relieved)
			Acknowledged, sir.

           STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT FIVE          60.

87B  CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Commander, we are nearing the
			perimeter -- one million
			kilometers away.

					RIKER
			All right, let's make a run for
			it.

	A tense moment -- will there be more potholes?

88   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	As the great ship plows toward the edge of the
	nebula... and then shoots out into normal space.

89   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	as Picard emerges from the turbolift.

					RIKER
			We're clear of the nebula, sir.

	Picard looks out at the starfield... relieved to see
	normal space again. He moves toward his chair.

					PICARD
			Ensign, plot a course for Starbase
			Two-Sixty. Warp two. Engage.

90   OMITTED

91   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship at warp in normal space.

           STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT FIVE         60A.

92   INT. DATA'S QUARTERS

	Data is preparing two place settings for an intimate
	dinner. His cat passes by. The door CHIMES.

          STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 3/27/91 - ACT FIVE          61.

92   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Enter.

	The door opens and Jenna ENTERS the room, crosses
	toward Data.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Hello.

	Jenna gives him a peck on the cheek. Her smile is a
	little weak.

					JENNA
			Hi.

	She notices several potted plants and a couple of
	antique Japanese style hanging lanterns.

					JENNA
				(continuing)
			The place looks great.

					DATA
			Thank you. It is much less
			Spartan, is it not?

					JENNA
			Much less... It looks... great...
			it really does... it looks great.

					DATA
			Jenna, you are repeating yourself.
			I have found this to be indicative
			of mental distraction. Is that
			a correct assumption in this
			instance?

					JENNA
			I'm afraid it is.

	Data moves toward the replicator.

					DATA
			Then perhaps we should begin our
			meal. Among humans, a low serum
			glucose level is often responsible
			for --

					JENNA
				(interrupting)
			-- Data.

           STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT FIVE          62.

92   CONTINUED: (2)

	Data pauses.

					JENNA
				(continuing)
			Let's talk... first.

	She indicates his chair at the table. Data comes back,
	sits down. She sits opposite him.

					JENNA
				(continuing)
			I'm not sure how to begin.

					DATA
			What is the subject?

					JENNA
			You and me. Our relationship.

					DATA
			Yes?

					JENNA
				(deep breath)
			Data, sometimes people blindly
			make the same mistake again and
			again. Until it finally happens
			in a way so obvious and so
			blatant, that they can no longer
			deny what they've been doing.

					DATA
			Are you currently experiencing
			this phenomenon?

					JENNA
			I didn't see it until today. I
			got out of a relationship with
			an unemotional man. And went
			right back into another with a
			man who is absolutely incapable
			of emotion.

					DATA
			There does appear to be a
			recurring motif.

					JENNA
			You were so kind and attentive.
			I thought maybe that would be
			enough.

          STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 3/27/91 - ACT FIVE          63.

92   CONTINUED: (3)

					DATA
			It is not?

					JENNA
			No, it's not. Because as close
			as we are, I don't really matter
			to you. Not really. Nothing I
			could do or say will ever make
			you happy, or hurt you, or touch
			you in any way.

					DATA
			That is... a valid projection.

	Data thinks for a moment.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			It is apparent that my reach has
			exceeded my grasp in this
			particular area. I am perhaps
			not nearly so human as I aspire
			to become...

	A beat.

					DATA
				(continuing, pleasantly)
			If you are ready to eat, I will
			bring our meal.

	Data stands. Jenna looks at him sadly for a beat --
	this is just what she was talking about.

					JENNA
			No. That's alright.

	She stands.

					JENNA
				(continuing)
			I'd better go, Data.

					DATA
			If you wish.

	Jenna reaches over and kisses him on the cheek. Starts
	to turn toward the door.

           STAR TREK: "In Theory" - REV. 4/2/91 - ACT FIVE          64.

92   CONTINUED: (4)

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Jenna. Are we no longer... a
			couple?

	Her eyes suddenly fill with tears.

					JENNA
			No... we're not.

					DATA
			Then I will delete the
			appropriate program.

					JENNA
				(quickly toward the
				 door)
			I'll see you later...

	She goes out the door -- it closes behind her. Data
	watches for a moment. The cat suddenly jumps up on his
	lap.

					DATA
			Hello, Spot.

	He reaches down to pet it, and the animal nuzzles up to
	his hand.

	OFF Data's face...

									FADE OUT.
