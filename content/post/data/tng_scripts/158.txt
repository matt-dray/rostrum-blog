But we have no			great cause to desire the approach			of the day.					WILLIAMS			Who goes there?	King Henry ENTERS... his back to us... so we cannot	see who is playing him...					DATA (KING HENRY)			A friend.					WILLIAMS			Under what captain serve you?					DATA (KING HENRY)			Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.					WILLIAMS			I pray you, what thinks he of			our estate?	Reveal DATA...					DATA (KING HENRY)			Even as men wrecked upon a sand,			that look to be washed off the			next tide.					BATES			He hath not told his thought to			the king?     STAR TREK: "The Defector" - REV. 10/20/89 - TEASER     2.1    CONTINUED:					DATA (KING HENRY)			No, nor it is not meet he should.			For though I speak it to you, I			think the king is but a man, as			I am. The violet smells to him			as it doth to me, in his			nakedness he appears but a man.			Therefore, his fears, out of			doubt, be of the same relish as			ours are. Yet, no man should			possess him with any appearance			of fear, lest he, by showing it,			should dishearten his army.2    ANGLE PICARD (OPTICAL)	observing... delighted...					BATES			He may show what outward courage			he will, but I believe, as cold			a night as 'tis, he could wish			himself in Thames up to the neck.					DATA (KING HENRY)			Methinks I could not die anywhere			so contented as in the king's			company, his cause being just and			his quarrel honorable.					WILLIAMS			That's more than we know.					BATES			Aye, or more than we should seek			after. If his cause be wrong,			our obedience to the king wipes			the crime of it out of us.     STAR TREK: "The Defector" - REV. 10/20/89 - TEASER     2A.2    CONTINUED:					WILLIAMS			But if the cause be not good, the			king himself hath a heavy			reckoning to make when all those			legs and arms and heads chopped			off in a battle shall join			together at the latter day and			cry all "We died at such a place"			-- some swearing, some crying for			a surgeon, some upon their wives			left poor behind them. I am			afeared there are few die well			that die in a battle.					DATA (KING HENRY)			The king is not bound to answer			the particular endings of his			soldiers, the father of his son,			nor the master of his servant.					PICARD			Delightful... you're getting			better and better, Data...	Stepping out of character...					DATA			Freeze program.	The characters freeze.					DATA				(continuing)			Thank you, sir.

OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)	A guard stands behind Setal as he tells his story to	Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Geordi. The Romulan is	nearing the end of his account. He speaks with great	fervency. A man demanding to be heard. Picard listens	with a decidedly even expression.					SETAL			The humiliating defeat at the			Battle of Cheron has not been			forgotten.

Setal looks at him,	frustrated, that's not what he wanted to hear. Picard	looks back evenly. After a beat, Setal leaves. The	tension level drops considerably as the officers lean	back in their chairs, glance at each other.    STAR TREK: "The Defector" - REV. 10/19/89 - ACT TWO    13.21   CONTINUED: (3)					RIKER			He tells a hell of a story.					PICARD			You don't believe it...					RIKER			The empire knows we'd never allow			them to maintain a base within			the Neutral Zone.					DATA			Commander, it would not be an			atypical Romulan ploy. In their			long history of war, the Romulans			have rarely attacked first... they			prefer to test their enemy's			resolve.					RIKER			And how many times in their			history has there been a Romulan			defector?					DATA				(beat, checking his				 files)			Never, sir.					RIKER				(point made)			Because loyalty is fundamental			to their culture.					GEORDI				(unconvinced)			You really think he's a spy,			Commander?					RIKER				(nods)			I think he's been planted to draw			us into the Neutral Zone... we'd			look like the aggressors...					PICARD			... and the Romulans would have			a legitimate excuse to respond			with force.					RIKER			Exactly.    STAR TREK: "The Defector" - REV. 10/19/89 - ACT TWO    14.21   CONTINUED: (4)					DATA			That would also not be an atypical			Romulan ploy, sir.					PICARD				(thoughtful)			It is always a chess game with			them, isn't it?	Geordi looks out the viewport at the craft.					GEORDI			Well at least he's given us the			chance to get a look at some			Romulan technology.					PICARD				(acknowledges)			Mister La Forge, you will head			the away team over to the scout.				(to Riker)			Commander, you and Counselor Troi			will conduct Setal's			interrogation.					DATA			Permission to observe the			interrogation, sir...					PICARD			No, I need you with me on the			bridge, Data... there's much to			be done.				(beat)			We have less than forty-eight			hours to prevent a war... or			perhaps start one.
