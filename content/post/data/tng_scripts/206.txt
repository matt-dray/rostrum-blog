RIKER'S ROOM - RISA - NIGHT	A plush bedroom suite, with a picturesque view of	Risa through a large, open window. There are several	platters of exotic-looking hors d'oeuvres around the	room... not to mention an empty bottle of fine	champagne.	RIKER is standing near a long screen/partition,	dressed in casual clothes (perhaps a robe), looking	flushed with excitement. He calls out in a playful	tone of voice.					RIKER			Etana...	No response. He takes a step toward the screen.					RIKER				(continuing)			I know you're back there...			don't make me come after you.	A rustling NOISE from behind the screen. Then a	shadow, barely visible at a far end of the screen.	Riker edges toward the far end... quiet as a cat...	and lunges for it, simultaneously pulling back the	screen --	A clothing rack heaped with robes falls onto Riker,	draping him with fabric. A WOMAN grabs Riker from	behind and gives him a playful squeeze -- then dangles	a Starfleet communicator in front of his face. Before	Riker can grab her, she bolts across the room, romping	gleefully.					RIKER				(re: communicator)			Give me that...          STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/23/91 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:	He goes after her. The woman is alien, gorgeous, with	a full, flowing mane of hair. This is ETANA JOL.					ETANA			You don't need this.	Riker edges toward her... backing her toward a wall.	The dynamic between them is playful, teasing, charged	with erotic tension.					RIKER			Yes... I... do...	They match each other's movement, a game of cat and	mouse. Etana holds the communicator up to her mouth,	pretends to speak into it.					ETANA				(mocks Riker's voice)			Commander Riker to the			Enterprise. I've got a problem			down here on Risa!	She laughs. Riker lunges for her. She dodges, but	Riker's too quick. He pins her against the wall next	to the window -- presses close against her. Etana	grips the communicator in her hand and raises her arm,	keeping it out of reach.					RIKER			Give it to me.					ETANA			Go get it.	She tosses the communicator out the window. It falls	into the darkness.					RIKER			I can't believe you did that.					ETANA			Believe it.	She throws herself forward, catching Riker off	balance, sending both of them sprawling to the floor.	They flop onto a mound of oversized pillows -- Riker	on his back, Etana on top of him. They roll to the	side, engaged in a kiss. Then Etana breaks away and	looks into Riker's eyes...	She sits up and begins to massage Riker's shoulders.	The exuberant pace of their play slows down a little.	Riker enjoys the shoulder rub. He sighs.        STAR TREK: "The Game" - REV. 8/27/91 - TEASER        3.2    CONTINUED: (2)	Etana continues... leans down and kisses him on the	forehead. Riker smiles. She moves her focus to	Riker's temples, gently rubbing...	... and pulls something out of her robe -- a small	crescent-shaped DEVICE that resembles a skimmed-down	headset. Gradually, as a natural extension of the	massage, she slips the device around Riker's ear.					RIKER				(re: device)			What's this?					ETANA			It's a game. Everyone here's			playing it.	Riker smiles, likes the idea. Etana hooks the game	around his ear to hold it in place -- while a thin	mechanical "arm" extends in front of his eyes.					RIKER			Do I keep my eyes open, or			closed?					ETANA			Open.	Riker waits as Etana activates the game -- tiny lights	on its exterior come alive.3    CLOSE ON RIKER'S FACE (OPTICAL)	Two micro-thin LASERS emit from the arm extension and	scan Riker's face, the lights gliding across his	features. Quickly the lasers zero in on his eyes --	specifically, his pupils -- then vanish. This	establishes a connection between Riker and the game.4    RESUME	Riker reacts to something only he can see.					RIKER			What am I seeing?					ETANA			The playing field.	Riker is captivated.        STAR TREK: "The Game" - REV. 9/4/91 - TEASER        4.5    RIKER'S POV - THE GAME (OPTICAL)	We see Riker's view of his surroundings (the room,	Etana), with a semi-translucent GAME OVERLAY	superimposed on the scene. The overlay is an optical	grid pattern, with a cone and a disc across it.					RIKER			Now what?					ETANA			See the disc and the cone?					RIKER			Yeah...					ETANA			Concentrate... Make the disc go			into the cone...	Riker concentrates. His mental effort causes the disc	to skitter about, but it misses the cone. The game is	simple but exciting.	Riker laughs, enchanted with the game.					RIKER			How do I do this?					ETANA			Relax... just let go. You'll do			it.	Etana continues to rub his shoulders. He concentrates --	sending out more bursts -- but they keep missing the	cone. Finally, the disc drops right into the cone.					RIKER			Got it.	Suddenly, Riker's entire body tenses up. A moment,	then he relaxes and lets out a small gasp. Like he's	experienced a brief moment of internal pleasure.					RIKER				(re: sensation)			What was that?					ETANA			Your reward. For clearing the			first level.	Riker is amazed... and delighted.          STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/23/91 - TEASER          5.5    CONTINUED:					RIKER			How far does this game go?					ETANA			As far as you can take it. You			want to try for level two?	Riker grins -- "You bet." Four dots appear on the	playing field. Riker focuses his attention on the	game -- sending out the bursts. This time he wins	quickly -- all four dots are eliminated with just a	few bursts. As Riker lets out a gasp of even greater	pleasure...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE          6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            6    EXT.

And we are			on our way to an uncharted area			called the Phoenix Cluster.7    INT. BRIDGE	PICARD, DATA, WORF, and SUPERNUMERARIES at positions.	VARIOUS CREWMEMBERS are working at the science	stations. The bridge is alive with activity.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			We are all anticipating this			historic first look at the			region.	Riker ENTERS from the turbolift, looking fit and rested.	He heads for the command area, where Picard is working	his armrest controls. Riker sits down at his chair,	eager to resume his duties.					RIKER				(to Picard)			Things are getting busy around			here. Five more science teams			just beamed in from the Zhukov.			Quarters are filling up fast.					PICARD				(nods; concerned)			And on top of everything, there's			been a change. We now have only			two weeks to complete the			exploration.         STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE         6A.7    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Two weeks... that's not enough			time to explore a region that			size. I thought we had five			weeks.					DATA				(to Riker)			Starfleet has added a diplomatic			mission to Oceanus Four.          STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE          7.7    CONTINUED: (2)	Riker activates the information viewer next to his	chair and scans the mission orders.					PICARD			Will, I'm leaving it up to you to			make sure all science departments			have an equal chance to complete			their research.					RIKER			It'll be quite a juggling act.	Picard tries to lighten the tone.					PICARD			A bit of good news, as well.			We're to rendezvous with a			shuttlecraft carrying Wesley			Crusher. He's on vacation from			the Academy.	Riker reacts, pleasantly surprised.					RIKER			Wesley... good. We'll need an			extra hand around here.	Picard smiles -- it's clear they're both looking	forward to seeing Wesley again.8    INT. ENGINEERING	It's a busy day. GEORDI and various ENGINEERING NDS	are hard at work... including a striking young woman	named ROBIN LEFLER, who's at an opened panel,	organizing a pile of isolinear chips.	Riker ENTERS and approaches Geordi.					RIKER			Geordi... how are you coming with			the survey preparations?          STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE          8.8    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			I'm up to my neck in observation			schedules right now.	Geordi takes Riker to a console, shows him a rundown	of information.					GEORDI				(continuing)			Our biggest hurdle is sensor			availability.					RIKER			Especially since two new			exobiologists and three stellar			cartographers joined us from the			Zhukov.					GEORDI			Fifteen science teams, only two			weeks, and one long-range array			don't make a great combination.					RIKER			What about the lateral sensors?					GEORDI			They're booked solid for			planetary observation.					RIKER			And the gamma ray scanner?					GEORDI			We're reprogramming it now...				(to Robin)			Lefler... will you join us,			please?	Robin sets down her work and joins the two men.					GEORDI			You know Robin Lefler.					RIKER			Of course.					GEORDI			Her performance around here has			been sensational. I've decided			to make her a mission specialist.         STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE         8A.8    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER				(to Robin)			Congratulations.					ROBIN			Thank you, sir.          STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE          9.8    CONTINUED: (3)					RIKER			Okay, specialist -- what's our			sensor status?	Robin takes a deep breath -- this is her first time	reporting to high-level officers -- but she's	confident.					ROBIN			We're increasing the available			bandwidth... so more science			teams can use the sensors at			once. We figured out a way to do			it by multiplexing the array.					RIKER			Will it be ready by the time we			arrive?					ROBIN			Yessir. You can count on it.	Riker looks pleased.					RIKER			Keep it up, Lefler.	Robin smiles, nods, returns to her work. Geordi moves	to another console. Riker follows him...					RIKER			Geordi... I brought something			back from Risa. You've got to			try it.					GEORDI			I'd love to. But I'm running a			full sensor recalibration in ten			minutes. Can it wait?					RIKER			Sure. I'll catch up with you			later.	Geordi's already reabsorbed in his work. A beat, then	Riker EXITS...9    INT.

Chocolate chips. You're			not depressed, are you?	Troi reacts, a little embarrassed about being caught	with the large dessert.					TROI			I'm fine, Commander.					RIKER				(re: sundae)			Did you want to be alone with			that?					TROI			No. You can join us.	Riker sits down. Troi offers him the spoonful. He	declines.					RIKER			I don't like fudge.					TROI			Really. I never met a chocolate			I didn't like.	Troi takes the bite... and her expression turns	serious, like she's analyzing something in her mind.					RIKER			Doesn't it taste good?					TROI			Of course it does. But it's not			just a matter of taste. It's the			whole experience.	Riker is curious. Troi demonstrates, an expert on the	subject.					TROI			First you spoon the fudge from			around the rim... leaving only			ice cream in the middle...				(eats a bite)			Then gently spoon the ice cream			around the sides, like you're			sculpting it...					(MORE)         STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/30/91 - ACT ONE         11.9    CONTINUED: (3)					TROI (cont'd)				(another bite)			Relish every bite. Make every			one an event. And on the last			bite, close your eyes...	She closes her eyes and eats a spoonful.					RIKER			I never knew it was a ritual.					TROI			Chocolate is a serious thing.	Riker leans close to her, speaks in an intimate tone	of voice.					RIKER			You know... I brought something			back from Risa. It's better than			chocolate.					TROI			Oh... what is it?	A beat. Riker's response is almost a tease.					RIKER			Just a game.	OFF Troi's intrigued expression...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                          (NOTE: This page is being distributed for those who did not	get the complete page in the Final Draft script, For	those who did, there are no changes on this page.)         STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/23/91 - ACT TWO         12.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:10   INT.

Wesley's strength is sapping...					WESLEY			No...	The disc moves faster, closer to hitting the cone.	Then finally, the disc drops right into the cone.	Wesley's body tenses up. Then he relaxes, letting out	a small gasp of pleasure. He slumps a little,	succumbing to the game. It looks hopeless.					BEVERLY			That's it, Wesley... just let			yourself go...	Suddenly, the bridge lights GO OUT. Darkness.	Confusion.68   NEW ANGLE	on the turbolift doors opening. A tall FIGURE steps out	of the brightly-lit interior -- a dramatic silhouette	against the light. As the doors close, the figure	raises up an arm, aiming a device toward the room,	causing --	A series of BRIGHT WHITE FLASHES OF LIGHT. The effect	is blinding and erratic, like a flashbulb going off in	the darkness. With each flash of light, we see faces,	reactions:	-- FLASH! Picard and Beverly react, wide-eyed and	stunned, the light blinding them.	-- FLASH! FLASH! Worf and Riker fall back, hands in	front of their eyes, the light causing them pain.	-- FLASH! Troi and Geordi stumble back, dazzled by	the light.	A beat of darkness, then...					DATA (o.s.)			Computer, resume normal			illumination.             STAR TREK: "The Game" - 8/23/91 - ACT FIVE            53A.69   ANGLE - DATA	As the bridge lights come BACK ON. Data is standing	in the turbolift doorway, holding a palm beacon that's	been modified to send out flashes of light.           STAR TREK: "The Game" - REV. 9/4/91 - ACT FIVE           54.69   CONTINUED:	He has the beacon trained and ready to fire again, if	necessary. But the bridge crew looks dazed, like	they're coming out of a deep sleep.
