JOVIS CARGO BAY	The Enterprise shuttlepod has docked and DATA emerges	from the pilot seat.					PICARD (V.O.)			Because pure hytritium is too			unstable for our transporters,			Lieutenant Commander Data has been			shuttling the material to the			Enterprise.	VARRIA, a female humanoid, supervises THREE TECHNICIANS	who are moving a shipping case. The care and precision	with which they handle the case underlines the danger	involved.	Data opens the cargo door of the shuttlepod. The	technicians proceed to load the case onto the pod --	again with utmost care.					DATA				(touching his				 communicator)			Data to Enterprise.					PICARD (V.O.)			Go ahead, Mister Data.     STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/25/90 - TEASER     2.2    CONTINUED:					DATA			This will be the last trip... the			remaining cases of hytritium are			now being loaded.3    INT.

Mister Worf,			advise Beta Agni Two that our			departure is imminent.					WORF			Aye, Captain.					RIKER				(to Picard)			At warp six, we should be there			in just over sixteen hours.	Picard acknowledges.4    OMITTED4A   INT. JOVIS CARGO BAY	The Technicians have completed loading the shuttlepod	and closed the hatch. Through the window, we can see a	containment field (F/X -- nitrogen) promptly fill the	trunk. Data heads for the pilot seat.					DATA				(to comm)			Loading is complete. I am			proceeding with departure.				(protocol)			Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare			for docking, level one			precautions for incoming material			remain in effect.5    ANGLE ON DATA (OPTICAL)	Varria approaches Data and hands him a padd.     STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/25/90 - TEASER     3.5    CONTINUED:					VARRIA			If you'll just acknowledge this			last load, Commander...	Data takes the Padd and presses his thumb on an ID	panel... and BLUE SPARKS spring from the padd and dance	over Data.

MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Wesley; moments later.	The debris from the destroyed shuttle is still visible	on the viewscreen.					RIKER			Why didn't the containment field			hold?					GEORDI				(checking readings)			Unknown, Commander.					PICARD				(to Worf)			Hail the Jovis -- I want to speak			with Kivas Fajo.	Geordi and Worf work their consoles.					WORF			Sir, Mister Fajo is hailing us.					PICARD			On screen.12   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	as the image of KIVAS FAJO fills the screen. Fajo is a	male Zibalian with a commanding presence; a man of the	world -- or rather the galaxy -- with undeniable	personal charm and grace and yet someone not to be	trifled with.					FAJO			Captain Picard -- what happened?					PICARD			It is unclear at this time; we're			running a full analysis.					FAJO			We detected no malfunctions before			the explosion. Everything seemed			to be proceeding as smoothly as			the other flights. Were you able			to save the pilot?     STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/25/90 - ACT ONE     6.12   CONTINUED:					PICARD			No.	Fajo looks as if he lost his best friend.					FAJO			I'm sorry.	Picard nods his thanks but, having a mission, cannot	dwell on the moment.					PICARD			Mister Fajo, I would like to			analyze your sensor readings of			the explosion.					FAJO			Compared to the Enterprise's, our			sensors are rather primitive --			I doubt they contain any			information yours have overlooked.					PICARD			Perhaps, but I want to leave no			avenue unexplored.					FAJO			I understand. We'll transmit the			information.	Fajo nods to someone off screen.					WORF			Link established... Receiving.					FAJO			Can we be of any further			assistance?					PICARD				(to Riker)			How much hytritium did we manage			to bring on board?					RIKER			Eighty-one kilos.					GEORDI			That might be barely enough to			complete our mission, Captain...			but it's not leaving us any margin			for error.     STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/25/90 - ACT ONE     7.12   CONTINUED: (2)	Picard considers this, then:					PICARD				(to Fajo)			I realize we have acquired your			complete supply of hytritium.			Do you know where we could obtain			more?					FAJO			That may be difficult. The only			source I know is in the Sigma			Erani System.					RIKER				(to Picard)			Three weeks away.					FAJO			And I can't guarantee they'll have			any -- for obvious reasons, no			one wants to keep it around. In			fact, even I may stop selling			it -- it's just too dangerous.					RIKER			I guess we're fortunate you had			any at all, sir.					WORF				(to Picard)			Transfer of information is			complete, Captain.					PICARD			Mister Fajo, thank you for your			help.	Fajo nods as his image disappears, replaced by the	Jovis and starfield and wreckage of the shuttlecraft.13   NEW ANGLE	as Picard considers his options.					PICARD			Mister Crusher, lay in a course			for Beta Agni Two, warp six.					WESLEY			Aye, sir.     STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/26/90 - ACT ONE     8.13   CONTINUED:					RIKER				(to Picard)			The Grissom is currently near			the Sigma Erani system... I'll			have them stand by in case we need			more hytritium.					PICARD			Very good, Number One.					WESLEY			Course laid in, sir.	A beat as Picard looks out to his lost comrade.					PICARD			Engage.14   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	As the Enterprise BLASTS into warp, we hold on the	Jovis.15   INT. FAJO'S DEN	Data is "unconscious" on the floor. With a jolt, he	snaps back to functional status, sits up, runs a quick	re-calibration.					DATA				(ad lib)			Gibberish...				(self-adjusting)			...Starfleet... gibberish...			Enterprise.	That accomplished, he attempts to contact the	Enterprise -- but his insignia's missing.	Data gets to his feet, examines his environment. He's	in a windowless room filled with rare and beautiful	objects: paintings, sculpture, books, alien artifacts	and devices, perhaps even an exotic animal in a cage.	In the middle of the room is a large sofa -- a	comfortable place to sit and appreciate these	treasures.    STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/26/90 - ACT ONE    8A.16   ON DATA	as he studies the collection. Right in its center --	the focal point of the room -- is a piece of simple,	unobtrusive framework in the rough shape of a chair.	Functional rather than comfortable, it's what you'd set	up if you had a seated statue you wanted to display.	But there's no statue there.	Data turns at the SOUND of a door opening --     STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/27/90 - ACT ONE     9.17   NEW ANGLE	as the massive, vault-like door opens and Fajo and	Varria ENTER. The door immediately shuts and locks	behind them. Varria stays in the b.g. as Fajo crosses	to Data, looks him over with great interest and	delight. (Note: Fajo and Varria are wearing a small	device on their belts... and they never get closer	to Data than one meter.)					FAJO			Wondrous. The detail... the			balance. A remarkable piece of			work.					DATA			Why have I been brought here?					FAJO				(ignores the question)			The voice simulation is perfect.			Inflections, timing...	Fajo shakes his head in admiration, speaks "to" Data	for the first time:					FAJO (cont'd)			It took a lot of effort to get			you here... but I was sure it			would be worth it. I was right.					DATA				(patiently tries again)			I have been delivered here against			my wishes. I would like to know			the reason.					FAJO			Certainly. You're here for my			enjoyment and appreciation.					DATA			Am I to infer that you intend to			keep me captive?					FAJO			Captive? A most inappropriate			description, my good android.			May I call you Data?					DATA			It is my name.    STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/25/90 - ACT ONE    10.17   CONTINUED:					FAJO			I know.				(beat, confident)			Data, you will be catered to,			fawned over... you will be cared			for as never before... every wish			will be fulfilled...					DATA			I wish to leave.					FAJO			Almost every wish.	Data's puzzled.					DATA			This is unacceptable. I have no			desire to remain here... and even			if I did, my Starfleet duties			would not permit it.	Fajo grins at Varria, like an amused parent whose child	has said something precious.					FAJO			Single-minded, isn't it?					VARRIA				(nods)			Very persistent...					FAJO			But polite. A nice touch.				(to Data)			I decline to allow you to leave.					DATA			Then I am forced to attempt			escape.	Fajo indicates the door -- "go ahead." Data crosses to	the door, inspects it. It's solid. Data braces	himself against the frame, gives the door a shove.	It doesn't budge.					FAJO			Ten androids like you might be			able to force it open.				(shrugs)			But there aren't any other			androids like you, are there?    STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/26/90 - ACT ONE    11.17   CONTINUED: (2)	Data keeps inspecting the door, looking for access.	There's no visible keypad or opening device.					FAJO (cont'd)			It's keyed to the touch... reads			galvanic skin response, DNA			patterns, and two or three other			things. Trust me... you can't			open it.					DATA			Then you will have to open it for			me.18   ON FAJO (OPTICAL)	Fajo doesn't move a muscle as Data advances toward him.	The instant Data comes within two meters of Fajo, a	GLOWING AURA appears around Fajo's body... Data	stiffens, nearly loses control of his movements. It's	all Data can do to stagger back from Fajo.	Once Data's backed off, the AURA DISAPPEARS, and Data	slowly recovers. Fajo smiles at him.	Data starts to turn away -- then with all his android	speed makes a leap-and-grab for Fajo. No good -- the	AURA appears again, knocking Data backwards. As he	does, the AURA DISAPPEARS. It takes several beats	for Data to recuperate.					FAJO			I wouldn't try that again.				(indicates belt device)			It's a proximity-actuated field			that impedes positron flow. Not			good for your brainpaths in the			long term.19   ON DATA	trying another tack with Fajo.					DATA			I fail to understand the value			you place upon my presence.    STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/26/90 - ACT ONE    12.19   CONTINUED:					FAJO			Do you? Look around. This room			contains items gathered from half			the galaxy.	And he handles them with great fastidiousness...	carefully arranging a display when he replaces it.					FAJO			The very first Basotile ever			created by the Rodulans...			centuries old. Priceless. A vase			carved by the late Mark Off-Zel			on Sirrie Four. The only known			Roger Maris trading card from			Earth circa 1962... smell it...	Data does, reacts...					FAJO (cont'd)			Bubblegum... I've preserved the			scent...				(the animal)			A Lapling...					DATA				(reacts)			But I thought they were extinct...					FAJO			Yes, that is the general belief.			She's the last surviving member			of her species... defenseless			little creature, pity.				(beat)			Everything you see -- the only			one of its kind. Unique. An			original. Just as you are.				(at the chair)			Here, this is for you... your			place of honor... sit... if it			is not comfortable... but of			course, you have no thought of			comfort, do you...	Data does not sit and Fajo does not press the point	for now.    STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/25/90 - ACT ONE    13.19   CONTINUED: (2)					FAJO				(to Varria)			When Palor Toff learns of this,			he will swallow his tongue with			envy... I cannot wait to see his			face...				(to Data)			You are the crown jewel of my			collection. A treasure beyond			comparison.	Data stares at him. In b.g., a wall com panel BEEPS;	Varria answers it, speaking in a voice too low for us	to hear. Fajo continues:					FAJO				(a smile)			You should be flattered.					DATA			I am not. Most intelligent			lifeforms find involuntary			confinement offensive and			inequitable. Moreover, you have			violated Federation law --					FAJO				(waves it off)			Yes, I know. What I've done is			evil, selfish, immoral, illegal,			and unprincipled.				(a grin)			I've learned to live with it.	Data's mystified by Fajo's lack of concern. Fajo turns	to Varria.					VARRIA			The Andorians wish to bid for the			shipment of Tellurian spices you			offered.					FAJO			They've had four days... they			would have to make up their minds			now. Ah, well...	Fajo and Varria start for the door. Data makes one	more attempt to reason with Fajo:    STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/25/90 - ACT ONE    14.19   CONTINUED: (3)					DATA			I must emphasize, Mister Fajo,			that I consider this captivity			a hostile act on your part.					FAJO				(shrugs)			You'll get used to it.	And Fajo and Varria EXIT, leaving Data to ponder his	situation.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                             STAR TREK: "The Most Toys" - REV. 2/25/90 - ACT TWO    15.                           ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:19A  EXT.
