SHUTTLEBAY	An ALIEN SHUTTLECRAFT sits in the bay. PICARD and TROI	(Picard in his jacket, carrying a duffel bag; Troi in	dress uniform;) are facing the shuttle. Riker and Worf	are also present. Clearly, this is a very important	moment for all of them. Except for Worf, who looks	distinctly uncomfortable.	The shuttle doors OPEN and three distinctive-looking	aliens -- IYAARANS -- step out to greet the group.	AMBASSADOR LOQUEL... AMBASSADOR BYLETH... and the	shuttle's PILOT, VOVAL. All three wear featureless	clothing -- there are NO ornaments or extraneous	styling whatsoever -- it should suggest a purely	functional, utilitarian garment.	Picard steps forward to greet the Ambassadors.					PICARD			Ambassador Loquel... Ambassador			Byleth. I'm Captain Picard.			Welcome aboard the Enterprise.	The Ambassadors bow politely, a ceremonial gesture.					LOQUEL			It is our pleasure to be here,			Captain.					PICARD			We are honored to be the site of			the first cultural exchange			between the Iyaaran people and the			Federation.					BYLETH			Yes, yes. The next seven days			should prove most illuminating.	Loquel gestures toward the pilot.					LOQUEL			Allow me to introduce Voval. He			will be taking you back to our			homeworld.	Picard nods and smiles at the pilot.       STAR TREK: "Liaisons" - REV. 07/07/93 - TEASER       4.3    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Pleased to meet you.	The pilot stares back silently, a neutral expression on	his face. It throws Picard off for just a second, then --					PICARD				(to Ambassadors)			I'm looking forward to meeting			with the Premier of Iyar.4    INLCUDE WORF	as the diplomatic pleasantries continue. He is bored	stiff...					PICARD				(continuing)			There will be a reception in your			honor where you'll meet the rest			of the Senior Staff. I'll be on			my way to your home world, of			course -- but I'm leaving you in			the hands of my most experienced			officers.	He gestures toward Worf.					PICARD			Lieutenant Worf, of the Klingon			Empire, is our head of security.			He will be responsible for your			safety while you're on board.	Worf nods stiffly, and Byleth in particular takes	notice of him, staring intently. Picard moves on, but	Byleth continues to look at Worf.         STAR TREK: "Liaisons" - 07/06/93 - TEASER         4A.4    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Counselor Deanna Troi from the			Planet Betazed will be your			personal liaison, Ambassador			Loquel.	Troi smiles and steps forward.          STAR TREK: "Liaisons" - 07/06/93 - TEASER          5.4    CONTINUED: (2)					TROI			Ambassador Loquel, it's an honor			to meet you. May I show you to			your quarters before we attend the			reception?					LOQUEL			Please.	Loquel follows Troi toward the door.					PICARD			And my First Officer, Commander			William Riker from the planet			Earth, will be assigned to you,			Ambassador Byleth.					BYLETH				(looking at Worf)			I want this one.	Worf reacts to this, puzzled and surprised. Picard	looks from one to the other.					PICARD			Commander Riker is a skilled			diplomat, with wide experience in			inter-species contact --					BYLETH			I'm sure, I'm sure. But I have			decided. I want this Lieutenant			Worf.	Worf looks stricken... glances at Picard for	salvation... but Picard wants to accommodate.					PICARD			Well. That will be -- just fine.			Mister Worf... ?	There's no out. Worf takes a breath, turns to Byleth.					WORF			Yes...

Riker, Worf, Troi and	DATA are there with several other Starfleet Officers.	(They are still in their dress uniforms.) A large	BUFFET TABLE has been set-up -- it's topped with	various FOOD and DRINKS.7    ON TROI AND AMBASSADOR LOQUEL	moving along the buffet table. Troi holds an empty	plate; Loquel also holds a plate, but his is piled high	with food. As they talk, he keeps putting more food	onto his plate.					TROI			So first thing tomorrow, I thought			I'd take you on a tour... show you			the operational centers and the			residential decks of the ship.			Then after that, we could spend			some time discussing some of the			cultural underpinnings of your			society --					LOQUEL			Are you going to eat?	Troi stops.					TROI			Excuse me?	He gestures at her empty plate.					LOQUEL			You have no food on your plate.			Are you going to eat?         STAR TREK: "Liaisons" - 07/06/93 - ACT ONE         7.7    CONTINUED:					TROI			Oh... actually, I was waiting			until we got to the dessert tray.	He looks at her, not entirely clear on the concept.					LOQUEL			"Dessert... " What is that?					TROI			It's something we eat after the			main course. It's usually very			sweet... usually very bad for			you. We eat it purely for			pleasure.				(beat)			If you ask me, it's the best part			of any meal.	He considers this.					LOQUEL			My people eat only for			nourishment.	Troi leads him to the DESSERT TRAY, which is filled	with various treats. Loquel looks on with fascination.					TROI				(continuing)			Let me introduce you to some of my			favorites...				(indicates desserts)			Here we have peach cobbler with			whipped cream. Tarvokian powder			cake...				(beat)			But over here -- this is my very			favorite.	Troi indicates a dome-shaped confection half the size	of a bowling ball -- and completely covered with	chocolate.         STAR TREK: "Liaisons" - 07/06/93 - ACT ONE         8.7    CONTINUED: (2)					TROI				(continuing)			This is a Ktarian Chocolate Puff.			I'm not exactly sure what's in			it... but I think there are at			least seventeen varieties of			chocolate inside.	Troi takes a modest slice and puts it on her plate,	offers it to him. Loquel takes a small bite with his	fork... considers the taste... then reacts with intense	pleasure. He tries to find words to describe the	sensation...					LOQUEL			It is... it is...					TROI			Delicious?					LOQUEL				(smiles at the word)			"Delicious... "	Troi smiles.					TROI			Ambassador... I think we're going			to get along very well.	She gestures toward a table.					TROI			Shall we?	He nods. Troi moves toward the table to sit down.	Loquel eyes the dessert tray a moment, then innocently	picks up the entire platter of desserts and follows	Troi...8    WORF, BEVERLY AND AMBASSADOR BYLETH	sitting at a table. They all have food in front of	them. Byleth takes a bite of his food, reacts with	disgust. He shoves his plate of food toward Worf.					BYLETH			This is unacceptable.					WORF			I am sorry if you do not care for			our --         STAR TREK: "Liaisons" - 07/06/93 - ACT ONE         9.8    CONTINUED:					BYLETH			Bring me new food. I require a			higher protein and enzymatic			content.	Worf takes a beat, tries to hold his temper. Beverly	intercedes.					BEVERLY			Our custom in a situation like			this is to serve ourselves. It's			called a "buffet," and usually			people prefer to choose --					BYLETH				(to Worf, as if to a				 child)			Bring... me... new... food.	Worf rises stiffly as Beverly tries to reach Byleth.					BEVERLY			Ambassador...					WORF			It is all right, Doctor. I am			happy to bring more food.	Worf moves off to the buffet table. He picks up a long	knife and begins cutting at some meat... going at it	with a decidedly violent sub-text. Data approaches.					DATA				(to Worf)			How is your diplomatic assignment			progressing so far?					WORF				(terse)			Fine.	Data watches as Worf hacks at the meat.      STAR TREK: "Liaisons" - REV. 07/07/93 - ACT ONE      10.8    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			I have found that in moments of			diplomatic tension, it is often			helpful to find elements of			commonality.	Worf considers this for a moment.					WORF			Ambassador Byleth is...			demanding... temperamental...			rude...					DATA				(innocently)			You share all of those qualities			in abundance.

Picard is sitting next to him, trying his	best to strike up a conversation with the man. It	isn't easy.
