I just wanted to			report in. I didn't expect to			find anyone up except Data.					BEVERLY			Data's away on assignment. A			Federation deep space probe went			off course and crashed on Barkon			Four.

TOWN SQUARE - EARLY MORNING	A small village on Barkon Four. The level of	technology on this planet is roughly equivalent to that	of the Renaissance on Earth and the architecture,	tools, and clothing should reflect this. The village	has several storefronts and buildings, one of which is	the Barkonian version of a small BLACKSMITH'S SHOP with	the necessary equipment and tools out in front of it.	The other storefronts should have practical doors and	a few display tables (which are now covered by drop	cloths). There is also a WELL visible in the center of	the square.	A man named GARVIN and his young daughter GIA are	walking through the town square. The time of day is	early morning and there's no one else up at this hour.	Gia is carrying a black slate. Garvin is holding his	daughter's hand and walking her to school.					GARVIN				(to Gia)			... so when you return from school			tonight, I'll be meeting with the			Village Elders.					GIA				(disappointed)			Again?					GARVIN				(chiding)			Gia...					GIA				(downbeat)			I know.

Gia stops too and follows his	gaze... her expression also changes to one of shock as	she sees...4    DATA	Standing near the entrance to the square. His hair is	disheveled... his uniform ripped and in tatters... his	combadge gone... he's carrying a large Starfleet	CONTAINER (about the size of a briefcase) in one	hand... he looks like hell. Data opens his mouth and	tries to speak, but instead of speech, a horrible	ELECTRONIC NOISE comes out of his mouth.

TOWN SQUARE - EARLY MORNING	Continuous from the Teaser. Garvin quickly pulls Gia	away to protect her from Data. Garvin takes a couple	of steps backward.					GARVIN				(to Gia, urgent)			Gia, go home. Now.	He pushes her away and Gia runs a few steps away, but	she takes cover behind the well instead of actually	leaving. Gia peeks out from behind the well to see	what happens.					GARVIN				(continuing,				 challenging, to Data)			Who are you? What do you want?	Data thinks for a long beat... then tries to work his	mouth again... the electronic noise slowly changes from	a garbled mess to recognizable sounds.					DATA				(electronic)			Wayuman... whaaaa... yuuuu...			waaaant... what d'yuuuu... what			you want... what do you want?	Data seems genuinely confused... his tone of voice is	almost a plea for help... he's also not making any	threatening moves. Garvin's attitude loses a little of	its confrontational aspect as it becomes more clear	that Data is not going to attack him.					GARVIN			What's wrong with you?					DATA				(electronic)			Runnnn... rung... wrong wrong			wrong... what is...				(beat, then less				 electronic)			What is wrong with you?       STAR TREK: "Thine Own Self" 11/30/93 - ACT ONE       7.5    CONTINUED:					GARVIN			There's nothing wrong with me.	Data looks confused again... Garvin tries another tack.					GARVIN				(continuing)			Who are you? What is your name?				(beat)			Your name? Can you understand me?				(points at himself)			My name is Garvin.	Data thinks for a moment... then points to himself.	His voice is normal by now. His expression is	hopeful... he seems eager to learn and be understood.					DATA			My name is Garvin?	From behind the well, Gia giggles a little. Garvin	turns around with a frown.					GARVIN				(continuing)			I thought I told you to go home.					GIA				(downcast)			I know...	Data has been thinking during this conversation and now	he seems to have figured out something.					DATA			I do not know my name.	Garvin turns around to face him again.					GARVIN			What?					DATA			You asked... if I knew my name.			I do not.       STAR TREK: "Thine Own Self" 11/30/93 - ACT ONE       8.5    CONTINUED: (2)					GARVIN			Well... at least you seem to be			understanding a little more.					DATA			Yes. It is becoming... easier.					GIA			Ask him where he's from, Father.					GARVIN			Gia, go on to school. I'll deal			with the stranger.					GIA				(downcast)			Yes, Father.	She comes out from behind the well and begins to head	off in the original direction she and Garvin were	heading. She pauses for a moment and looks at Data.					GIA				(continuing)			Good-bye.					DATA			Good-bye.	Gia EXITS. Garvin moves a little closer to Data...	looks over his strange clothes and appearance.					GARVIN			Your eyes and skin look so...			strange. And your clothes... you			look like you've been in some kind			of accident.					DATA			I do not remember being in an			accident.				(beat)			But then, I do not remember very			much at all.					GARVIN			What do you remember?					DATA			I walked here... from the			mountains.       STAR TREK: "Thine Own Self" 11/30/93 - ACT ONE       9.5    CONTINUED: (3)					GARVIN				(amazed)			The mountains? The mountains are			over two hundred seltons from			here.					DATA			I do have a clear memory of my			journey. It began on a steep path			in the mountains... near a large			waterfall with two jagged			promontories.					GARVIN			There are several large waterfalls			up in those mountains...				(beat)			What do you remember before that?					DATA			I have no prior memories.	Garvin looks at him for another moment... then the	container in Data's hand catches his attention.					GARVIN				(re: container)			Do you know what that is?	Data looks down in surprise as if noticing it for the	first time.					DATA			No.					GARVIN				(reaching out for it)			May I?	Data looks at him for a moment.					GARVIN				(continuing)			May I have it?					DATA				(understanding)			Yes.	Data hands it to him and Garvin sets it on a nearby	table.       STAR TREK: "Thine Own Self" 11/30/93 - ACT ONE       10.5    CONTINUED: (4)					GARVIN			There might be something in here			that can tell us who you are.	Garvin bends down and examines the container for a	moment.6    CLOSE ON CONTAINER	On the lid of the container, there is a Starfleet logo	and 24th century radiation symbol. It is also clearly	marked "RADIOACTIVE."7    RESUME SCENE					GARVIN			I wonder what these markings			mean...					DATA				(reading)			"Radioactive."					GARVIN			What?					DATA			That is what is written on the			container.					GARVIN			You can read this language?					DATA			Evidently.					GARVIN			Radioactive... what does that			mean?					DATA			I do not know.

RIKER'S QUARTERS	RIKER is practicing a difficult piece of music on his	trombone, when the door to his quarters OPENS and Troi	ENTERS. She quietly moves to a chair so as not to	interrupt him. He finishes the piece and then looks	over at her expectantly. He plays a couple of notes on	the trombone which sort of emulate a "voice" -- the	notes and the expression on his face communicate the	words "how's that?" She smiles.					TROI			Is that supposed to be a question?	He plays a note that sounds like "yeah."					TROI				(continuing)			Well, if you're asking me if I			liked what you were playing, then			the answer is yes.	Riker plays "thank you."					TROI				(continuing)			And I think this is a much better			way of communicating for you.			It's much less... confusing than			when you try to speak normally.	Riker plays a loud sour note and then sets the trombone	aside.					RIKER			I can always count on the ship's			Counselor to boost my self-image.					TROI			Glad to be of service.					RIKER			Did you come here for something in			particular, or just for some			general Riker-bashing?       STAR TREK: "Thine Own Self" 11/30/93 - ACT TWO       13.9    CONTINUED:					TROI			I'd actually like your opinion on			something.				(beat)			I've been thinking about taking			the Bridge Officer's test and			becoming a full commander.	Riker's a little surprised and it shows. He sits down	across from her.					RIKER			What brought this up?					TROI			A lot of things... working on last			month's personnel review...			talking with Beverly about her			experiences... going to my class			reunion...					RIKER			Ah, the class reunion... saw a few			old friends who'd taken the			test... ?					TROI			All right, I'll admit that was a			catalyst.

HOME - DAY	A small home with a living room, a staircase, and a	dining room. Again, the furniture and decor should be	very pre-industrial, along the lines of a 15th century	Italian villa. There should be a couch large enough	for a person to recline on.	Data is sitting on a chair in the middle of the main	room. TALUR, a woman in her mid-forties, is examining	Data. She's the town healer and probably the most	educated person in the village... she's also very	aware of this fact and Talur can be quite pompous and	self-important. Garvin looks on as Talur peers into	Data's open mouth with a tongue depressor.       STAR TREK: "Thine Own Self" 11/30/93 - ACT TWO       15.10   CONTINUED:					TALUR			Hmmmm.

But you say			you feel fine?					DATA			That is correct.					TALUR			No headaches... palpitations...			sluggishness... indigestion...					DATA			No. However, I cannot have			indigestion since I have not			eaten.					TALUR			When was your last meal?					DATA			I do not know.					TALUR			Ah. Malnutrition. You should try			to eat something that will build			strength and return your			vitality... lots of meat...			butter... cheese... that should			be a start.       STAR TREK: "Thine Own Self" 11/30/93 - ACT TWO       16.10   CONTINUED: (2)					GARVIN			What about his eyes and his skin?			They're so... odd.					TALUR				(self-important)			Oh, quite so, quite so.

You probably come from a			race of people who live in the			snow and ice of the Vellorian			mountains. Your skin and eye			coloration are most likely a			result of prolonged exposure to			the harsh winter conditions.					DATA			Then I am not ill?					TALUR			Other than your memory loss, you			don't have symptoms of any illness			that I'm familiar with.

Gia ENTERS just as Talur EXITS.					TALUR			Hello, Gia.					GIA			Hello.	Gia goes to her father with an eager expression.					GIA				(continuing)			What did Talur say about him? Is			he sick?					GARVIN			Not exactly. She said he's lost			his memory, but seems to be fine			otherwise. Talur thinks he is			from a race that lives in the			mountains.					DATA			I am an ice-man.					GARVIN			We'll have to call you something			besides Ice-man until your memory			returns.

Skoran is a large,	burly man with powerful arms and what seems like a	permanent scowl on his face. Data is standing nearby	and he continues to draw curious looks from passersby	in the b.g. during the conversation.

Behind them an APPRENTICE is pounding metal	on an ANVIL of alien design which is supported by a	wooden base. Skoran is examining one of the pieces.					SKORAN				(to Data)			You.

Skoran	takes a pair of tongs and a hammer from his Apprentice	and POUNDS the fragment for a moment. The fragment	flattens out on the anvil. Skoran scowls at it for a	long moment.	They move away from the anvil and the Apprentice goes	back to work.					SKORAN			It's obviously been tempered and			milled... but the lusterous			quality of the metal is so pure...			this wasn't made in any forge I've			ever seen.					(MORE)    STAR TREK: "Thine Own Self" REV. 12/07/93 - ACT TWO    20.11   CONTINUED: (2)					SKORAN (Cont'd)				(beat)			Will you sell them?					GARVIN			You want them?					SKORAN				(shrugs)			The metal's malleable enough to			make some jewelry.					GARVIN			They belong to Jayden.				(to Data)			Do you want to sell them?
