Wesley is	wearing his cadet uniform and is carrying a suitcase.					BEVERLY			Here you go... your very own			quarters.				(with humor)			And they're as far away from mine			as possible, so you won't even			have to see me if you don't want			to.	Wes rolls his eyes slightly as he starts to unpack.					WESLEY			Mom... you know that's not why I			asked for my own quarters this --					BEVERLY				(teasing)			No, no. You don't have to			explain. There comes a time in a			young man's life when he doesn't			want to stay with his poor old			mother... I understand.        STAR TREK: "Journey's End" 01/20/94 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:					WESLEY				(wry)			I'll come visit you in the old			Doctor's Home every Sunday.	Beverly smiles... she's very happy, very up and Wes	seems glad to be home... but throughout the scene, we	should get the first subtle indications that all is not	well with Wesley... he may be smiling and saying all	the right things, but his smile is just a little	forced... his good cheer a little hollow. The door	CHIMES.					WESLEY			Come in.	GEORDI and DATA ENTER.					GEORDI			Is there a runaway cadet in here?					DATA			If so, we may have to call			security.					GEORDI			Welcome back, Wes.					WESLEY			Thanks.	Wesley's response is perfunctory at best and he gives	them a polite smile.					DATA			I was, of course, not serious			about calling security. It was a			joke.					WESLEY			I got it, Data.	Geordi picks up on the distance Wesley is keeping them	at and he struggles for meaningless small talk.					GEORDI			So... how's life at the Academy?					WESLEY			Great... just great.				(beat)			But it's... good to have a break.      STAR TREK: "Journey's End" REV. 01/24/94 - TEASER      3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			So do you plan on just lounging			around while we have work to do?					WESLEY			I'm... sure I can find some time			to help, sir.	Geordi laughs a little at the serious look on Wesley's	face and then puts a friendly hand on his shoulder.					GEORDI			Enjoy your time off, you've earned			it.					WESLEY			Thanks.					BEVERLY			Well... I think we better let him			settle in.					GEORDI			Good idea. Don't sleep your whole			vacation away, Wes.      STAR TREK: "Journey's End" REV. 01/24/94 - TEASER      4.2    CONTINUED: (3)					DATA			Good-bye.					WESLEY			See you later.	Data and Geordi EXIT. Beverly gives her son a long hug	for a moment.					BEVERLY			It's really good to have you home,			Wesley. Really.					WESLEY			Thanks, Mom.	Beverly EXITS. Wes moves back to his suitcase and	takes out a shirt... then pauses and sits down on the	bed. He looks around the room for a moment... there is	no joy in his face, no sense of warm nostalgia or	relief at being home... just the look of young man	who's profoundly unhappy... and doesn't even know why.	OFF his expression...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  STAR TREK: "Journey's End" 01/20/94 - ACT ONE        5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            3    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	PICARD is setting a teapot on the table where a small	tea service has been laid out. There is also a plate	of small sandwiches, and a tray of odd-looking	crackers. Riker ENTERS.					RIKER			Admiral Necheyev's just beamed			aboard. Worf's escorting her up			here now.					PICARD			Good.	Picard makes a few adjustments to the tea service as	Riker looks on.					RIKER			Earl Grey Tea... watercress			sandwiches... Bularian canapes...			Are you up for a promotion?					PICARD			I'm trying to establish a new			relationship with the Admiral.			There's been a certain amount			of... tension between us in the			past.					RIKER			Tension's not the word I would			use...					PICARD			I'd like to get things started on			a better note this time. I want			to make her feel at ease... that			she's welcome aboard the			Enterprise...					RIKER				(innocent)			I don't know why she wouldn't feel			welcome here.	Picard gives him a dry look.        STAR TREK: "Journey's End" 01/20/94 - ACT ONE        6.3    CONTINUED:					PICARD			We don't have to like her Wil, we			simply have to follow her orders.			However, maintaining an atmosphere			of confrontation serves no			purpose.	The doors now OPEN and WORF and ADMIRAL NECHEYEV ENTER.	Necheyev is carrying a PADD.					WORF			Admiral Necheyev, sir.	Picard smiles warmly and moves to shake her hand.					PICARD				(warm)			Admiral, welcome aboard the			Enterprise.	But Necheyev is as brusque as ever.					NECHEYEV			Thank you.				(to Worf & Riker)			You two may leave.	Worf bristles slightly, but Riker simply smiles at her.					RIKER			Thank you, Admiral.	Riker gives Picard a big smile... "you've got your work	cut out for you."					RIKER			Captain...	Riker and Worf EXIT. Picard tries gamely to play the	gracious host.					PICARD			Admiral, may I offer you some --	But Necheyev is all business... she moves past Picard	and heads for the table without even hearing him.					NECHEYEV				(brusque)			I'll come right to the point,			Captain. A situation has			developed on the Cardassian border			that...        STAR TREK: "Journey's End" 01/20/94 - ACT ONE        7.3    CONTINUED: (2)	She trails off as she catches sight of the food and	drink on the table.					NECHEYEV			Are those... Bularian canapes?					PICARD			Yes, as a matter of fact. I took			the liberty of speaking to your			aide, Commander Wrightwell... he			said you were quite fond of them.	Necheyev suddenly realizes the effort that Picard has	gone to here... she reins in her instinctive "cut to	the chase" attitude with Picard... tries to match his	gesture with a certain amount of graciousness. But it	isn't easy -- for either of them, and there is still a	trace of tension between these two officers as they try	to remain civil to each other throughout the scene.					NECHEYEV			That was very... thoughtful,			Captain. Thank you.	She sits down and takes one of the canapes. Picard	pours them both some tea.					PICARD			You were saying something about			the Cardassians I believe...					NECHEYEV			Yes. The Federation has just			completed a very long and			difficult series of negotiations			regarding the final status of our			border with the Cardassians.	Necheyev hands Picard the PADD she brought in.					NECHEYEV				(continuing)			These will be the official			boundaries... you'll notice that			a demilitarized zone has also been			created along the border. Neither			side will be permitted to place			military outposts, conduct fleet			exercises, or station warships			anywhere in the demilitarized			area.        STAR TREK: "Journey's End" 01/20/94 - ACT ONE        8.3    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD				(off PADD)			This border will put several			Federation colonies in Cardassian			territory... and some Cardassian			colonies in ours.	Necheyev sips some tea... she's not completely happy	with this agreement.					NECHEYEV			The agreement is by no means			perfect... neither side got			everything they wanted... but			everyone got something. And as			someone once said, diplomacy is			the art of the possible.				(beat)			Those colonies finding themselves			on the wrong side of the border			will have to be moved.	Picard doesn't like the sound of that.					PICARD			The colonists are not going to be			very happy about that... some of			them have been there for decades.					NECHEYEV			It won't be easy... but it is a			reasonable price to pay for peace.				(beat)			Your mission is to evacuate the			colony on Dorvan Five.					PICARD			Dorvan Five... that's where the			group of North American Indians			has settled, isn't it?					NECHEYEV			Yes. They've been there for about			twenty years... they've			established a village in a small			valley on the southern continent.        STAR TREK: "Journey's End" 01/20/93 - ACT ONE        9.3    CONTINUED: (4)	Picard sits back in his chair... very disturbed by	this. Necheyev is vaguely irritated -- she doesn't	respond well to resistance from her subordinates, but	she holds her tongue and gives him a polite smile.					NECHEYEV			Is there something wrong?					PICARD				(continuing)			Admiral... centuries ago, the			North American Indians were			forcibly displaced from their			ancestral lands. This group on			Dorvan Five originally left Earth			two hundred years ago because they			wanted to preserve their cultural			identities.					NECHEYEV				(dry)			I am aware of that Captain...					PICARD			There are certain... disturbing			historical parallels here. Once			again, these people are being			asked to leave their homes because			of political decisions made by a			distant government.	Necheyev nearly gives him a tart reply, but instead,	she takes a sip of her tea... trying to maintain the	civil atmosphere.					NECHEYEV			An Indian representative was			included in the deliberations of			the Federation Council. His			objections were noted,			discussed... but ultimately			rejected.	Necheyev leans forward, trying to make Picard see the	validity of her position... trying to make him	understand.       STAR TREK: "Journey's End" 01/20/93 - ACT ONE       9A.3    CONTINUED: (5)					NECHEYEV				(continuing)			Captain, the Indians colonized			Dorvan only twenty years ago...			and at that time they were warned			the planet was hotly disputed by			the Cardassians. The bottom line			is... they never should have			settled there in the first place.					PICARD			Then perhaps we should not have			allowed them to settle the planet			originally. But to go to them			twenty years later and ask them to			leave what is now their home...	Necheyev sits back in her chair and regards him for a	moment... her expression is weary... tired.					NECHEYEV			I made the same argument to the			Federation Council. But it took			three years to negotiate this			treaty... some concessions had to			be made... and this is one of			them.	Picard takes a moment... realizes the futility of	further argument.					PICARD			What if the Indians should...			refuse to evacuate?	Necheyev sets down her tea... gives him a direct look.					NECHEYEV				(quiet)			Then your orders are to remove			them... by any means necessary.	That grim order hangs in the air for a moment.       STAR TREK: "Journey's End" 01/20/94 - ACT ONE       9B.3    CONTINUED: (6)					NECHEYEV				(continuing)			I understand your... moral			objections, Captain. If you			wish... I can find someone else to			command the Enterprise for this			mission.					PICARD			No. That won't be necessary.	Necheyev nods and then she stands. Picard stands as	well.					NECHEYEV			I don't envy you this task... but			I do believe it is for the greater			good.					PICARD			I understand.	Necheyev turns to go, then pauses at the door.					NECHEYEV			And... thank you for...				(beat, looks down at the				 food & tea)			... making me feel welcome.					PICARD			You are always welcome on this			ship, Admiral.	A look between two former adversaries possibly on the	road to a new relationship... and then Necheyev EXITS.									CUT TO:4    EXT.

His things are	scattered across the floor -- not the neat and tidy	room one would expect from a Starfleet Cadet. The door	CHIMES. Wes groans and rolls over, trying to ignore	it. The door CHIMES again. Wesley finally sits up in	irritation.					WESLEY				(annoyed)			Come in.	The doors OPEN and Picard ENTERS. He's surprised to	see Wesley still in bed.					PICARD			Oh. I'm sorry to disturb you,			Mister Crusher. I assumed you			would be up at this hour. I could			come back later.	Wesley drags himself out of bed and puts on a robe. He	makes a feeble effort to perk up for the Captain.					WESLEY			No... no, sir. I... must have			overslept. Come in.	Picard comes in as Wesley goes to the replicator.					WESLEY				(continuing, to				 replicator)			Coffee, black.	We HEAR the sound of the replicator. Wesley seems to	remember something.					WESLEY				(continuing, to Picard)			Oh. Uh, can I get something for			you, sir?					PICARD			No, that's quite all right. This			was my first chance to welcome you			back.	Wesley takes a sip from the steaming mug.					WESLEY			Thank you. I appreciate that.	There is an awkward beat. The usual warm and familiar	dynamic between them is noticeably absent.     STAR TREK: "Journey's End" REV. 01/24/94 - ACT ONE     11.5    CONTINUED:	Wesley never quite meets Picard's gaze... he's	withdrawn and evasive. He really doesn't want to be	here and he doesn't particularly want to talk to the	Captain -- he just wants to be left alone. Picard	feels progressively more uncomfortable.					PICARD			So... how's Boothby?	Wesley shrugs.					WESLEY			Fine, I guess.					PICARD			You guess?					WESLEY			I haven't seen him in a while.				(beat)			To be honest, sir...

I hope you enjoy			your vacation. That's really all			I came here to say.	Picard turns and EXITS. Wesley feels instantly bad...	he didn't mean to rude... and now it's too late.

Well, feast			your eyes on this.	Wesley looks inside the panel -- there's a pulsing	conduit inside. Wesley looks unimpressed -- his	attitude is condescending, almost arrogant. The	subtext here is that Wesley is angry and frustrated	about something and he's taking those feelings out on	Geordi.					WESLEY				(dismissive)			You've only got one micro-fusion			inter-relay in here... the			converter interface will never			hold up.					GEORDI			Hey, I ran the diagnostics myself.			This little baby will withstand			over five hundred Cochranes of			warp field stress.					WESLEY			I don't think so. You better put			a secondary phase inverter in			there.				(beat, pokes around in				 panel)			In fact, this entire subprocessor			matrix needs an overhaul.	Geordi shuts the panel... he's definitely getting	irritated at this point.					GEORDI			Well, I guess we can't have all			the fancy new equipment they give			you kids at the Academy. We have			to make do with what we've got.	Wesley reacts with irritation, as if talking to a slow	pupil who just doesn't get it.     STAR TREK: "Journey's End" REV. 01/24/94 - ACT ONE     14.6    CONTINUED: (2)					WESLEY			Read the latest paper by Doctor			Vassbinder... he has some			brilliant new theories on warp			propulsion inter-relays.				(indicates console)			A lot of this stuff is almost			obsolete.	Wesley's tone and attitude are so obviously out of	character that Geordi gives him a surprised look.					GEORDI			What's wrong with you?					WESLEY				(hard)			Do you want my help or not?					GEORDI				(bristling)			I was doing this for you...

MEETING ROOM	A large room, which in contrast to the rest of the	village is almost completely 24th century in design and	in building materials. There is a large, broad table	with chairs, but no other furniture. Seated on one	side of the table are five leaders of the Indian Tribal	Council -- each of them wearing distinctive	accoutrements which indicate their respective tribes,	but all in essentially modern dress. On the other side	of the table are seated Picard and Troi. The	atmosphere is cordial, but a little stiff. There are	several PADDS on the table.	Picard is speaking to ANTHWARA -- the Leader of the	Tribal Council.					PICARD			Anthwara... I am afraid there is			very little I can do. The			decision regarding this planet was			made at the highest levels of the			Federation.     STAR TREK: "Journey's End" REV. 01/24/94 - ACT TWO     18.9    CONTINUED:					WAKASA			A decision that was made over our			explicit objections.					PICARD			I must point out that when you			first came to this world, you were			warned that it was the subject of			a dispute between the Federation			and the Cardassians. You were			asked not to settle here.					WAKASA				(with an edge)			Do you know how long we have			searched for a home? Almost two			hundred years. Then we found this			world... Can you blame us for not			wanting to give it up?					PICARD			I understand and respect the long			journey of your people. But I			believe we can help you find a new			home.	Troi picks up the PADD in front of her and Picard.					TROI			As you can see, there are three			other planets in this sector that			have environmental conditions			similar to those here on Dorvan			Five. They are all uninhabited...			and could be colonized			immediately.					PICARD			And if those worlds don't meet			with your approval, then we'll			find you other choices.       STAR TREK: "Journey's End" 01/20/94 - ACT TWO       19.9    CONTINUED: (2)	The Tribal leaders look over their PADDS for a moment,	then put them aside.

"environmental conditions."			There were other... more			intangible concerns as well.				(beat)			My people have always had an...			intimate bond with nature. We			think of ourselves as being a part			of it... and it being a part of			us. One of the reasons our			ancestors left Earth two hundred			years ago was because that bond			had been severed.					WAKASA				(with contempt)			They began to control the weather.					ANTHWARA			We believe -- very strongly --			that nature should not be "fixed"			or controlled. Droughts and			floods... tornadoes and			hurricanes... these are natural			events. By putting man above			nature... an imbalance was			created. We could no longer live			in harmony with our environment.					PICARD			I can assure you that we will not			impose a weather control system or			anything else on your people.			Whatever world you choose to			colonize will be completely yours			to do with as you please.         STAR TREK: "Journey's End" REV. 01/24/94 - ACT TWO         19A9    CONTINUED: (3)					ANTHWARA			Captain, once the bond between us			and Earth had been broken, we had			to find a planet where we could			establish a new bond... a planet			that would welcome us. When I			came here twenty years ago, I was			welcomed by the mountains... the			rivers... the sky.					WAKASA				(to Anthwara, re:				 Picard)			He's laughing at you, Anthwara.			He thinks you're talking about old			superstition and nonsense.					PICARD			That's not true. I have a great			deal of respect for your beliefs			and the meaning they hold for your			people.					ANTHWARA			Then you should respect the fact			that this planet holds a deeply			spiritual significance for us. It			took us two centuries to find a			place where the mountains gave us			permission to use their stone for			our houses... where the rivers let			us drink from their waters... and			where the wind sang to us at			night.				(beat)			We don't want to spend another two			hundred years searching for what			we already have.	Picard sits back for a moment... this is going nowhere	fast. Troi senses that further discussion will not	help.					TROI			Captain, may I suggest that we			adjourn for now... allow us all			time to think about what's been			said.	Picard looks to Anthwara, who nods after a beat.    STAR TREK: "Journey's End" REV. 01/24/94 - ACT TWO     19B-20      9    CONTINUED: (4)					ANTHWARA			Agreed.

Midconversation.					PICARD			... so I've been trying to			familiarize myself with the			history and traditions of your			people. I was quite interested to			learn that it was your grandfather --			Katowa -- who led the group of			Indians who initially left Earth			two centuries ago.					ANTHWARA				(with affection)			He was a... great man. When I was			a little boy, I was so proud to			know that he was my grandfather.			In fact, I think I was a little			too proud of it... I remember the			other children getting tired of			hearing me talk about him.					PICARD			It must have been a very difficult			decision for your grandfather to			make... uprooting your people...			leading them into the unknown for			an undetermined amount of time...			not even knowing if you ever would			find a new home.					ANTHWARA			There was great deal of			opposition. Even my own father			was against it... but when Katowa			made his decision -- that was it.			My father never said another word.	Picard pauses for a moment, and they both sip their	drinks for a second.       STAR TREK: "Journey's End" 01/20/94 - ACT TWO       25.15   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(quiet)			It's never easy to leave one's			home... to give up the safe and			familiar. But there are times			when the greater good demands that			sacrifices be made... I'm sure			your grandfather knew that.	Anthwara looks out at the stars for a moment.					ANTHWARA				(quiet)			His grandson does too. But there			are also times when a people have			sacrificed too much... when they			must hold on to what they have...			even if it means standing up			against overwhelming opposition.	A quiet beat and then Anthwara turns to Picard and	moves the conversation onto a new subject.					ANTHWARA			What do you know about your			family, Captain?					PICARD			A great deal actually. My father			was a strong believer in passing			along the family history and			traditions.					ANTHWARA			Tell me about your family. We			have very strong ties to our			ancestors... we believe their			actions guide us even now.			Knowing more about your family			might help me to better understand			you.				(smiles)			Besides, it's always a good idea			to understand your opponent in any			negotiation.    STAR TREK: "Journey's End" REV. 01/21/94 - ACT TWO    25A.15   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD				(smiles)			I hope that by the end of this			matter, you won't look at me as			your opponent.				(beat)			My family.

What are your orders?			Can we open fire?	Evek finally hits the combadge.					GUL EVEK			Evek to the Vetar... lock on to			our troops on the surface... and			beam them aboard.					CARDASSIAN COM VOICE			But sir, they have been fired upon			and --					GUL EVEK				(harsh)			Those are my orders. Carry them			out.					CARDASSIAN COM VOICE			Yes, sir.					GUL EVEK			I had three sons, Captain. I lost			two of them in the war. I don't			want to lose the last one.					PICARD				(to Riker)			Beam up our Away Team immediately,			Number One.					RIKER			Aye, sir.	OFF Picard's look of relief...									CUT TO:         STAR TREK: "Journey's End" REV. 01/21/94 - ACT FIVE        62.41   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship in orbit.42   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Picard, Gul Evek, and Anthwara are seated at the table.					PICARD			Anthwara... I want to make			absolutely sure you understand the			implications of this agreement.			By giving up your status as			Federation citizens... any future			request you or your people make			for assistance from Starfleet will			go unanswered. You will be on			your own... and under Cardassian			jurisdiction.					ANTHWARA			I understand, Captain. And we are			prepared to take that risk.				(to Gul Evek)			Will the Cardassian government			honor the agreement you've made			here?					GUL EVEK			I believe that I can convince them			this is an... equitable solution.			I cannot speak for every			Cardassian you will encounter...			but if you leave us alone... I			suspect that we will do the same.				(to Picard)			Will this be acceptable to			Starfleet Command?					PICARD			It will take some doing... but			with Admiral Necheyev's support,			I think they'll go along with it			in the end.					GUL EVEK				(stands)			Then if there is nothing else, I			will return to my ship. I have a			rather... long report to write.			Captain... Anthwara...	Gul Evek EXITS. Anthwara stands to follow him, then	turns to Picard.         STAR TREK: "Journey's End" REV. 01/21/94 - ACT FIVE        63.42   CONTINUED:					ANTHWARA			I was right, Captain... you didn't			take us from our land... and you			have wiped clean a very old stain			of blood.	Anthwara then EXITS.

A quiet beat between Picard and	Beverly. She smiles at him... grateful for him just	being here. He puts his arm in hers and they head for	the doors.
