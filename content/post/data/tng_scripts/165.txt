SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND KLINGON SHIP (OPTICAL)	The two ships facing each other (STOCK FOOTAGE).					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 43685.2			As part of a continuing exchange			program, the Enterprise is taking			aboard a Klingon officer to return			the recent visit of Commander			Riker to the cruiser Pagh.2    INT. CORRIDOR	PICARD and RIKER are walking along the corridor toward	the Transporter Room.					PICARD			We must take care that while he			is with us, Commander Kurn is			accorded all the rights and			responsibilities due the first			officer of this ship. If he			should feel patronized in any			way...					RIKER			We'd know about it, sir. One does			not patronize a Klingon warrior.					PICARD			I'm quite sure your experience			aboard the Pagh will prove			invaluable during the commander's			tour. Be sure that the crew is			prepared for any... unusual			orders.					RIKER			The Klingons are very thorough,			Captain. I'm sure Commander Kurn			has studied for his assignment			with us just as I studied to serve			with them.      STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - 1/5/90 - TEASER      2.2    CONTINUED:					PICARD				(acknowledges)			I understand that he specifically			requested the Enterprise...	Moving into --3    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Picard and Riker ENTER. TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN is	waiting at the console.					TECHNICIAN			Commander Kurn is ready for			transport, Captain.					PICARD			Energize.	The Technician works the console and the Transporter	EFFECT begins. Kurn materializes on the stage. Kurn	is clad in full Klingon regalia... he bears a striking	resemblance to Worf and is about the same age. Picard	and Riker step forward in greeting.					PICARD			Welcome aboard the Enterprise,			Commander. I am Captain Picard.	Kurn steps off the stage. There is a slightly awkward	moment as Kurn remembers the human custom of greeting.	He hesitates only briefly and then extends his hand.	Picard smiles and shakes his hand. Kurn responds	politely, but it sounds rehearsed and stilted.					KURN			Thank... you, Captain. I am ready			for duty.					PICARD			This is Commander William Riker			who will be yielding the first			officer's position to you during			your tour...					KURN				(to Riker)			You are relieved.				(to Picard)			May I take my station, Captain?      STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - 1/5/90 - TEASER      3.3    CONTINUED:	Picard and Riker react to the Klingon's impatience.					RIKER			I thought that I might show you			your quarters...	Riker stops as he sees fire come to Kurn's eyes	struggling to keep his temper.					KURN				(to Picard)			I am ready for duty, sir. I ask			that I be allowed to take my			station.	Picard and Riker exchange a glance.					PICARD			Very well... If you will			accompany us to the bridge...	They head for the door. There is a slight moment of	awkwardness as Riker almost goes through the door ahead	of Kurn. Riker catches himself and allows Kurn to go	first. Kurn glares at this near-breach of protocol,	but says nothing.4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	WESLEY at Conn, WORF at Tactical, DATA in Command. Picard,	Riker and Kurn ENTER from the turbolift. Picard leads	Kurn down into the Command area. Everyone watches to	see the reaction as Worf and Kurn see each other for	the first time. Worf is uncomfortable. Kurn runs his	eyes over him... silently taking his measure of Worf...	then looks away as if he'd seen nothing worth his time.					PICARD			May I present your bridge crew...	And it is a question, so Kurn feels free to answer --					KURN			Unnecessary, Captain. I am			prepared to take command.					PICARD				(reacts)			Proceed.      STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - 1/5/90 - TEASER      4.4    CONTINUED:					KURN				(to the crew)			I am Kurn, commander rank, Klingon			Defense Force. You will address			me as "Commander" or "sir" at all			times.	Moving about the bridge... making strong, challenging	eye contact... bellicose...					KURN			I am fully aware of all Starfleet			regulations. They will be			strictly adhered to by all			personnel while I am in command.			It is my intention to bring a			sense of discipline that you may			not be accustomed to.	The last is said at Worf... then to Picard --					KURN				(continuing)			With your permission, of course,			Captain.	Picard rather enjoys this, covers it.					PICARD			By all means, Commander.	Wesley throws a do-you-believe-this glance to Riker.	Kurn notices, moves face to face with Wesley...					KURN			Do you wish to speak, Acting			Ensign Wesley Crusher?	Wesley is surprised that he knows his name.					WESLEY			Nosir, Commander, sir.					KURN				(to the crew)			I have studied all your service			records. Impressive. We shall			see if you live up to your			reputations. The crew awaits your			orders, Captain.   STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - REV. 1/8/90 - TEASER   5.4    CONTINUED: (2)	Picard looks around the bridge and sees his crew	sitting straight, alert, indeed ready. Picard swallows	a grin and sits in the captain's chair. It takes Kurn	a couple seconds to realize where his place is, but	then sits down with confidence in Riker's accustomed	seat. Riker moves to the seat on the other side of	Picard.					PICARD				(casually)			Take us into the outer cometary			cloud, Commander.					KURN				(booming)			Set course one-one-four, mark			two-three-zero, one-third impulse			power!					WESLEY				(works console)			Aye sir.					KURN			Execute!				(Wesley works furiously)			Execute!					WESLEY				(a little rattled)			Engaged. Increasing to one-third			impulse power, sir.	Kurn grunts and shakes his head. As Picard sits back,	even faced, knowing we're in for an interesting ride...									CUT TO:5    EXT.

TEN FORWARD	Riker ENTERS, sees Wesley at a table and goes over to	him. Wesley is staring into space with a look of	unhappiness on his face.					RIKER			Mind if I join you?					WESLEY			No, sir.					RIKER				(sits down)			Something wrong, Wesley?					WESLEY			No, sir.					RIKER				(beat)			Commander Kurn perhaps?					WESLEY			He... just doesn't seem to like			me, sir. I can't do anything			right for him. Every time I			respond to one of his orders...			he jumps down my throat. I'm not			sure what I'm doing wrong.					RIKER			He's just...	Riker's voice trails off as he notices that GEORDI has	just come up to the table looking outraged.					RIKER			Problem, Geordi?	Geordi hesitates slightly, he doesn't really want to	bother Riker with his problems, but he's clearly at the	end of his rope.					GEORDI			Well, sir... it's our new first			officer.     STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - 1/5/90 - ACT ONE     7.7    CONTINUED:					RIKER				(can't help but smile)			I take it he found something wrong			in Engineering?					GEORDI				(exasperated)			Just the entire section. He made			a surprise inspection in the			middle of a maintenance cycle!			I tried to explain to him, but...					RIKER			He wouldn't listen.					GEORDI			We're all going to be doing double			shifts to get things ready for			the next inspection.					RIKER				(to both of them)			His style of command is just			different. Klingons believe in			a strict formality of command and			obedience.					GEORDI			But this isn't a Klingon ship.			He's got to loosen up a little,			Commander.					WESLEY			It's not just us. He's leaning			pretty hard on everybody except...				(hesitates)	Off Riker's look...					GEORDI			Except the one guy who wouldn't			mind it...8    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON WORF	Kurn in Command, Worf at his station.					WORF			Sensors picking up asteroidal			debris ahead, Commander.   STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - REV. 1/7/90 - ACT ONE   8.8    CONTINUED:					KURN			Can you identify the coordinates,			Mister Worf?	Kurn stands up and moves up the ramp to the Tactical	station.					WORF			Bearing zero-zero-one, mark			point-oh-three, range three			hundred thousand kilometers.					KURN			Excellent. Please scan the			asteroid field for me, Lieutenant,			and report.					WORF			Approximately two thousand small			objects, none in our direct flight			path, sir.	Kurn is now standing near Worf. Kurn's attitude is	easy, gentle, almost as if he thinks he might bruise	Worf if he isn't careful. As Kurn's manner becomes	more soothing and polite, Worf slowly begins to	overheat at this treatment.					KURN			So, no course correction is			necessary, is that what you're			saying?					WORF				(tightly)			It should not be needed,			Commander.					KURN			Very good, Lieutenant. You			handled that well.	This is too much for Worf. He looks sharply at Kurn.	Kurn notices... challenging --					KURN			Yes?	Worf looks away from Kurn... stares straight ahead.	Kurn studies him for a moment.   STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT ONE   9.8AA	EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Cruising at one-third impulse.8A   INT. TURBOLIFT	Riker is inside as the door opens and Kurn ENTERS.					RIKER				(greeting)			Commander.	Kurn nods an acknowledgement...					RIKER			Captain's mess... ?					KURN			Yes.					RIKER				(to computer)			Resume.	The doors shut and they proceed. A beat of silence	for a few steps before Riker decides to bring up what's	been on his mind.					RIKER			Your knowledge of our systems and			procedures is very impressive...				(off his look)			...Sir.	Getting a little tired of this...					RIKER			I would like to make one			suggestion, sir.					KURN			A suggestion...	Friendly, charming --					RIKER			When I served aboard the Pagh,			the hardest part for me was in			recognizing and adapting to the			demands of the crew. They needed			an iron hand. They wanted it.					(MORE)  STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT ONE  10.8A   CONTINUED:					RIKER (Cont'd)			I can imagine how difficult it			must be for you to work with a			crew that is so different. I'd			be happy to guide you in this			regard if it would be helpful.					KURN				(beat)			No. It wouldn't.	The door opens. As Kurn begins to exit...					RIKER				(a little burned)			This is not a Klingon ship, sir.	Kurn pauses, glances threateningly back at Riker --					KURN			No, Commander, it is not. If it			were a Klingon ship, I would have			killed you for offering your...			"suggestion".	And EXITS. Riker reacts...8B   INT. CAPTAIN'S DINING ROOM - CLOSE ON A ROASTEDTURKEY (REPLICATED)	As a hand puts a carving knife to work... and pull back	to see Picard in a chef's apron, carving at the head of	an elaborate buffet table. Kurn observes, in line near	Geordi.					KURN				(concerned)			How long has the bird been dead?			It appears to have been lying in			the sun for some time.					GEORDI				(reacts)			It's not really dead, it's			replicated. But you do understand			we... cook many of our foods...  STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - REV. 1/8/90 - ACT ONE  10A.8B   CONTINUED:					KURN			Ah yes... I was told to prepare			for that... I will try some of			your burned replicated bird meat.  STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - REV. 1/7/90 - ACT ONE  11.8B   CONTINUED: (2)	Picard puts a slice on his plate.					PICARD			I have attempted to select a menu			that will allow you to sample a			variety of dishes, Commander.	And indeed, the table is filled with a variety of	foods... and garnished with a beautiful flower	centerpiece... all the senior officers are there,	filling up their plates... Riker, Geordi, Worf,	BEVERLY, TROI, Data. Mozart is playing in the	background.					BEVERLY			Try some caviar...					KURN			The odor is not palatable. What			is it?					DATA			The unhatched eggs of a large			scaleless fish.	Kurn reacts, are you serious... ?					PICARD			It is from the Caspian Sea on			Earth, Commander. A delicacy and			a personal favorite of mine. Our			replicators have never done it			justice. I managed to store a			few cases aboard for special			occasions...	Kurn reluctantly takes some.					KURN				(dubious)			I am honored, Captain.	And as he decides to finish this process of collecting	the Earth foods, he takes a good sampling of the	flowers from the centerpiece and puts them on his	plate.8C   ANGLE - THE DINNER TABLE	As Kurn sits opposite Troi... the others follow to the	table... Worf chooses not to be too close to Kurn.  STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - REV. 1/7/90 - ACT ONE  12.8C   CONTINUED:					TROI			Are you adjusting to your new			environment, Commander?					KURN			I find the constraints quite			difficult to conform to... I'm			sure any Klingon warrior would...	Worf reacts... as Kurn continues, casually --					KURN			... just a short time ago, I had			to stop myself from killing			Commander Riker.	Troi laughs before realizing Kurn is not joking.	During all this, Kurn eats with much gusto and noise	and with his hands... then slowly realizes the others	are waiting for the others to sit before they begin to	eat...					KURN			I believe he was trying to			communicate the crew's discomfort			with my style of command...			under different circumstances,			I would take that as a challenge			to my authority.	Picard now joins them at the table... and everyone	starts to eat with their knifes and fork, quite	daintily... Kurn watches tries awkwardly to imitate...					PICARD			One of the goals of the exchange			program is for all of us to learn			tolerance, Commander. As for my			crew, it may be healthy to shake up			the status quo occasionally. Feel			free to disagree, Mister Riker...	Picard is deliberately displaying a casual example of	starship command by welcoming disagreement...					RIKER			Well, I'd say the commander			certainly has the crew on their			toes...  STAR TREK: "Sins of the Father" - REV. 1/7/90 - ACT ONE  13.8C   CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			... And then some.				(quickly realizing his				 error, to Kurn)			No offense meant, sir...					KURN			None taken. I never kill anyone			at the supper table, Mister La			Forge.	Kurn has struggled the best he can with his dinner,	cannot eat any more...					BEVERLY			Don't you like it, Commander?					KURN				(trying to be tactful)			Our food has much more... taste			to it. While I'm sure this is...			well prepared, it is far too bland			for the stomach of a Klingon...	And the natural glance in the room has to be at Worf	who is enjoying his meal when he hears Kurn say this...					GEORDI			It seems to agree with Worf.					KURN			Yes.	And Worf feels extremely self-conscious, promptly	losing his appetite... and Kurn glances at him out of	the corner of his eye to put a little punctuation into	the moment...9thru	OMITTED1011   INT.
