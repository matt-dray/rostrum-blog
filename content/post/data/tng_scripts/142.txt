SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise as it is traveling at impulse speed.2    INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MAIN ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)	GEORDI is coming down the corridor, he sees a young twenty	five to twenty eight year old ensign -- who has	newly arrived on the Enterprise. She is very	energetic, and enthusiastic in an open and ingenuous	way, which is both appealing and refreshing. Her name	is SONYA. She is standing in front of a food dispenser	panel.					SONYA			Hot chocolate, please.	The hot chocolate appears.					GEORDI			We don't ordinarily say "please"			to food dispensers.					SONYA				(amused)			Since it's listed as "intelligent			Circuitry", why not? After all,			working as much with artificial			intelligence as we do, can be			dehumanizing -- right? So, maybe			we can combat that tendency with			a little simple courtesy.	She removes the cup of hot chocolate.					SONYA				(continuing)			Thank you.	They walk toward Main Engineering.            STAR TREK: "Q Who?"-2/28/89 - TEASER            1A.2    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			For someone who has just arrived,			you certainly aren't shy with your			opinions.					SONYA			Ooops -- have I been talking too			much?					GEORDI			No.           STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 2/24/89 - TEASER           2.2    CONTINUED: (2)					SONYA				(the words come out in				 a rush)			I do tend to be a motor mouth,			especially when I get excited...			and you don't know how exciting			it is to get this assignment.			Everyone in class -- and I mean			everyone -- wants the Enterprise.			I mean, it would have been all			right to spend some time on Ranuos			Six to do phase work with			anti-matter... that's my			speciality.					GEORDI			I know -- that's why you got this			assignment.					SONYA				(off Geordi's smile)			Did it again. It's just that...					GEORDI			I know, you're excited. Sonya.					SONYA			Yes.					GEORDI			I don't think you want to bring			that hot chocolate around these			control stations.					SONYA			Sorry. I shouldn't even have this			in engineering. We were talking			and I just forgot I had it in my			hand...	And as she turns to take it out of the room.					SONYA				(continuing)			I'll finish it over here.				(looks back, and				 seriously)			Lieutenant La Forge, it won't			happen again.	Then as she turns around she crashes right into CAPTAIN	PICARD.           STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 2/24/89 - TEASER           3.2A   PICARD	The cup full of chocolate hits him right in the chest.2B   SCENE	For a moment everyone freezes. Geordi starts forward.					GEORDI			Actually it's my fault, sir...	He looks down at his soiled uniform.					PICARD			Yes, I'm aware of how often you			order picnics to be held in here.	Sonya is about to die from embarassment.					SONYA			Oh no. Oh, Captain... I'm			sorry... oh..				(she tries to brush it				 off)			... I wasn't looking and...				(she pulls her hand				 away)			Oh.. It's all over you.					PICARD			Yes, Ensign. It's all over me.					SONYA			At least let me...	In trying to brush it off, she just makes it worse.	She looks up at Picard, who through it all is	maintaining as much of his dignity as possible.					PICARD			Ensign... ah...					SONYA				(she straightens up to				 her best military				 posture)			Ensign Sonya Gomez.             STAR TREK "Q Who?"-2/28/89 - TEASER             4.2B   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Ensign Gomez is a recent Academy			graduate. She transferred on at			Starbase one seventy three.	Picard's attention is on the widening chocolate stain	that Sonya is creating.					PICARD			Ensign...				(restraining her)			I think it would be simpler if			you let me change my uniform?					GEORDI			Captain, I really have to accept			responsibility for this.	Picard has been looking from one to the other,	beginning to understand what is happening between	Geordi and Sonya.					PICARD			Yes, Chief Engineer. I believe			I do understand now.					SONYA			I'm very excited about this			assignment Captain, and I promise			I'll...				(she looks at the				 chocolate stain on				 Picard's uniform)			... try very hard to serve you and			this ship to the best of my			ability.					PICARD			I'm sure you will. Carry on.            STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 3/2/89 - TEASER            5.2B   CONTINUED: (2)	Picard then turns and strides off.2C   SONYA AND GEORDI					SONYA			First impressions right. Isn't			that what they say -- first			impressions are the most			important.					GEORDI			I'll give you this... it's a			meeting the captain won't soon			forget.					SONYA			What a way to start my first			assignment.	Off Geordi's reaction:3    OMMITTED (3)4    INT. CORRIDOR	Picard walks past a crewman -- who notices the stain on	his uniform, but quickly averts his eyes so as not to	embarrass the captain. Picard turns and enters the	turbolift.4A   INT. TURBOLIFT	The doors close.					PICARD			Deck nine. Officers' quarters.	The turbolift moves off. Then stops. The doors open,	and while still looking down at the stain on his	uniform, Picard steps off.4B   INT. SHUTTLE	Picard is not in a corridor of the Enterprise -- he's on	a shuttle! He turns around and the turbolift doors are	gone.           STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 2/24/89 - TEASER           5A.4C   SCENE	He looks up. There is a crewman at the controls.					PICARD			Crewman? What's going on?	The crewman turns.            STAR TREK: "Q Who?"-2/27/89 - TEASER            6.4D   CREWMAN	It's Q.					Q			There, there, my dear captain.4E   PICARD	Reacts.					PICARD			Q.4F   SCENE (OPTICAL)	Picard moves closer to Q.					Q				(re: the stain)			My, my -- haven't we been careless.	Q passes his hand over the stain on Picard's uniform	and the stain disappears.					Q			There -- a little cleaning service.			I am more than happy to provide.					PICARD			We agreed you would never trouble			my ship again!					Q			I always keep my arrangements,			sir. We are nowhere near your			vessel.	Picard looks out and sees a field of stars. Then back	to Q.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                     STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 3/2/89 - ACT ONE           7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:5    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise moving along at impulse speed.5A   INT. CORRIDOR	Geordi and Sonya are walking to Ten-Forward. She is	in a clean uniform.					GEORDI			I read your graduating thesis.			I wouldn't have requested you if			you weren't the best.	She's uncomfortable with the compliment and shrugs it	off, changes the subject.					SONYA			Where are we going?					GEORDI			To Ten-Forward. We're going to			forget about work. We are going			to sit, talk, relax, look at the			stars. You're going to learn to			slow down.					SONYA				(very intense)			No, that's the one thing I can't			do.					GEORDI				(gently)			You're awfully young to be so			driven.           STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 3/2/89 - ACT ONE           7A.5A   CONTINUED:					SONYA			Yes, I am. I had to be. I had			to be the best because only the			best get to be here. Out here			on the edge.				(gripping his arm and				 giving it a shake)			Geordi, Geordi . . .uh . .				(dropping the arm				 abruptly)			Lieutenant --					GEORDI				(grinning)			Geordi					SONYA			Geordi. Whatever is out here			we're going to be the first			humans ever to see it. And is			it here because we believe in			it and have therefore created			it, or has it created us?					GEORDI			The Grand Unified Theory and			Supersymmetry hasn't been			seriously discussed for years.					SONYA			They also haven't been disproved.			I don't know if it's true or			not, but I've got to try and find			out.					GEORDI			You're more than a scientist			you're a philospher.					SONYA			No, no, I'm not. Oh, God, don't			make me sound profound. There's			just so much out there ... here.	She is gesturing broadly as if somehow she can pull	in and embrace the whole universe.					SONYA				(continuing)			I have to see it all. To			understand it all, and we haven't			got much time.           STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 3/2/89 - ACT ONE           7B.5A   CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			Sonya, it's going to be there for			you. Believe me.				(a beat)			I promise, I won't let anything			exciting slip past without letting			you know.6    INT. TEN-FORWARD	GUINAN is behind the bar. There are a few n.d. crewmembers	scattered around the room. The only one of our	regulars in Ten-Forward is Geordi, who is sitting at	a table by the window with Sonya they are engaged	in a very animated conversation.6A   GUINAN	Something gives her pause -- like a whisper only she	can hear. She is thoughtful for a beat...6B   SCENE	Guinan steps out from behind the bar and crosses to	the center of the room.6C   ANOTHER ANGLE	She stands near Geordi's table for a beat and gazing	out at space. In the background Geordi continues his	conversation with Sonya.					GEORDI (O.S.)			I understand that you're excited			-- so was I. This is your first			assignment, everything is new,			you are eager and that's great,			but...           STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 3/2/89 - ACT ONE           7C.6C   CONTINUED:					SONYA (O.S.)			I've always been an enthusiastic			person, but...	He holds up his hand.					GEORDI (O.S).			Do me a favor... for a minute,			just listen.           STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 2/24/89 - ACT ONE           8.6C   CONTINUED:					SONYA (O.S.)			I always do that. Someone nice			-- and you are nice I can tell,			goes out of their way to give me			some helpful advice... and I'm			so busy talking...	In the b.g. we see Geordi quiet her with a gesture.					SONYA (O.S.)			Not another word. Go ahead...			talk.6D   GUINAN	Her brow knits -- like she has just seen the first	indications of a coming storm. She steps to a	communications panel.					GUINAN			Bridge, this is Ten-Forward.7    INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING RIKER	Who reacts to the unusual call.					RIKER			Guinan?! I don't believe you've			ever called the bridge before.					GUINAN			I've never felt the need. Is			everything alright?					RIKER			How do you mean?					GUINAN			Is there... anything... unusual			happening?					RIKER				(looks around)			Anyone notice anything unusual?				(waits, then)			No Guinan, nothing out of the			ordinary. Why do you ask?          STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 2/24/89 - ACT ONE          8A.7A   ANGLE IN TEN-FORWARD	A thoughtful Guinan responding.           STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 3/1/89 - ACT ONE           9.7A   CONTINUED:					GUINAN			I'm... I'm not certain. Just a			feeling -- something that happened			once before. Probably nothing.				(beat)			Please forget I called. Ten-			Forward out.	She turns and stares out into space.8    OMITTED9    INT. SHUTTLECRAFT	Picard is in the shuttlecraft -- with Q. Picard	adjusts a control; Q smiles.					Q			The locator beacon won't help.			They'll never look for you this			far away.	Picard turns to the com controls.					PICARD			Enterprise -- this is Picard.	There's no response.					PICARD			Stop this foolishness, Q. Return			me to the Enterprise.					Q			I'd suggest you change your			attitude. Petulance does not			become you. We have business.					PICARD			Keeping me a prisoner out here			will not force me to discuss			anything with you.          STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 2/24/89 - ACT ONE          9A.9    CONTINUED:					Q			It will in time, my dear Captain.            STAR TREK "Q Who?"-2/28/89 - ACT ONE            10.10   INT. TEN-FORWARD	Guinan steps up to near the table occupied by Geordi	and Sonya and looks out at the stars.					SONYA			I appreciate your advice,			Lieutenant. And, I'll take it			to heart.	Geordi notices Guinan's distraction.					GEORDI			Guinan?	She turns.					GUINAN			Can I get you something?					GEORDI			No -- we're fine. Is everything			all right?	She looks over at Geordi for a beat then.					GUINAN			I don't know.	But her expression belies the answer. Geordi nods,	but something about her reaction causes him to:					GEORDI				(gets up)			I think I'll go check out			Engineering.					SONYA			I'll go with you.	Guinan watches them leave then turns and once again	looks out at the stars.10A  INT. MAIN BRIDGE	The turbolift doors open and TROI enters. There is	a sense of foreboding in the timing of her arrival.	Reaction from Riker. Troi crosses to her position.          STAR TREK: "Q Who?" - 2/24/89 - ACT ONE          11.10A  CONTINUED:					TROI			Where's the captain?					RIKER			In his Ready Room.	Troi touches a com control.					TROI			Captain -- this is Counselor Troi.	There is no response.11   INT.

We'll find			him. I want to begin a methodical			search. Sensors on maximum scan			We'll use our present location			as the center.

Stardate			(xx). We have not been able to			determine why, or how, Captain			Picard left the Enterprise. We			can't even be certain he is in			the missing shuttle, although that			is the assumption on which we are			proceeding. For the last six			hours we have been searching			without success.16   INT.

SHUTTLE	As before with Picard and Q. Picard attempts to power	up the shuttle. All systems are inoperative.					Q			Do we stay out here years?			Decades? Picard, I am ageless			-- you are not.					PICARD			Then the Enterprise will continue			on with Riker as captain.

TEN-FORWARD	We pull back to reveal Picard and Q, now sitting in Ten-	Forward.					Q			You're right Picard.
