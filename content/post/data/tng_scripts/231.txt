We are			faced with the daunting task of			charting this vast region.2    INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS	RIKER is lying in bed, just starting to wake up. He	lies there a moment, groggy, staring into middle	distance... then finally sits up. Every move is a	struggle. He swings his legs over the bed... rubs his	hands over his face... yawns... he just can't get	going...	He stands up and stretches... slowly crosses the	room...3    ANGLE ON SINK AREA (OPTICAL)	Riker enters and activates the sink. He splashes cold	water onto his face, then looks at his tired face in	the mirror...	And stops, remembering something. He reaches to a	nearby panel and taps a button -- the TIME appears:	it's ten thirty-seven.	Riker reacts, realizing he's late for something. He	rushes to a nearby dressing area and starts to get	ready...           STAR TREK: "Schisms" - 8/14/92 - TEASER           2.4    INT. ENGINEERING	GEORDI and DATA are working at a console; LIEUTENANT	SHIPLEY and VARIOUS ND'S also present. A console	monitor displays a MAP of the AMARGOSA DIASPORA.					GEORDI				(re: map)			Lieutenant Shipley -- let's get			a triangulation on these sector			points... (TECH)					SHIPLEY			Aye sir.	Shipley works. Riker ENTERS, looking harried, like he	just woke up. He crosses to Geordi.					RIKER				(to Geordi)			Sorry I'm late... I overslept			again...				(beat)			What have you got?	Geordi indicates the map.					GEORDI			The cluster's a lot more dense			than we thought. It's going			to take three days just to map			one tenth of it.					RIKER			Three days?					GEORDI			I think we've found a way to speed			this up. We've been testing a			method of channeling warp energy			to the main deflector grid. It			enhances the long-range sensors...					DATA			The modification would increase			our sensor efficiency and imaging			resolution by twenty-five percent			or more.	Riker considers.					RIKER			Sounds like that would take a			lot of warp energy...           STAR TREK: "Schisms" - 8/14/92 - TEASER           3.4    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			We'd channel it through the EPS			mains on Deck Thirteen... near			Cargo Bay Four.	Riker is convinced.					RIKER			It's worth a try.					GEORDI				(to Data)			Data, let's get those subspace			field taps on-line...	Data stands to go... stops by Riker.					DATA				(to Riker)			Commander -- I would like to			remind you about my poetry reading			this afternoon.					RIKER			Wouldn't miss it for the world.	Data EXITS. Riker and Geordi exchange a look...					GEORDI			I can hardly wait to see what he			came up with...	As they work...5    INT. TEN FORWARD	Later. Data is giving his poetry reading to a small	audience, including Riker, Geordi, PICARD, TROI, WORF	and KAMINER (A FEMALE CIVILIAN).        STAR TREK: "Schisms" - REV. 8/17/92 - TEASER        4.5    CONTINUED:	Data sits perched on a stool, reading from a PADD. His	voice is sonorous, measured, his timing utterly	perfect:					DATA				(reading)		"Then we sat on the sand for some time and			observed		How the oceans that cover this world were			perturbed		By the tides from the orbiting moon overhead		'How relaxing the sound of the waves is,' you			said.				(beat)		"I began to expound upon tidal effects		When you told me to stop, looking somewhat			perplexed		So I did not explain why the sunset turned red		And we watched the occurrence in silence			instead."	There is APPLAUSE from the audience. Data acknowledges	the crowd. Riker lets out a huge yawn. Troi throws	him a look.					RIKER				(softly, to Troi)			I don't understand this... I can			barely keep my eyes open...					DATA				(to audience)			That poem was written in anapestic			tetrameter. For my ninth poem,			we move to the iambic septameter			mode.				(beat)			Throughout the ages, from Keats			to Jorkemo, poets have composed			odes to the individuals who have			had a profound effect on their			lives. In keeping with that			tradition, I have written my next			poem in honor of my cat. I call			it "Ode to Spot."	Data looks at the page, takes in a breath...          STAR TREK: "Schisms" - 8/14/92 - TEASER          4A.5    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA				(reading)		"Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature		An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature		Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses		Contribute to your hunting skill and natural			defenses."	It is evident from the audience's responses that Data	has been reading for a long while -- too long. People	are starting to shift uncomfortably. Riker looks like	he might fall asleep at any moment. While Data's	poetry is technically flawless, it is also dry and	tedious, without passion.					DATA				(continuing)		"I find myself intrigued by your sub-vocal			oscillations		A singular development of cat communication		That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection		For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate			affection... "           STAR TREK: "Schisms" - 8/14/92 - TEASER           5.5    CONTINUED: (3)	People try to look enthused as Data reads... but it's	difficult. Many are fighting boredom. Geordi and Worf	exchange a look... Picard crosses and uncrosses his	legs... Riker is struggling to stay awake -- he can	barely keep his eyes focused... he shifts in his seat,	stifles a yawn...					DATA				(continuing)		"A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic			talents		You would not be so agile if you lacked its			counterbalance		And when not being utilized to aid in locomotion		It often serves to illustrate the state of your			emotions."	Suddenly, from somewhere in the audience, a SNORE is	heard.6    ON RIKER	who has fallen asleep. Troi nudges him. He wakes with	a start, disoriented, and automatically starts to	applaud. Data stops reading. People look over. Riker	realizes what's happened...					DATA				(to Riker)			You have prematurely anticipated			my denouement, Commander.			However, I appreciate the			sentiment.				(beat)			I will continue.	Data continues to read.					DATA		"Oh Spot, the complex level of behavior you display		Connotes a fairly well-developed cognitive array		And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not			comprehend		I nonetheless consider you a true and valued			friend... "	Over this, Troi throws a look at Riker, who is	disturbed by his overwhelming fatigue. OFF his face,	as he stifles another yawn, wondering how he could be	so exhausted...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                    STAR TREK: "Schisms" - 8/14/92 - ACT ONE          6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	(NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)7    INT. SICKBAY	Riker sitting on an examination table, looking	fatigued. Beverly scans him with a medical tricorder.					RIKER			I don't have any problem getting			to sleep... and I think I'm			sleeping all night... but when			I wake up, I feel exhausted...					BEVERLY			How long has this been going on?					RIKER			The last two, three nights...	Riker eyes the tricorder, growing agitated as Beverly	waves it near his head.					RIKER				(re: tricorder)			Do you have to hold that thing			so close?	Beverly moves the tricorder away, surprised by the	remark. Riker relaxes a little.					RIKER			I'm sorry... I've been on edge			all day.	Beverly completes her scan.					BEVERLY			Other than some muscle tension			in your neck, I don't see anything			wrong with you physically...				(beat)			Have you been having bad dreams?	Riker thinks, rubs his sore neck.					RIKER			Not that I can remember...          STAR TREK: "Schisms" - 8/14/92 - ACT ONE          7.7    CONTINUED:	Beverly considers.					BEVERLY			This may be the result of a lack			of REM sleep...					RIKER			What do you recommend?	Beverly picks up a PADD, taps something into it --	hands the PADD to Riker.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			Drink this before you go to bed.					RIKER				(re: PADD)			What is it?					BEVERLY			A recipe for a warm milk toddy.					RIKER				(playful)			Warm milk toddy... you're kidding.					BEVERLY				(right back at him)			The heat activates amino acids			in the lactose -- which acts as			a natural sedative.				(beat)			Besides, this is a recipe of the			Captain's Aunt Adelle. It's			delicious.	Riker stands to go.					RIKER			At this point, I'll give anything			a try.				(beat)			Thanks.	Beverly smiles.

Geordi looks excited	by their work -- this is an important moment for him.					GEORDI				(off console)			Everything's in place... deflector			grid couplers... subspace field			taps...				(beat)			Let's do it. Lieutenant Shipley			-- initiate warp power transfer...					SHIPLEY			Aye sir...				(works)			Sensor array on-line...	Geordi watches the console closely, eager for this to	work.					GEORDI			Come on... work...	Data monitors his console for a moment.					DATA				(to Geordi)			Geordi -- active scanner output			has increased by twenty-six			percent.	Geordi is pleased -- he turns to Shipley.					GEORDI				(to Shipley)			Inform Astrophysics that the new			La Forge sensor array is on-line			and awaiting major scientific			discoveries.					SHIPLEY			Yes sir.          STAR TREK: "Schisms" - 8/14/92 - ACT ONE          9.8    CONTINUED:	Shipley EXITS. Geordi moves to a console. A beat as	they work. Data turns to Geordi, curious.					DATA			Geordi... may I make a personal			inquiry? It concerns my poetry			reading.	Geordi looks uncomfortable at the mention of it...	keeps working...					GEORDI			Sure, Data... what is it?					DATA			I noticed that many spectators			seemed distracted during my			presentation. Was my poetry			uninteresting?	Geordi hesitates, awkward.					GEORDI			Well... it was very well			constructed... a real tribute			to form...				(beat)			I especially liked your Haiku			poem...	Data looks puzzled.					DATA			My Haiku was only three lines			long.					GEORDI			Yeah... it was great... very...			brisk...					DATA			Brisk...				(beat)			Geordi, are you saying that the			shorter my poems, the better?					GEORDI			No... well... sort of...				(beat)			To be honest, Data... some of your			longer poems were a little dry.	Data considers.       STAR TREK: "Schisms" - REV. 8/17/92 - ACT ONE       9A.8    CONTINUED: (2)	Geordi comes clean.					GEORDI			Maybe some of your poems were a			little... formal.	Data considers.					DATA			I have found poetry more			challenging than other artistic			endeavors. Unlike painting and			musical composition, it demands			a more articulated emotional			content.					GEORDI			Next time, don't worry so much			about rhyme and meter. Some of the			world's greatests poets didn't pay			attention to rules...	Suddenly, a warning ALARM goes off. Geordi reacts,	looks toward the large wall DISPLAY of the Enterprise.	A section of the ship is FLASHING.          STAR TREK: "Schisms" - 8/14/92 - ACT ONE          10.8    CONTINUED: (3)					GEORDI				(re: alarm)			That's the power grid warning...	They quickly move to the wall display, study it.					DATA				(off display)			I am reading a massive EPS			explosion.					GEORDI			Where?					DATA			I am attempting to localize it...				(works)			It is Cargo Bay Four.					GEORDI				(reacts)			I've got three people down there!				(taps communicator)			Damage control, medical team, to			Cargo Bay Four!				(to Data)			Let's go...	As Geordi and Data run out...9    INT. CORRIDOR	ON THE MOVE with Worf and ONE SECURITY N.D. running	along, emergency gear in-tow. They converge outside	the CARGO BAY FOUR doors, where Geordi, Data and	Shipley are already taking tricorder scans. Beverly	and TWO MEDICAL N.D.s arrive a second later, with a	gurney and various medical gear.					DATA				(off tricorder)			The field imbalance has subsided.			I believe it is safe to enter.          STAR TREK: "Schisms" - 8/14/92 - ACT ONE          11.9    CONTINUED:	Worf motions for everyone to move aside.					WORF				(to all)			There may still be a residual			discharge. Stand clear.	Worf and the security N.D.'s position themselves on	either side of the door, emergency gear at-the-ready.	Once they're in place, Worf works the control panel on	the wall and the doors OPEN...	A beat as nothing happens. Then Worf nods and the	security team quickly enters the bay...10   INT. CARGO BAY	Continuous. Worf and the security N.D.'s rush in --	and stop at what they see. Geordi and the others	quickly follow, and also react to the sight --11   ANGLE ON CARGO BAY	The THREE CREWMEMBERS are carrying a piece of	equipment, stopped in mid-stride, staring back at Worf	and the others with looks of utter surprise. They are	unharmed. The Cargo Bay is undamaged. There has been	no explosion.
