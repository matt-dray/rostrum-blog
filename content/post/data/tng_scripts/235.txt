RIKER'S QUARTERS	Riker, Beverly, Geordi and Worf at the poker table.	Beverly is shuffling. Geordi notices that Worf is	looking at him peculiarly.					WORF			Commander... is it your intention			to continue growing your beard?					GEORDI			I'm not sure, Worf. Why?					WORF			I am just asking.					BEVERLY			Seven-card stud, one-eyed jacks			are wild. Frankly, I like your			beard, Geordi.					GEORDI			Thanks, Doctor.	She has finished dealing, and inspects the table.					BEVERLY			The king is high... your bet, Wil.	The players contribute chips during the next.					BEVERLY			Of course, I'm always a little			suspicious of men with beards.	In that she's sitting at a table with three bearded	men, this brings a reaction.					WORF			For what reason?					BEVERLY			I don't know... it's as though			they're trying to hide something.   STAR TREK: "The Quality... " - REV. 10/02/92 - TEASER   1A.A1	CONTINUED:					RIKER			Hide -- ? Doctor, that's			ridiculous. Beards are a proud			and ancient tradition.					GEORDI			Some of the most esteemed men in			history had beards.					BEVERLY			I know... but after the razor was			invented... I think beards became			mostly a fashion statement.	She deals the next round.					WORF			I am not concerned with fashion.			To a Klingon, a beard is a symbol			of courage.					RIKER			I think it suggests a certain...			strength.					BEVERLY			Sure. After all, women can't grow			one.					GEORDI			Doctor, I get the feeling you			think beards are nothing more than			an affectation.					BEVERLY			I do. I'm not saying there's			anything wrong with that... women			wear makeup and nail polish for			the same reason.				(beat)			I just think you men should admit			it.					RIKER			My beard isn't an affectation.					BEVERLY			Oh? Then why not shave it off?					RIKER			I could lose it in a minute.				(beat)			I've just gotten used to it.   STAR TREK: "The Quality... " - REV. 10/06/92 - TEASER   1B.A1	CONTINUED: (2)	Beverly glances around at all of them, then at her	hand.					BEVERLY			Okay... what do you say we up the			stakes a little? If I win this			hand... you all shave off your			beards.					GEORDI			What if one of us wins? What do			you give up?					BEVERLY				(shrugs)			I'm open to suggestions...					RIKER			I've always wondered what you'd			look like as a brunette...					BEVERLY			I tried it once when I was			thirteen. I couldn't wait to			change it back.					RIKER			That makes me even more curious...	She gives him a look... so it's going to be like this,	is it? She glances down at her cards... obviously	feels very confident.					BEVERLY			Fine. If one of you wins -- I			become a brunette. Are we on?	There's a hesitation... they look at their cards...	then at each other, hoping someone has a good hand.					GEORDI			We'll take that bet.	Worf glares at him... he'd better have a good hand.					RIKER				(are you sure?)			Geordi...					BEVERLY			Sounds like you have the hand to			beat, Commander.				(MORE)   STAR TREK: "The Quality...

She puts in the	chips.					BEVERLY			Call.	All eyes turn to Geordi... he looks at his cards...	takes a breath... starts to put them down...					PICARD'S COM VOICE			This is the Captain. We have			arrived at the Tyran system. All			senior staff to the Bridge.	Geordi immediately throws down his cards, face down,	as do the others, making an indiscriminate pile. They	rise.   STAR TREK: "The Quality... " - REV. 10/02/92 - TEASER   1C.A1	CONTINUED: (3)					BEVERLY			Wait --					RIKER			Sorry, Doctor, you heard the			Captain. Duty calls.	He smiles sweetly as they head for the door.					RIKER			I'm sure we can try this another			time.	They all hurry out as Beverly stares after them,	frustrated.1    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship is in orbit around the fiery, red moon of a	planet. A small SPACE STATION also orbits the moon,	and a glowing blue PILLAR OF ENERGY extends from the	station down to the surface of the moon.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log, stardate 46307.2.			We have just come into orbit of			Tyrus-Seven-A to monitor progress			on the Tyran particle fountain,			a radically new mining technology.2    INT. STATION CORE (OPTICAL)	The station core is unfinished, with equipment consoles	scattered about. In several places, the walls are cut	through with holes which lead away to access tunnels	deep within the station. A Transporter pad and console	are in one corner. In the center of the floor is a	large, glowing circular core (similar to the	Enterprise's warp core).	Several NDs are working in the b.g. The atmosphere	should be that of a large-scale construction project:	constant activity in the b.g., problems with equipment,	and the tension of working under a deadline.					PICARD (V.O.)			So far the project has been			fraught with problems, and is well			behind schedule. Mister La Forge			has been assigned to evaluate the			situation.   STAR TREK: "The Quality... " - REV. 10/02/92 - TEASER   1D.2    CONTINUED:	GEORDI is standing with the project leader, DOCTOR	FARALLON. She's an attractive humanoid alien woman	about the same age as Geordi. They're discussing an	Okudagram of the particle fountain displayed on a wall	monitor. From the tone of Geordi's voice, it's clear	this isn't the first disagreement they've had.     STAR TREK: "The Quality of Life" - 9/28/92 - TEASER     2.2    CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(patiently)			Doctor Farallon. The original			design called for the particle			fountain to lift five-hundred			kilograms per minute from the			surface -- so far it hasn't come			close to that.					FARALLON			That's why I want to increase the			stream density -- that should			boost the lift capacity by			seventy-two percent.					GEORDI			Yeah... and overload the field			generators in the process.					FARALLON				(shakes her head)			Not if we distribute the overload			evenly throughout the system.	Geordi regards her... an eager, ambitious young	woman... bright and dedicated, but a little strung out	right now with fatigue and the pressure of this	difficult project.					GEORDI			Doctor... forgive me... but maybe			we should concentrate on getting			this phase of the project			completed... before we start			talking about re-designing it...	Farallon stares at him... wilts a little.					FARALLON			Commander... I know you're here			to evaluate this project...					GEORDI				(acknowledging)			Starfleet is considering whether			to use a particle fountain on			Carema Three... they want to know			how feasible it is.					FARALLON			And will your opinion be the			deciding factor?    STAR TREK: "The Quality... " - REV. 9/30/92 - TEASER    3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			Not really... I'll make my report			to Captain Picard... he'll make			the official recommendation to			Starfleet... and they'll decide.					FARALLON			Well. What's your feeling so far?					GEORDI			I guess the question we have to			ask... is if this technology is			any more efficient than			conventional mining techniques.	Farallon eyes him... and speaks with the utter	conviction of someone who is dedicated to her cause.					FARALLON			Commander... I know we've had			problems here. It seems like			nothing's gone right... it's			taking a lot longer than I thought			to get the particle stream to full			strength.				(beat)			But I know it can work. This			is the direction mining will take			in the future... and it should			be implemented on Carema Three.					GEORDI			I agree that potentially it's very			exciting...					FARALLON			I want to show you something I've			been working on... something that			might help us complete this			project more quickly.	She moves toward an equipment locker.					FARALLON			I've used these on a limited			basis... I think they've earned			a try...	Suddenly, the LIGHTS DIM and the STATION TREMBLES.	ALARM KLAXONS begin to sound. Geordi and Farallon rush	over to check the readout on a wall panel. They	exchange a concerned look.    STAR TREK: "The Quality of Life" - 9/28/92 - TEASER    3A.3    INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE	DATA sits at the Aft Science station, studying the	monitor with concern. WORF is at Tactical.					DATA			Enterprise to Commander La Forge.			I am reading significant power			fluctuations from the station			core. Please report.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			La Forge here... there's been a			malfunction in one of the power			grids...4    INT. STATION CORE	Lots of ND activity in the b.g. as Geordi and Farallon	work a pair of consoles.					GEORDI				(to COM)			... we're losing particle stream			confinement.     STAR TREK: "The Quality of Life" - 9/28/92 - TEASER     4.4    CONTINUED:					DATA'S COM VOICE			Do you require assistance?					GEORDI			Stand by.	Geordi turns to Farallon. He knows she isn't going to	like this, but the situation does not look good.					GEORDI			I think we're going to have to			shut it down.					FARALLON			It took four months to get the			particle flux up to this level.			If we shut down, it'll take			another four months just to get			it back.					GEORDI			We have less than five minutes			before we lose confinement. When			that happens, the particle stream			will flood the entire station,			and then we'll have to shut it			down anyway.					FARALLON			Then we'll just have to fix the			power grid.					GEORDI			How do we do that?				(gesturing to a console)			The defective grid is two hundred			meters down conduit A-Four. We'd			have to disassemble four			bulkheads to get to it...					FARALLON			Well... here's the perfect			opportunity to show you what I			had in mind...	Geordi looks puzzled as she goes to the equipment	locker, opens it, and takes out --    STAR TREK: "The Quality...

(Note: the exocomp should be	small enough to be carried easily by one person.)8    RESUME SCENE	She takes a CONTROL PADD out of the locker. She moves	quickly to an access tunnel hole and places the	exocomp in front of it.					GEORDI			What is it?					FARALLON			This is an exocomp -- the			experiment I was telling you			about...	She quickly taps several commands into the PADD; the	panel on the exocomp flashes in response. (Note: a	subtle sound effect should indicate the exocomp in	operation.) She hits a final key on the control PADD.    STAR TREK: "The Quality...

Then, the	exocomp RISES INTO THE AIR, and moves into the tunnel.10   RESUME SCENE					FARALLON			If it doesn't work, we'll still			have time to shut down the			fountain...10A  INT.

STATION CORE	Farallon and Geordi stand at the access tunnel,	waiting.					GEORDI			If this doesn't work pretty soon,			I recommend you shut down...	Farallon doesn't answer, just stares down the access	tunnel. Then suddenly, the station LIGHTS COME BACK UP	and the flashing ALARM LIGHTS TURN OFF.					GEORDI				(off console)			The confinement field is at full			strength... particle flux			steady... all power levels normal.     STAR TREK: "The Quality of Life" - 9/28/92 - TEASER     7.10B  CONTINUED:	Geordi looks at Farallon, amazed.
