TEN FORWARD/HOLODECK (OPTICAL)	Lieutenant ENDICOTT REGINALD BARCLAY THE THIRD slouches	at the bar. Scattered around the room are HOLO-TROI,	who sits provocatively at a table in her off the	shoulder dress; HOLO-RIKER seated at the end of the bar	and mumbling into his drink, OTHERS. There should be	the suggestion of something bogus about the scene, like	a bad John Wayne movie, rife with cliches and	over-acting. Holo-Guinan walks over to Barclay...	with a bottle of whisky and a shot glass.					HOLO-GUINAN			I don't want any trouble,			Barlcay...					BARCLAY			Trouble? Why would there be			trouble?					HOLO-GUINAN			There's always trouble when you			come in here.	Barclay just grins. As he opens the bottle and pours	a shot... HOLO-GEORDI ENTERS, comes up behind Barclay.					HOLO-GEORDI			You're on duty, Lieutenant.					BARCLAY			Is that a fact?					HOLO-GEORDI			It is, and you'll observe it.			Get back to your post.					BARCLAY			Look, pal. Do me a favor. Take			yourself and your holier-than-thou			attitude and get out of my life.	During the above, Holo-Riker looks up from his position	at the bar, stands, moves over.    STAR TREK: "Hollow Pursuits" - REV. 2/14/90 - TEASER    1A.1    CONTINUED:					HOLO-RIKER			This is insubordination, Mister			Barclay.					BARCLAY			So punish me.					HOLO-RIKER				(keys insignia)			Security to Ten-Forward!	A SECURITY CREWMAN ENTERS and heads for Barclay. In	a blur of a movement, Barclay manages to flip him	neatly onto the floor. All stare at him, stunned.    STAR TREK: "Hollow Pursuits" - REV. 2/13/90 - TEASER    2.1    CONTINUED:	The Holo-Guard groans, Barclay smirks, takes a gulp of	synthehol and gestures with the glass at Holo-Riker.					BARCLAY			"Insubordination."	Holo-Riker seizes his arm and slops the drink; Barclay	turns quickly, gets a half-Nelson on Holo-Riker and	strains him painfully against the counter.					BARCLAY			Riker, you're nothing but a pretty			mannequin dressed up in a fancy			uniform. You're full of hot air,			and if Picard has a problem with			me, he can come and tell me			himself...	Barclay gives him one last hard push before releasing	him. Defeated, Holo-Riker slips wearily down and leans	against the bar. Barclay moves threateningly at	Holo-Geordi, who retreats, runs out of the room, scared	to death. Barclay saunters over to the table where	Holo-Troi is seated. He picks up her willing hand.					HOLO-TROI			I feel your confidence, your			arrogant resolve. It excites me.	COM VOICE OF THE REAL GEORDI --					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Lieutenant Barclay, report to			Cargo Bay Five now.					BARCLAY				(to Troi)			This will have to wait, darling.				(to com)			Um... Be right there.				(to the room)			Freeze program. Exit.	All the human figures FREEZE. Barclay heads toward	the o.s. Holodeck doors.					BARCLAY			Save program.	Ten Forward vanishes... he EXITS.    STAR TREK: "Hollow Pursuits" - REV. 2/13/90 - TEASER    3.2    INT. CORRIDOR	Barclay steps into the corridor, a much altered man.	The hero of the hour has been replaced with a shy	individual with a perpetual frown born of stress and	unhappiness between his brows. He is hustling because	he's late. Troi comes briskly around a corner. She's	headed straight for him. He steps aside for her. Troi	nods in greeting, gives him a kindly but perfunctory	smile and moves on. We barely notice Barclay sigh as	he moves on.3    INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)	O'BRIEN is operating the transporter console... several	canisters MATERIALIZE. A couple of ENGINEERING	TECHNICIANS (named DUFFY and COSTA) move the canisters	from the transporter pad to an antigrav unit. Geordi	is studying an open panel on the unit which is out of	service... Riker is listening to him gripe about	Barclay.					GEORDI			I just don't know what to do with			him. He's always late, never			gives his best effort, always			slides by... I can't deal with			it anymore. How does a guy like			him ever make it through the			Academy...					RIKER				(agrees)			I think it's time we talked to			the captain about Broccoli.				(off Geordi's look)			That's what Wesley calls him.			Keep it to yourself.					GEORDI			It fits.3A   ANGLE	as they see Barclay ENTER... moving to him... a	throw-away piece of business -- Duffy discovers a	canister with a trace of GASEOUS NITROGEN leaking from	it.					DUFFY			A broken seal, Commander.    STAR TREK: "Hollow Pursuits" - REV. 2/14/90 - TEASER    3A.3A   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			You better destroy it. Those			samples will be tainted.	Duffy and the other supernumerary take the canister	away. Barclay tries to slither past Riker and Geordi.	What we notice most about him is that he is	uncomfortable around other people to the point of	agony... he rarely makes eye contact... when he	speaks, he hesitates, desperately afraid of saying the	wrong thing... which he occasionally does.					GEORDI			Is it a problem for you to report			to duty on time, Lieutenant?    STAR TREK: "Hollow Pursuits" - REV. 2/19/90 - TEASER    4.3A   CONTINUED: (2)					BARCLAY			Problem? Nossir. I'm... I'm very			sorry, sir... it's just... I had			a very important communique...			it required my immediate response			and...					GEORDI				(tired of excuses)			I don't want to hear it... we're			having intermittent problems with			the anti-grav unit, see what you			can do...	Barclay acknowledges and as he moves to the unit...					RIKER			Mister Barclay, I'm tired of			seeing your name on report.				(a beat)			I don't know what you got away			with on your last posting, but			this is the Enterprise. We set			a different standard here.			Understood?	And for a beat, Barclay looks at Riker and it is quite	a different moment than the Holodeck.					BARCLAY			Understood... sir.	Riker exchanges a glance with Geordi then EXITS as	Barclay meekly goes to work...									FADE OUT.                       END OF THE TEASER                            STAR TREK: "Hollow Pursuits" - REV. 2/13/90 - ACT ONE    5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:4    EXT.

The samples could prove			vital to the containment of an			outbreak of Correllium Fever on			that world.5    INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)	Barclay closes up the anti-grav panels, looks up at	Geordi...					BARCLAY				(shrugs)			Everything looks... it looks			normal to me...	He turns it on and the antigrav unit comes to life...	rises a few feet off the floor. Duffy starts to move	the unit toward the other end of the cargo bay. Almost	immediately, the antigrav field fails and there is a	CRASH as the pallet falls.					O'BRIEN			Dammit..	Barclay reacts, Geordi turns, looks at him	impatiently...					BARCLAY			I... I don't understand...	Barclay looks guilty, tongue-tied... rushes back to	the anti-grav unit to check it out again.    STAR TREK: "Hollow Pursuits" - REV. 2/16/90 - ACT ONE    6.5A   ANGLE					GEORDI				(to com)			La Forge to Engineering... I'll			need more people in Cargo Bay			Five... anyone you can spare.			Out.	He moves to the anti-grav unit, begins to lift a	canister... Geordi looks at Barclay who is still	trying to solve the mystery in the anti-grav unit	panel...					GEORDI			We could use a hand, Mister			Barclay...	Barclay looks up awkwardly at Geordi... moves quickly	to help... and as he takes hold of the canister,	facing Geordi...					BARCLAY			I'll... I'll disassemble it later,			Commander... it shouldn't do			that... well, of course, it			shouldn't do that... I mean...			well, it shouldn't do that.	Two beats as they carry the canister in silence across	the room... Barclay avoids Geordi's glare.6    INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM	Picard behind his desk. Riker and Geordi. There is	a report on the computer screen on Picard's desk.	Picard indicates the screen.    STAR TREK: "Hollow Pursuits" - REV. 2/14/90 - ACT ONE    7.6    CONTINUED:					PICARD			I'm not accustomed to seeing an			unsatisfactory rating for one of			my crew.					RIKER			I guess the issue is whether			Mister Barclay is Enterprise			material.					PICARD				(to Geordi)			I assume from your request for			his transfer that you don't think			he is, Commander...	Geordi takes a beat -- he's aware of the impact of this	answer...					GEORDI			I hate to say it... I always			thought I could work with			anyone... but I just can't stand			the guy. Broccoli makes me			nervous... he makes everyone			nervous...					PICARD			Broccoli?					RIKER			Young Mister Crusher started it.			I'm afraid it's caught on.					PICARD			Let's get it uncaught, shall we?	They acknowledge.					PICARD			By all indications, Barclay has			served honorably in Starfleet for			many years.

Too easy.					GEORDI			Captain, it's not like I haven't			tried...					PICARD			Try harder.	The captain studies La Forge... there is an issue of	command to be examined here...					PICARD			He's on your team. Manage him.			Pull him in. Find ways to help			him make a positive contribution.			Get to know the man. Make him			your best friend.	Geordi smiles with a bit of incredulity...					GEORDI			With all respect, sir... my best			friend? I can barely tolerate			being in the same room with the			man...					PICARD			I suggest you put your personal			discomfort with him aside,			Commander.

CARGO BAY	Geordi ENTERS... the room is deserted now except for	Barclay who is off to one side looking over the	disassembled antigrav unit. It's open, the guts	exposed as he traces circuits with a sensor. Geordi	frowns to himself as he looks over to Barclay, whose	back is to him.					GEORDI				(muttering, to himself)			My best friend.	He sighs, knows what he has to do, crosses to...6B   ANGLE - BARCLAY	wrapped up in his mystery... Geordi moves up behind	him, and as he pats him on the back...					GEORDI			Hey, Reg...	And Barclay nearly jumps out of his shoes at the	unexpected physical contact... Geordi reacts, covers...					GEORDI			Uh, how's it going?					BARCLAY			Oh, it's... I still haven't traced			the problem, Commander...					GEORDI				(smile, "warm")			That's okay. No rush. Take your			time.	Barclay notes this new tone of voice from Geordi...	glances at him suspiciously... a beat. Doesn't trust	the moment... rushes to fill the gap...					BARCLAY			I've... I've been planning to run			diagnostics on the graviton			invertor circuits...    STAR TREK: "Hollow Pursuits" - REV. 2/9/90 - ACT ONE    10.6B   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Smart plan... well, I'd say we're			in good hands here...					BARCLAY				(still suspicious)			I'll get a preliminary report to			you...					GEORDI			...whenever.					BARCLAY				(beat)			Before the end of the day.					GEORDI			Fine. And say, Reg, how about			sitting in on the mission briefing			with my senior officers in the			morning...					BARCLAY			The briefing? Me?					GEORDI			I'd just like your input...					BARCLAY			On what? I mean, should I prepare			something...					GEORDI			No... no... just be there. Eight			hundred hours.					BARCLAY			I'll be on time, sir.					GEORDI			Good.	And he's about to pat Barclay on the back once more,	thinks better of it... as he turns to leave, an	exasperated expression fills his face... and Barclay	sighs, glad this is over.6C   EXT.

Start your brains, and			let's do it.	They all gather around the pool table for the morning	briefing. After a beat, Barclay rushes in late, out of	breath... Geordi nods to him.					GEORDI				(points to injectors				 on schematic)			Okay, this trip to Nahmi Four is			pretty routine. We'll have plenty			of time to realign the magnetic			capacitors in both the matter and			anti-matter injectors.				(light hearted groans)			Duffy, Costa, that'll be your			assignment.					DUFFY			We probably ought to do the flow			regulator maintenance at the same			time, Commander.					GEORDI			Good idea.				(moving on)			Ensign Crusher is putting in some			hours with us this week as part			of his training duties... he'll			be assigned to assist you, Mister			Myers. Be sure and teach him the			difference between impulse and			warp drive.				(chuckles all around)			Lieutenant Barclay is working on			the mystery of the anti-grav			failure we had yesterday... your			preliminary report had a couple			of interesting theories, Reg...	Geordi waits a beat for Barclay to pick it up and run	with it. He doesn't. After an awkward beat...   STAR TREK: "Hollow Pursuits" - REV. 2/19/90 - ACT ONE   12.7    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Why don't you summarize your			findings so far, Reg...	As Barclay begins to answer, we can see him growing	more and more uncomfortable under the gaze of his	fellow engineers.					BARCLAY			Yes.				(clears his throat)			It wasn't a maintenance problem...			everything checked out. I...			I'm going to check for... a surge			in... the transfer coils.					WESLEY				(certain)			A coil surge wouldn't have			resulted in a field dissipation.	Attention now focuses on Wesley.
