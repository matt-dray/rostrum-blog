SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it moves through space at impulse speed					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 42502.7.			We are traveling in the Omega			Twelve System traversing between			a clustering of small planets that			form the coalition of Madena VI.2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	We see the complement of people who normally make up	the bridge crew. DATA and WESLEY at the front consoles	controlling CONN and OPS. RIKER sits on one side of	PICARD at the Command Area, the opposite seat empty,	WORF stands near the Science Stations which are manned	by n.d. crewmembers.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			Each of these planets is populated			by separate humanoid people who			co-exist and trade technology and			minerals under a precarious but			successful treaty.3    AFT STATIONS - MISSION CONTROL PANEL	An ALERT SIGNAL FLASHES on the screen. The science	crewmember looks up to Worf who steps to the panel,	checks it and then announces.					WORF			We have an unidentified vessel			approaching.					RIKER			Give me grid markers.    STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - TEASER    2.3    CONTINUED:					WORF			Sector three-nine-five-six,			mark zero-nine-one.	The personnel on the bridge show little emotion but	you can sense a little stiffening of their posture,	a glint of expectation in Worf's eyes. Picard sits	coolly and observes his well-tuned crew handling the	situation.4    ANGLE ON SCIENCE SCREEN - INTERCUTS AS NEEDED	Lines start to form the three dimensions blueprint of	a space vehicle, at first very sparse and then filling	quickly as more information runs through the computers	and information bands run across the lower portion of	the screen.					DATA			Sensor readings place overall			dimension of vehicle an			interplanetary cargo ship.					WORF			One life sign on board, appears			to be humanoid.	In the b.g. we see TROI exit the turbolift and take	her place quietly beside Picard.					DATA			A vessel of that size usually			maintains a crew of six.					WORF			Minimum armament present.					DATA			Sensors show cargo holds are			empty.					WORF			The course is inconsistent with			normal cargo routes.					RIKER			This could be a primitive method			to elude detection.    STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - TEASER    3.5    SCIENCE SCREEN	The three-dimensional schematic slowly revolves around	the screen showing all angles of the unidentified	craft. An alert RED DOT BLINKS on the interior of part	of the live blueprint and a band of continuing detail	specifications rolls across the lower portion of the	screen.					DATA			Readout shows a burnout in			inertial guidance system...					RIKER			The pilot is attempting to hold			his vessel in check manually.					WORF			That could be a pretense.6    ON PICARD	He speaks calmly.					PICARD			Captain's log, supplemental. We			have just encountered and			identified an interplanetary cargo			vessel which is apparently in need			of emergency assistance. We will			make every effort to do so.				(beat)			Open hailing frequencies.					WORF			Hailing frequencies open.					PICARD			This is the USS Enterprise.			Captain Jean-Luc Picard, over.	A pleasant male voice with the touch of laughter and	humor in it comes over the speakers.					OKONA'S COM VOICE			And this is the cargo ship			Erstwhile "limping" and "skidding"			off course. Captain Okona at your			service. As you see, there is			no need for phasers, Captain.			I'm harmless and not quite ready			yet for mercy killing.    STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - TEASER    4.6    CONTINUED:					PICARD			You were never considered a danger			to us, Captain Okona.					OKONA'S COM VOICE			It's a shame. I can remember when			I was at least considered a			"risk."	There is a moment of silence, then the sound of Okona's	laughter, which builds and becomes infectious. At	first it puzzles the Enterprise crew, then the laughter	catches hold and slight smiles begin to break the	tension.					WORF			The ship is in viewer range now,			Captain.					PICARD			Main Viewer on.7    ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	We now see the image of the man, his face slightly	turned from the screen and not clearly showing. His	joviality continues, and although more subdued, seems	to be just as contagious.					OKONA			I'm the owner and operator of this			craft and since we both know you			scanned my vessel, you know I'm			alone and empty...				(smile)			... and it's truly a rare occasion			for a man of my charm, beauty and			talent.	Okona mocks his own arrogance with his spontaneous	laughter. His humorous jab at himself takes the bite	off the remark.8    CLOSER ON MAIN VIEWER - OKONA (OPTICAL)	Turns his smile full face to the Main Viewer. He has	the look of a hero, the twinkle in the steely blue eyes	softening the rugged handsomeness of the man.       STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - TEASER    5.8    CONTINUED:					OKONA			But then with the condition of			this vessel I'm glad I have no			responsibilities except for myself			till I can get some repairs.9    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard turns to Troi.					PICARD			Counselor, can you read him?					TROI			His emotions suggest that he is			mischievous, irreverent and			somewhat brazen.				(beat)			And some other things...				(unsure)			The word that seems to describe			him best is "rogue."					DATA			Rogue? Accessing "rogue."				(kicks in)			Cad, knave, rake, rascal,			scoundrel, villain.					TROI			Yes, all of that, but he shows			no malevolence, or ill will.	Picard turns back to the viewscreen.					PICARD			What form of assistance can we			offer you, Captain?					OKONA			I had a burnout on my guidance			system. I'd appreciate it if I			could use your facilities to			repair it.					WESLEY			It would be possible.					PICARD			Estimate, Mister Data.    STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - TEASER    6.9    CONTINUED:					DATA			Time for repair would be seven			hours sixteen minutes.					RIKER			Okona will have to shut down while			we verify specifications.	Picard holds a few beats, then issues his orders.					PICARD			Lieutenant Worf, prepare security			procedures.				(to Okona)			We can accommodate you.					WORF			I'll allow him limited access.					RIKER			If you'll prepare to shut down			your engines we'll lock on			tractors and beam you aboard.					OKONA			Many thanks, Captain Picard.					RIKER			Transporter Chief, prepare to beam			aboard from Tractor lock bearing.	The well-modulated female voice of the TRANSPORTER	CHIEF, B.G. ROBINSON, answers.					B.G. ROBINSON'S COM VOICE			Yes Number One, at your command.					OKONA			Is that a woman's voice I hear?					PICARD			Yes. Now please follow the			directions of Commander Riker so			our ship can get back to its			normal routine.	Riker smiles as he moves away. Picard notices.					PICARD				(continuing)			Something funny, Commander Riker.    STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - TEASER    7.9    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			The unexpected, like what's			happening now, IS our normal			routine.	Picard muses for a beat, a slight nod shows his	agreement.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE    8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:10   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE / THE ERSTWHILE (OPTICAL)	As the Erstwhile creeps closer and closer to its	docking berth, the vastness of the surrounding	starfield framing it with brilliance as the two	contrasting sized crafts seem to float closer and	closer.					RIKER (O.S.)			Hold it steady, Wesley. We're			ready to link up. On my			command...					WESLEY (O.S.)			Aye Number One.	The Erstwhile reaches the proper point of contact.					RIKER (O.S.)			Easy... easy...				(beat)			Engage. Shut down engines,			Captain Okona.	A laser-like RED BEAM shoots from the Enterprise and	locks into the nose of the Erstwhile and holds it there	in a stationary position. The Erstwhile shuts down.11   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	With the same crew intact except for Worf. Riker is	in his command position. He rises from his position.					RIKER			Transporter Room proceed with			Beaming Operation. I'm on my way.					B.G. ROBINSON'S COM VOICE			Yes, Commander.	Riker, Wesley and Data move to the turbolift and enter.	The door slides shut behind them.    STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE    9.12   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM	Worf and TWO SECURITY MEN bracket the very feminine	and graciously endowed Transporter Commander B.G.	Robinson. Everything she has two of are perfectly	matched, coordinated, and move with a wonderful grace	that is called "woman." B.G. goes through the	procedures of the transfer in her usual professional	manner.13   TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)	The heroic visage of Okona MATERIALIZES and smiles down	at the Group assembled. He is dressed in a	loose-fitting, open-necked blouse, wide belt and casual	looking pants, his look is in opposition to the	well-tailored Enterprise crewmembers. His sidearms	are also less sophisticated and are tucked into his	waistband. The malfunctioning guidance mechanism	swings nonchalantly from the burnt-out wires in his	grasp. Riker nods to Worf who steps forward.					WORF			Your weapons, please.14   CLOSER ANGLE	Okona and Worf study each other openly, that brief	moment of tension when two strong men measure each	other. Okona, still with a trace of a smile on his	face, diminishes some of the apprehension and gives	in to Worf's stature without surrendering..					OKONA			You're the tough one on this ship.			The muscle man.					WORF			Security.					OKONA			That's the usual name for warriors			nowadays.	Okona unclips a belt and hands over all his weapons...	Worf still stands there... Okona's smile broadens and	he reaches behind his back and slips out a long heavy	knife. He hands that to Worf, hilt first.   STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE   10.14   CONTINUED:					OKONA				(continuing)			It's more of a piece of jewelry			than a weapon. A remembrance.	Worf accepts the excuse and the knife calmly, admires	its weight, balance, and sharpness.					WORF			It will be returned when you			leave.	Riker steps forward away from Data and Wesley, extends	his hand. Geordi is also in the room.					RIKER			Welcome aboard, Captain Okona.			I'm Commander Riker.				(shakes hands)			If you turn over the inoperative			part to Lieutenant La Forge he'll			begin repairs.					OKONA			I'd be most happy to do the work			myself, I'm sort of a "hands on"			type...					WORF			That will not be permitted.					OKONA			Can I at least watch? Maybe offer			some suggestions?					RIKER			I think that could be arranged...	Geordi moves closer to Riker to accept the broken part.	Okona, with a twinkle in his eye, reaches around him	and hands it to a rather shocked Wesley.					OKONA			Here you are, Lieutenant. I leave			it in your capable hands.					WESLEY				(reacts)			No, this is Lieutenant La Forge,			I'm only an ensign.   STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE   11.14   CONTINUED: (2)					OKONA			Well ensigns have names, don't			they?					WESLEY			Wesley... Wesley Crusher..					OKONA				(enjoying himself)			Nice to meet you Ensign "Wesley			Wesley" Crusher.	Accepts, Wesley smiles and shakes his hand. Geordi	nods his greeting to Okona, takes the damaged part from	Wesley; but before he can say anything, Okona has moved	across the room to face B.G. Robinson.15   FEATURING OKONA AND B.G.	Okona stands directly in front of her, leans forward	and blocks her view of anything but him. He looks her	directly in the eyes, gets her full attention, then	slowly and with great gentleness takes a few wayward	strands of her hair and tucks it back behind her ear	as he speaks softly to her.					OKONA			And thank you for beaming me here			and inviting me to see a truly			beautiful woman.				(touches her chin)			You have the majestic carriage			and loveliness that could surely			be traced back to the noble			families who once ruled romantic			lands with benevolent and tender			hands.	B.G. smiles openly and knowingly, but plays along...	and Okona develops a hurt look. His eyes continue to	show his humor.					B.G. ROBINSON			I'm sure you said that to many			ladies and it was no more true			then, than it is now.   STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE   12.15   CONTINUED:					OKONA			Of course,				(beat)			But it's how I say it that's most			important. The feeling, the			warmth, the attraction I have for			you,				(soft beat)			the attraction that we share.	B.G. stares at him for a few beats, then throws back	her head and laughs at his absolute but charming	brashness.					B.G. ROBINSON			I haven't heard that approach in			years... it is refreshing...	Okona laughs with her. He knows he's got her now.16   ANGLES ON RIKER, DATA, WORF AND GEORDI	As they watch Okona whispering to B.G., Riker is	appreciating the showmanship and charisma of Okona.	Geordi, glancing over at the transporter station from	time to time and recognizing the situation. Data	merely observes all without any reactions. Riker	comments:					RIKER			Mister Okona seems to have excellent			vision and a healthy libido.					WORF			Which could add to the security			problem. I'll supervise him			closely.					GEORDI				(aware)			I'm sure you will, Worf.	Riker turns away to cover his smile, tells Okona:					RIKER			If you'll follow Lieutenant La			Forge, we'll get right to work.   STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE   13.17   SCENE	Okona reluctantly breaks away from the beautiful B.G.	with a laugh and a squeeze of her hand. As he passes	Data's inquiring eyes, he comments playfully.					OKONA			Now isn't that a beautifully			formed picture of sex appeal?	Data glances from B.G. to Okona with a somewhat puzzled	expression.					DATA			I do not know what you mean.				(beat; then explains)			I am an android.18   CLOSER ANGLE - WALK AND TALK	For the first time Okona is quiet, but then he quickly	recovers with a smile and his usual glibness.					OKONA			Well then... Have you seen any			great looking computers lately?	Riker, Wesley, Worf, and Geordi break up. Data stares	from one to the other with a blank look on his face.	Okona eyes Data.					OKONA				(continuing)			That's a joke.				(beat)			It's funny.					DATA				(still oblivious, but				 covering)			Yes, of course it is.	They continue to walk down the corridor, the look on	Data's face showing his insecurity.   STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE   14.19   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - JEFFERIES TUBE	Geordi and Okona handle the damaged mechanism while	Wesley works on something in the lower platform of the	tube. Wesley can see and hear the conversation. Okona	is quite knowledgeable in this field although limited	to his particular spacecraft. Geordi is more	interested in how he can improve the navigation tool.					GEORDI			It's the Zelebium contacts that			wore down and then fused. Why			not replace them with Tricellite?					OKONA			Tricellite isn't available in this			system. It wouldn't be available			to me if I have to replace it.					GEORDI			I don't think your spacecraft will			outlast the part.	Okona glances at Geordi with the usual twinkle in his	eye and the trace of a smile on his face that is always	ready to broaden.					OKONA				(smiles)			You mean the age of it or the way			I fly it?					GEORDI			The stress test shows that you			tend to push it beyond its			designed capabilities.					OKONA			Lieutenant La Forge, I've never			been told that I'm somewhat			reckless in a kinder, or more			gentlemanly manner; but since the			pattern of my life has relegated			me to interplanetary speed			deliveries rather than universal			exploration, I'm forced to add a			flamboyancy and a zest to the			doldrums of my existence.	Geordi laughs.   STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE   15.20   ANGLE DOWN THE TUBE - TO INCLUDE ALL	Wesley looks up at Okona with some admiration.					WESLEY			Captain Okona, I don't know			whether I'd rather take a flight			with you or listen to you talk.	Okona roars.					OKONA			Thank you Ensign Crusher, Crusher.					WESLEY				(getting into it)			It's Wesley, Wesley.					OKONA			I'll make it easy on both of us.			I'll just call you Tiger.21   NEW ANGLE	Data has entered Engineering in time to hear the end	of the conversation.					DATA			Captain Picard is not fond of			nicknames.					OKONA			Your gallant Captain Picard. I'd			like to meet him... I'll stroll			on the bridge and say hello.					DATA			You are not permitted on the			bridge. You are restricted to			your quarters or the Ten-Forward			lounge unless escorted by a			crewmember.					OKONA				(shrugs)			I've broken some small rules			before.   STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE   16.21   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			You do and besides the bells and			lights that will go off, our			benevolent and kindly Lieutenant			Worf will offer you a new kind			of greeting.					OKONA			Well then, would you escort me			to C deck?	Geordi studies Okona for a beat, then nods his	approval.					GEORDI			I'm busy rebuilding your ship.	Wesley ducks down the Jefferies Tube. Okona glances	over to Data, smiles his best.					OKONA			Then Mister Data sir, I would feel			privileged if you allow me to be			in your company while you escort			me to my destination...	Geordi laughs... Data nods. Okona nods, looks a little	speculative.22   INT. CORRIDOR	Okona and the stolid Data walk down the hallway with	Data slightly in the lead. Okona keeps peeking at Data	but takes a beat or two before he speaks. Then he	finally does.					OKONA			You ever been cold?					DATA			No.					OKONA			How about warm?					DATA			The temperature on this vessel			is regulated to within a fraction			of a degree of the perfect comfort			range. I am also able to react			to any changes just as a humanoid.   STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE   17.22   CONTINUED:	They continue their silent walk.					OKONA			How about drunk? Ever do that?					DATA			That is not possible. One moment.	Data stops dead in his tracks and runs through his	program. Only his eyes show a sort of blinking symbol	as he checks out his circuits for the answer.					DATA				(continuing)			I was correct. I am not designed			to react to any synthenol intake			but apparently it is possible for			me to become intoxicated.					OKONA			I don't understand that at all.					DATA			It seems that I have been adapting			some human peculiarities over the			last three tours of duty.					OKONA			What about love?					DATA			The act or the emotion?					OKONA			They're both the same to me.					DATA			I believe that deduction to be			inaccurate.					OKONA			Maybe.	A sudden sadness comes to his eyes, then is quickly	replaced as he takes Data by the arm and continues his	walk down the corridor in feigned seriousness.					OKONA				(continuing)			Life is like loading twice your			cargo weight on your spacecraft...			if it's canaries and you can keep			half of them flying all the time,			you're all right.   STAR TREK: "The Outrageous Okona" - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE   18.23   ON DATA	He stares at Okona with a blank look ignoring the	laughter that follows.
