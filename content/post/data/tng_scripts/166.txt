CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	PICARD is relaxing on a recliner-type chair, reading	an antique leather-bound book. An empty brandy snifter	is nearby. CLASSICAL MUSIC plays softly.					PICARD (V.O.)			-- a rendezvous with the USS			Hood to assist their terraforming			efforts on Browder Four.	After a moment, Picard lays the book over his chest and	closes his eyes.	Almost immediately, a body-length metallic slab	MATERIALIZES directly over the sleeping Picard. The	slab emits a BEAM which scans the captain from head to	toe. Once the scan is complete, the beam stops and	Picard DEMATERIALIZES in a new, ALIEN TRANSPORTER	EFFECT.4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	RIKER, WORF, DATA, and supernumeraries are at their	posts.

HOLDING BAY	CLOSE on Picard as he slowly awakens and looks around	-- and is stunned to see he's no longer on the	Enterprise. Instead, he's in a large square, empty,	windowless, rather featureless room. One door -- which	is solidly shut.	Each corner of the room contains a "bunk" (a small	padded area slightly raised from floor level); in the	center of the room is a "feeder" (a simple dispenser	filled with what looks like hockey pucks). Picard's on	one "bunk," another is vacant. The remaining two are	occupied by unconscious -- or possibly dead --	humanoids: MITENA HARO (a "Bolian" -- young, female	Starfleet cadet) and KOVA THOLL (a "Mizarian" --	middle-aged male civilian).6    ON PICARD	as he gets to his feet, taps his insignia:					PICARD			Picard to Enterprise.	No response; not even the beep to indicate the	communicator's working.

HOLDING BAY	Picard crosses to the motionless Haro, kneels at her	side, touches her carotid artery to check for pulse.	Haro stirs, awakens -- realizes someone's close, and	panics, reflexively swinging an arm at the stranger.	Picard's ready for it, blocks the blow by seizing	Haro's wrist, whispers to calm her:					PICARD			It's all right. I'm not going			to hurt you.					HARO			Who -- ?	Haro slowly relaxes. Picard lets her go; she sits up,	notices Picard's rank.					HARO (cont'd)			Captain...					PICARD				(nods)			Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.					HARO			Captain Picard! We've studied			your missions at the Academy...	Haro realizes she's being less than professional,	straightens up:					HARO (cont'd)			Mitena Haro, first year cadet,			Starfleet Academy.	Picard nods acknowledgement, but before he can respond:					THOLL (O.S.)			Perhaps you can explain what this			is all about.9    NEW ANGLE	Tholl is sitting up, regarding Picard with a mixture	of suspicion and disdain.      STAR TREK: "Allegiance" - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE      5.9    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Unfortunately, I can't, Mister...					THOLL			Tholl. Kova Tholl, of Mizar Two.					PICARD			Well, Mister Tholl, all I know			is that I've been brought here			against my will.				(gestures)			Wherever "here" is...					HARO			The same thing happened to me,			sir. I was alone, studying...			and I fainted. When I came to...				(gestures)			That was about three days ago.					PICARD				(to Tholl)			And you, sir?					THOLL			I've been here twelve days,			possibly more. I had been			meditating privately -- and for no			reason whatever, I lost			consciousness.					PICARD			What can you tell me about our			captors?					THOLL			Nothing. They've never shown			themselves.      STAR TREK: "Allegiance" - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE      6.10   ON PICARD	as he moves around, inspecting the walls. Haro follows	Picard, keeping a respectful distance.					PICARD			Four sleeping areas... that			implies we'll be joined by another			captive...	Picard stops at the feeder, pulls out a "hockey puck"	-- it's a dark, translucent disk of solid but malleable	material, sort of a gigantic gumdrop. Not very	appealing. Picard pulls off a small hunk, examines	it.					PICARD			Food?					THOLL				(making a face)			It's edible... but I wouldn't call			it food.11   NEW ANGLE	as Picard moves to the door, examines it. Next to the	door is a small panel flush with the wall -- a key	panel? It appears to be -- it's divided into a grid	of sub-panels, each with an alien symbol upon it.	Picard presses one; it lights up briefly and makes a	short, annoying BEEP SOUND. He tries another -- same	result.					THOLL			I wouldn't touch that.					PICARD			Why not?      STAR TREK: "Allegiance" - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE      7.11   CONTINUED:					THOLL			If it's the door lock, the			combination is too complex to hit			at random -- I tried it, and was			punished.					PICARD			Punished -- how?					THOLL			Severe pain... some sort of energy			beam.				(shudders at the memory)			I won't get near that panel			again...	Picard leaves the panel alone for the moment, inspects	the door itself. Haro steps up -- and a little of her	insecurity and fear show through:      STAR TREK: "Allegiance" - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE      8.11   CONTINUED: (2)					HARO			The Enterprise will find us, won't			it, sir? As soon as they discover			you're missing, they'll start to			search... Won't they?	Picard realizes Haro needs a dose of morale-building:					PICARD			Of course they will. They'll do			everything they can. In the			meantime, we keep our heads...				(wryly indicating the				 room)			... and enjoy the hospitality.	Haro takes courage from Picard's words, manages a	smile.					HARO			Yes, sir.12thru	OMITTED1415   INT.

The nearest pulsar			is in the Lonka cluster, is it			not?					DATA			Correct, sir.	Everyone is a bit surprised: why has the captain	brought this up? Unfortunately for them, he's keeping	his reasons to himself.      STAR TREK: "Allegiance" - REV. 1/17/90 - ACT ONE      8A.15   CONTINUED:					FALSE PICARD			And what do we know about that			pulsar?      STAR TREK: "Allegiance" - REV. 1/17/90 - ACT ONE      9.15   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			A great deal, sir.

Engage.	The stars on the viewscreen STREAK into warp. Riker	is slightly puzzled; he half-expects the captain to	elaborate or explain the change in plans.

HOLDING BAY	Picard, Haro, Tholl. Picard is again examining the	keypad next to the door. He thinks it over, starts	pushing just one of the panels in a repeating sequence	of numbers -- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Haro looks on with	interest, Tholl with ill-concealed skepticism.					THOLL			Picard -- what are you doing?					PICARD			Attempting to show our captors			that we possess intelligence.					THOLL			You don't think they know that			already? They can hear us			talking...					PICARD			They may not realize we are			communicating through language.					HARO			Captain Picard's letting them know			that we comprehend mathematics...			by tapping out the first six prime			numbers.	Tholl gives Haro a look -- "you think I'm stupid?"					THOLL			I know what he's doing. I'm			trying to understand why.					PICARD			To get their attention.					THOLL			Oh, you may get their attention,			all right... and they'll give you			a dose of agony for using the			keypad.					PICARD			I'll take the chance. It's			imperative that we communicate			with our abductors... find out			what they want.      STAR TREK: "Allegiance" - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE      13.17   CONTINUED:					THOLL			Obviously, they want us.					PICARD			Obviously. But why? What made			our captors choose us? What makes			us special?	Picard looks from Tholl to Haro. Haro's at a loss.	Her -- "special?"					HARO			I couldn't say, Captain. I'm			certainly not special -- I'm just			one cadet.					PICARD				(points out)			You're a Bolian. There are very			few Bolians in Starfleet.					HARO			I am one of three in the Academy.			The other two have academic			records much better than mine...					PICARD			What's your best area of study?					HARO			Impulse propulsion systems. I'm			really good with field coils...					PICARD			Good enough to be useful to our			abductors?					HARO				(it's a new thought)			I don't know. Maybe.				(a beat)			But if they needed an engineer,			sir, why didn't they take a "real"			one? Why pick a Starfleet cadet?					PICARD			That, I can't answer.				(a beat)			The Bolians are maintaining an			uneasy truce with the Moropa,			are they not?      STAR TREK: "Allegiance" - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE      14.17   CONTINUED: (2)					HARO			That's right.				(looks around)			But this doesn't look like Moropa			technology... and, even assuming			the Moropa wanted me, why would			they want either of you?18   NEW ANGLE	as Picard turns to Tholl, who anticipates his question.					THOLL			I've never even heard of the			Moropa. My race has no enemies.					PICARD				(surprised)			None? In the last three hundred			years of Mizarian history, your			planet has been conquered six			times!					THOLL			And we've survived by not			resisting. Mizarians value peace			above confrontation.					PICARD			Then you have no idea who might			have done this.					THOLL			No. I don't know of anyone who			bears malice toward my race.					PICARD			Or against you personally?					THOLL			You can't mean to suggest that			someone with a personal grudge			against me has gone to all this			trouble...					PICARD			I'm not suggesting anything. I'm			merely trying to come up with an			explanation for your abduction.      STAR TREK: "Allegiance" - REV. 1/22/90 - ACT ONE      15.18   CONTINUED:					THOLL			I'm sorry, Picard -- I can't give			you one.

Tholl and Haro	remain motionless as Picard tries to calm Esoqq:					PICARD			We are prisoners, like yourself!			We are not the enemy!	The command in Picard's voice is compelling.	Gradually, Esoqq lowers the knife, eyes Picard darkly.					ESOQQ			Who has done this?					PICARD			We don't know. We were brought			here the same way you were. Our			captors refuse to show			themselves.	Esoqq, unsure whether to believe Picard or not, looks	as if he may attack at any second.					ESOQQ			I don't trust you...					PICARD			You must trust us.
