ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR AT HOLODECK	Data and Geordi are in front of the Holodeck entrance,	programming the COMPUTER. Geordi (dressed as WATSON)	is wearing Victorian trousers, waistcoat and tie,	jacket and bowler. Data is dressed in the classic	style of SHERLOCK HOLMES.					DATA			Computer -- select at random a			mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,			where I will play Sherlock Holmes			and Lieutenant La Forge will be			Doctor Watson.					COMPUTER VOICE			Program complete -- you may enter.	The Holodeck doors open onto:9    INT. HOLODECK - THE SITTING ROOM AT 221B BAKER	STREET - THE DIGS OF MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES - DAY (OPTICAL)	The Holodeck doors become a wall of Holmes' sitting	room. It's all there. A perfect duplication of	Sherlock Holmes' famous sitting room.					DATA			Excellent.	The unlit oil lamps, the bookcase, the stick rack, the	fireplace and its softly flaming fire within, the	jack-knife stuck in the mantelpiece, the Persian	slipper tobacco pouch, the chemical bottles and	microscope, the deerstalker cap and cape-backed	overcoat, the spirit case and gasogene, a pistol, the	"V.R." script of bullet holes in one wall...					GEORDI			Look at all of the detail... and			everything here has some			significance?      STAR TREK: "Elementary... " - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE      6.9    CONTINUED:					DATA			Holmes collected nothing -- neither			trinkets nor thoughts which were			not specifically significant to			him.10   ANOTHER ANGLE	Data surveys the room for authenticity -- Geordi makes	a walk around the room, picking up articles and	identifying them. He picks up a tie pin.					GEORDI			This?					DATA			The emerald tie pin presented to			Holmes by Queen Victoria after			he solved the theft of the			Bruce-Partington plans.	He touches a book.					DATA				(continuing)			A copy of Whitaker's Almanack			which provided Holmes the key to			the secret code in "The Valley			of Fear."	He picks up a snuff box from the mantel.					DATA				(continuing)			The snuff box of Wilhelm			Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein.	Geordi marvels at the detail.					GEORDI			All right -- you solve the cases			and get the gifts, what do I do?					DATA			Primarily as Doctor Watson, you			keep a written record of			everything I do for later			publication.      STAR TREK: "Elementary... " - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE      7.11   ANOTHER ANGLE	Data steps over and picks up the violin.					DATA			And the famous Holmes violin.			He purchased this in a pawn shop			in Tottenham Court Road for			fifty-five shillings, which he			considered a very good investment.	Geordi takes pen in hand to begin the journal.					GEORDI			In the hands of some, the violin			is a wondrous thing, equally			capable of stirring the soul to			the heights of bliss as to the			depths of despair...11A  EMPHASIZING DATA (OPTICAL)	as he picks up the bow... begins to play. His music	is surprisingly lovely. CAMERA PANS to Geordi as he	lowers the pen, impressed.					GEORDI			Incredible, Data! How can you			play it like that?					DATA			Merely throwing myself into the			part, Watson.	Geordi picks up his pen again, begins writing:					GEORDI			In the masterful grasp of my			friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the			violin ceases to be a musical			instrument at all and becomes...	Data puts down the violin as outside WE HEAR THE CLOMP	OF HORSES' HOOVES AND THE YELL OF A COACHMAN.					DATA			Watson! We are about to have			guests.	Data digs into his pockets for his pipe. There is the	SOUND OF FEET ON THE STAIRS, THEN A KNOCK AT THE	DOOR...      STAR TREK: "Elementary...

LESTRADE and a MAN, wearing	a double-breasted overcoat and bowler... Lestrade nods	at Watson but crosses quickly toward Holmes as the man,	his collar up to partially obscure his face, slides	over to the darkest corner of the room and examines the	chemistry apparatus there...					LESTRADE				(continuing)			Thank the Almighty you're			available tonight, Holmes, I'm			in a deuce of a dilemma.					DATA			Then may I say your perturbation			becomes you, Inspector Lestrade,			whilst simultaneously affording			me yet another chance to serve			Queen and country.					GEORDI				(with a little laugh)			Data, is that the way Holmes			really talked?					DATA			Absolutely.	Data steps over to the Persian slipper tobacco pouch,	fills his pipe, tamps it, as:      STAR TREK: "Elementary...

You see, this gentleman			here --				(indicates the man)			-- the emissary of a foreign			government -- has been the victim			of a most accidentally wicked			crime...	The light over Watson's journal has flickered lower.	Geordi, not quite sure of how it works, tries to adjust	it and breaks Lestrade's concentration as the lamp goes	completely dark.					GEORDI			Damn!				(to Data)			Haven't they invented electric			lights by now?					LESTRADE			What, dear fellow?					DATA			Watson, please!				(to Lestrade)			Pray go on, Inspector.					LESTRADE			Well, to put the matter simply,			Holmes, this man was accosted by			gypsies bent on depriving him of			his most valuable possessions...			and, in the process of picking			his pockets clean, the gypsies			also happened to bag a photograph			this man was carrying --	Data reaches for the lapel of the Man's overcoat, and	RIPS it down, tearing it from top to bottom... and,	from inside the lining of the coat's hem, Data	withdraws a photograph!... which he hands to a	surprised Lestrade...					LESTRADE				(continuing)			Great Scott! It's the photograph!      STAR TREK: "Elementary... " - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE      10.11A  CONTINUED: (3)					DATA			I believe, Inspector, that you			will find that this emissary here			works not for but against the King			of Bohemia, and that photograph			of the king and his ex-mistress			is to be used as blackmail.			Further, upon deeper reflection,			you will deduce, as did I, that...					GEORDI				(in disgust)			Computer, freeze program. Exit!	A set of Holodeck exit doors appears, parting TO REVEAL	the interior corridor of the Enterprise... the Holodeck	characters freeze. Geordi strides toward the exit.					DATA			Where are you going?					GEORDI			I'm done.					DATA			But I was just about to reveal			that the "sir" is in fact a			"madame," and that...					GEORDI			Forget it, Data.	And Geordi strides out... Data puzzles over matters	for a beat, and then he follows. The Holodeck doors	close behind them.12   INT. ENTERPRISE - TEN-FORWARD	Geordi and Data are sitting at a table near the	windows. The Enterprise is not moving.					GEORDI			What was the point to going onto			the Holodeck?					DATA			To solve a Sherlock Holmes			mystery.      STAR TREK: "Elementary... " - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE      11.12   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Exactly, but, you've got them all			memorized. The first time someone			opens their mouth, you've got it			solved. So, there's really no			mystery. If there's no mystery...			there's no game... no game...			no fun.	Geordi feels like he is being too emphatic.					GEORDI				(continuing)			I'm not angry with you, Data,			really... It's just that... we			go to all the trouble to arrange			time to come down to the Holodeck,			to get the proper wardrobe, to			get into character, and, boom,			it barely gets started and you			jump to the end. See, I was			looking forward to the chase.					DATA			Then I should have extended the			sequence of events.					GEORDI			I'm not getting through. The fun			of the program is the attempt to			solve a mystery.					DATA			That is exactly what we were			doing.					PULASKI (O.S.)			You are wasting your breath,			Lieutenant.	And, from behind, DOCTOR PULASKI'S VOICE:	Data and Geordi look around to find PULASKI sitting	there, facing the opposite direction.					PULASKI				(continuing)			Saying that to Data is asking a			computer not to compute.      STAR TREK: "Elementary... " - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE      12.12   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			Am I so different from you,			Doctor? Can you cease thinking			on command?					PULASKI			In medicine I face many puzzles			to which I do not know the answer.					GEORDI			She's right, Data. You always			know the answer.					PULASKI			To feel the thrill of a victory...			there must be the possibility of			failure.				(to Data)			Where's the victory winning a			battle you can't possibly lose?					DATA			Are you suggesting that there is			some value in losing?					PULASKI				(enthusiastic))			Yes. That's the great teacher.			We humans often learn more from			a mistake or a failure than we			do from an easy success. But not			you -- all your learning is by			rote. To you it's all			memorization and recitation.					GEORDI			I don't know about that.			Deductive reasoning is Data's			strength.					PULASKI			Yes, Holmes as well, but Holmes			also understood the human soul.			Those dark flecks which drive			us... which turn the innocent to			the evil. That understanding is			beyond Data. It comes from "life"			experience -- which he doesn't have			-- combined with human intuition			for which he cannot be programmed.      STAR TREK: "Elementary... " - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE      13.12   CONTINUED: (3)					GEORDI			I disagree -- totally.					PULASKI			His victory at playing Sherlock			Holmes is just a blind mimicry,			a collection of bits and bytes			of information without any true			understanding.					GEORDI			You're being unfair.					PULASKI			I don't think so, Lieutenant.			Your artificial friend wouldn't			have a prayer of solving a Holmes			mystery which he hasn't read.					DATA			I have read them all.					GEORDI			Maybe the computer could create			one in the style of Holmes...			where you wouldn't know the			outcome.					PULASKI			Like I said, he wouldn't have a			prayer.					DATA				(to Pulaski)			I accept your challenge, Doctor.					GEORDI			Good for you, Data.					DATA			We will return to the Holodeck			and I will dare it to defeat me,			and you Madam are invited to be			a witness.					PULASKI			I wouldn't miss it.      STAR TREK: "Elementary...
