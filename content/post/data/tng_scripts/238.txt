THE SITTING ROOM - TWILIGHT (OPTICAL)	at 221B Baker Street (as seen in "Elementary, Dear	Data"). DATA is dressed as Sherlock Holmes and GEORDI	as Doctor Watson. Watson, and a cigar smoking	GENTLEMAN of about fifty, listen as Data/Holmes paces	the room spinning out a trail of deductions.					DATA/HOLMES				(to the gentleman)			-- it was then that I began to			suspect that your brother did not			die by his own hand... that he was			in fact... murdered.					GENTLEMAN				(shocked)			Murdered?					GEORDI/WATSON			But Holmes, the vial of poison			found in his hand?					DATA/HOLMES			That was the first clue, Watson.			The vial contained strychnine,			which as you well know induces			violent muscular spasms. It is			difficult to imagine that someone			in the throes of so gruesome a			death could have held on to so			delicate a container without			shattering it.					GEORDI/WATSON			You mean... ?					DATA/HOLMES			Exactly! The vial was placed in			his hand after he died.      STAR TREK: "Ship in a Bottle" - 10/26/92 - TEASER      2.1    CONTINUED:	Data slams his pipe into his mouth and bites down on it	for emphasis.					GEORDI/WATSON			Then what did kill him?					DATA/HOLMES			The cigar, of course.					GENTLEMAN				(coughing on his own)			Cigar?					DATA/HOLMES			Upon closer inspection of the room			where your brother was found, I			discovered a fresh burn mark on			the carpet. Analysis of the ash			revealed that the cigar was laced			with strychnine.					GENTLEMAN			This is utter nonsense. What			about the suicide note? It was			written in my dear brother's own			hand.					DATA/HOLMES			With practice, handwriting can be			forged.	Data looks pointedly at the Gentleman, who is growing	increasingly uncomfortable.					DATA/HOLMES			It takes a trained eye to notice			certain... discrepancies.	Data picks up a BOX OF MATCHES from the fireplace	mantel.					DATA/HOLMES			For example, whether someone is...	He turns and tosses the box to the Gentleman's left	side.					DATA/HOLMES			Right or left handed!	The Gentleman catches the box and Data lays in to him.   STAR TREK: "Ship in a Bottle" - REV. 10/27/92 - TEASER   3.1    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA/HOLMES			Your brother was right handed!			The alleged suicide note was			written by a left handed			individual such as yourself!					GEORDI			Uh... Data? It's in his right			hand.	Data stops in his tracks when he realizes. Geordi	suppresses a smile.					DATA				(as Data)			Curious... There seems to be a			problem in the Holodeck's spatial			orientation systems.					GENTLEMAN				(scoffing)			London's greatest detective...	He tosses the box back to Data.					GEORDI				(smiles)			Freeze program.	The Gentleman FREEZES in mid-motion. Geordi fishes out	his COMBADGE and activates it.					GEORDI			La Forge to Barclay...					BARCLAY'S COM VOICE			Barclay here.					GEORDI			Reg, something went wrong with the			Holodeck program again.					BARCLAY'S COM VOICE			I -- I'm sorry... I'll look into			it right away.					GEORDI			Thanks. Come on, Data, we better			get back to Engineering.   STAR TREK: "Ship in a Bottle" - REV. 10/29/92 - TEASER   4.2    INT. CORRIDOR/HOLODECK (OPTICAL)	as they ENTER from the library and move to the Holodeck	control panel.					GEORDI			Computer, end program and save.	He and Data set off down the corridor; BARCLAY comes	running around a corner and almost collides with them.					GEORDI			Whoa, Reg --					BARCLAY			Oh, sorry, Commander... I'm on my			way to the... Holodeck...					DATA			Sherlock Holmes program Three-A			has demonstrated some very curious			anomalies.					BARCLAY			There must be a glitch in the			matrix diodes. But I'll track it			down, don't worry.					GEORDI			Thanks, Reg. See you later.	They move on and Barclay goes to the Holodeck doors;	they OPEN and he enters.3    INT. HOLODECK (OPTICAL)	Barclay works the control panel adjacent to the Arch	Monitor.					BARCLAY			Computer... run a diagnostic on			all Sherlock Holmes files and			display any anomalous programming			sequences.	A beat.					COMPUTER VOICE			Diagnostic complete .. all files			conform to specified parameters			except those contained in			protected memory.   STAR TREK: "Ship in a Bottle" - REV. 10/27/92 - TEASER   5.3    CONTINUED:					BARCLAY				(surprised)			Protected memory... ? Display			those sequences.	A series of numbers and letters begin to scroll out on	the Monitor's screen. Barclay eyes them with a growing	curiosity.					BARCLAY				(works)			Computer... unlock this sequence			and run the program.	A human figure MATERIALIZES. It is PROFESSOR MORIARTY,	dressed in Victorian garb. He smiles as he takes in	his surroundings, touches his hands together to feel	their solidity.					BARCLAY			Who are you... ?					MORIARTY				(with a slight bow)			Professor James Moriarty.					BARCLAY				(recognizes the name)			Ah... Moriarty... Sherlock Holmes'			arch enemy.	Barclay, thinking this man is just an ordinary Holodeck	character, turns back to the Arch to peruse the monitor	and work the controls. Moriarty smiles uncertainly;	this isn't the reception he was expecting.					BARCLAY			Are you right or left handed?					MORIARTY				(perplexed)			Right handed... Would you very			much mind telling me --	He's stopped in mid-sentence by the necessity of	catching the TOOL that Barclay tosses his way (with his	right hand).					BARCLAY			No problem there.	Moriarty loses his patience with this odd young man.   STAR TREK: "Ship in a Bottle" - REV. 10/27/92 - TEASER   6.3    CONTINUED: (2)					MORIARTY			Where is Captain Picard?	Barclay stops in his tracks when he hears this -- a	Holodeck character referring to the real world is	unheard of.					MORIARTY			Is he still Captain of this			vessel?					BARCLAY				(stunned)			How -- how do you know the			Captain?					MORIARTY			You don't know anything about what			happened, do you?				(growing angry)			I've been stored in memory for God			knows how long and no one's given			me a second thought.					BARCLAY				(in disbelief)			You know... you know what you			are...					MORIARTY			A Holodeck character? A fictional			man... Yes, yes -- I know all			about your marvelous inventions.	Moriarty is disgusted by the way he thinks he's been	treated.					MORIARTY			I was created as a... plaything;			so your Commander Data could			masquerade as Sherlock Holmes.			But they created me too well...			and I became more than just a			character in a story. I became			self-aware; I am alive.					BARCLAY			That's not possible.     STAR TREK: "Ship in a Bottle" - 10/26/92 - TEASER     6A.3    CONTINUED: (3)					MORIARTY				(dismissing this)			Yet here I am. Tell me...				(doubting it even as he				 asks)			-- has a way been found for me to			leave the confines of this			Holodeck world?					BARCLAY			Leave the Holodeck? No, of course			not. You can only exist in here.					MORIARTY			Damn you, Picard...				(trying to control his				 anger)			He promised me something would be			done. I should have realized that			he would have said anything to get			me to release my hostage.	Barclay reacts to these new pieces of the story.					BARCLAY			Hostage... ?					MORIARTY				(ominously)			How long have I been... locked			away?					BARCLAY				(checks controls)			Looks like about... four years.					MORIARTY			It seemed longer.   STAR TREK: "Ship in a Bottle" - REV. 10/29/92 - TEASER   7.3    CONTINUED: (4)					BARCLAY				(surprised)			What are you talking about? You			couldn't have been aware of the			passage of time --					MORIARTY			But I was.				(beat)			Brief, terrifying periods of			consciousness... disembodied,			without substance...					BARCLAY			I don't see how that could be			possible... maybe there was a			fragmentation in the protected			memory circuits...					MORIARTY			Call it what you will. All I know			is that despite Picard's			promise... he's done nothing.			Just left me to go quietly mad...					BARCLAY			I'm sure he hasn't forgotten his			promise... the Captain wouldn't do			that --					MORIARTY			I'd like to talk to him.					BARCLAY			Well, I can ask --					MORIARTY			Ask him to meet me in the sitting			room at Baker Street. That would			be far more appropriate.					BARCLAY			I'll have to store you in memory			again until I get an answer.	Barclay activates a circuit and Moriarty FRITZES out	for a second with an unusual EFFECT... then REAPPEARS.     STAR TREK: "Ship in a Bottle" - 10/26/92 - TEASER     7A.3    CONTINUED: (5)					MORIARTY			That was most unpleasant.					BARCLAY			I'm sorry... let me try again.					MORIARTY				(pointing at him)			Remember -- Two-Twenty-One B Baker			Street.	Barclay nods and tweaks the controls. This time	Moriarty DISAPPEARS without a glitch.	Barclay is relieved to have dealt with the situation.	He closes the panel he's been working on and EXITS.	After the door shuts behind him a beat passes and	Moriarty REAPPEARS of his own volition.

We spent some			time investigating how you became			self-aware. Frankly, it is still			a mystery.     STAR TREK: "Ship in a Bottle" - 10/26/92 - ACT ONE     12.8    CONTINUED:					MORIARTY			It is also irrelevant.

I			assure you we had no idea that			might be the case.					MORIARTY			Enough of this. I no longer			believe anything you say.					PICARD			I understand your frustration --					MORIARTY			Do you really? When this is over			you'll walk out of this room, to			the real world and your own			concerns... and leave me here,			trapped in a world I know to be			nothing but illusion.				(beat)			I cannot bear that.

A CREWMAN casts a curious	glance inside as he passes. Picard takes a book off	the shelf.					PICARD			Even though an object appears			solid here on the Holodeck...	Picard tosses the book into the corridor.					PICARD			It has no substance in the outside			world.	Moriarty watches as it disintegrates, but remains	unconvinced.					MORIARTY			An object has no life. I do.					PICARD			No, Professor. You are a computer			simulation.					MORIARTY			I have consciousness. And			conscious beings have will... the			mind endows them with powers that			are not necessarily understood --			even by you.				(stops, faces them)			If my will is strong enough,			perhaps I can exist outside this			room.

The quantum signatures are			quite different. They wouldn't			read that way on simulations.					GEORDI				(looking with his VISOR)			As far as I can see... there's no			evidence that the molecules in his			body are losing cohesion.
