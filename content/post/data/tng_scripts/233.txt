SPACE - SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)	A lonely craft against a starry background.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log, Stardate 46235.7			Ensign Ro, Keiko O'Brien, Guinan			and I are returning to the			Enterprise after a fascinating			visit to the planet Marlonia.2    INT. SHUTTLECRAFT - IN FLIGHT	PICARD, GUINAN, KEIKO and RO are in the back of the	shuttle, relaxing. The atmosphere is very informal.	Picard is still energized by his recent trip and is	showing Guinan some odd pieces of pottery from a small	box.					PICARD			... and I found these pieces in			the tertiary level of the dig.			They're typical of second century			Marlonian cookware.	Guinan looks at the shards of pottery... she really	doesn't share the Captain's interest in this stuff.					GUINAN			Mmmm-hmmmm.					PICARD			Now, see these markings...			they're very similar to some early			Taguan designs... but the			patterns are more intricate...			closer to Buranian than Taguan.	Picard looks expectantly at Guinan, but she is less	than enthused by this revelation.        STAR TREK: "Rascals" - REV. 9/09/92 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:					GUINAN			So... you went to one of the most			beautiful planets in this quadrant			and spent your entire shore			leave... in a cave.					PICARD			It was a very rewarding			experience.				(holds up shards)			Look at these fragments... they're			in nearly perfect condition...			and they're over seven hundred			years old.					GUINAN			So's my father.	Picard can see he's not going to win any converts here,	so he carefully puts the shards back in his box.3    NEW ANGLE	Ro is looking at the collection of bagged plants that	Keiko is holding in a small tray.					RO				(indicates one plant)			Is that a Draebidium Froctus?					KEIKO			Draebidium Calimus actually...			you can tell by the shape of the			leaves.	Ro nods and turns back to the console. But Keiko	suddenly realizes something.					KEIKO			I didn't know you were interested			in plant biology.					RO				(a little embarrassed)			I... took a class at the			Academy... I just remember a few			things...	Before Keiko can pursue this any further, Ro is saved	by Worf's Com Voice.        STAR TREK: "Rascals" - REV. 9/08/92 - TEASER        3.3    CONTINUED:					WORF'S COM VOICE			Enterprise to Shuttlecraft			Fermi...					RO				(works)			This is the Fermi. Go ahead			Enterprise.					WORF'S COM VOICE			We have just received a distress			signal from the Starfleet science			team on Ligos Seven.					PICARD			Any indication of the problem?					WORF'S COM VOICE			No, sir. The call was cut off			mid-transmission.					PICARD			Lay in a course and prepare to			engage at Warp eight once we're			aboard.					WORF'S COM VOICE			Aye, sir.	The transition to 'business' is immediate and absolute.	Picard looks to Ro.					RO			We'll rendezvous with the ship			in three minutes, sir.4    EXT. SPACE - SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)	The shuttle is confronted by a bright FLASH that erupts	directly in the craft's path. The light quickly fades	leaving only an incandescent CLOUD-LIKE ANOMALY in its	wake.	As the shuttle approaches the anomaly, its vapors	quickly enveloping the craft...5    INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)	There's a sudden JOLT and the craft begins to SHAKE,	caught in the grip of some phenomenon.        STAR TREK: "Rascals" - REV. 9/08/92 - TEASER        4.5    CONTINUED:	Picard and Ro quickly move to the pilot area and start	to work the console.					RO				(reading instruments)			We're caught in some kind of			energy field.					PICARD			Hard about, full impulse.					RO			Aye, sir.	Picard, Keiko, Guinan and Ro, buffeted about. WHIRR,	the power goes down. Red warning LIGHTS flash, a	KLAXON sounds.6thru	OMITTED78    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship at impulse power.9    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	RIKER, DATA, and WORF at their stations, various	SUPERNUMERARIES.					RIKER				(to Worf)			What's happening, Mister Worf?					WORF			The shuttle's been enveloped by			an energy field, sir.					(MORE)           STAR TREK: "Rascals" - 9/04/92 - TEASER           5.9    CONTINUED:					WORF (Cont'd)			Their engines and life support			have failed.					RIKER				(to Conn officer)			Increase to full impulse.				(to com)			Bridge to Transporter Room Three.			Prepare to beam the shuttle crew			aboard once we're in range.					O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE			Ready, sir.10   OMITTED11   INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)	Red alert... all power gone... the SHAKING is really	VIOLENT now.					RO			There's too much interference...			I can't contact the Enterprise...					PICARD			Transfer auxiliary power to the			inertial dampers...					COMPUTER VOICE			Warning. Structural failure			imminent.	Suddenly the ENERGY FIELD penetrates the hull and	fills the inside of the shuttle. Everyone reacts...12   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	O'Brien working feverishly at the controls.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			O'Brien, do you have them?        STAR TREK: "Rascals" - REV. 9/09/92 - TEASER        6.12   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(to Com)			I'm trying, sir... I can't get			a pattern lock.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			The shuttle's coming apart, Chief.			You've got to do it now.	Beat.					O'BRIEN			I've got them.				(works)			There's a forty percent drop in			mass. I may have lost one of			them...	He works and FOUR SMALL FIGURES begin to MATERIALIZE on	the platform.13   ANGLE ON O'BRIEN	A low angle looking up at O'Brien from the POV of the	Transporter platform. He reacts with shock to what	he sees.14   NEW ANGLE	Revealing that the entire shuttle crew has now been	turned into twelve year old children. YOUNG PICARD,	YOUNG RO, YOUNG GUINAN, and YOUNG KEIKO all wear the	same clothes the adults wore in the shuttle, but now	they're a few sizes too big for them. For a split	second, Young Picard is unaware of what's happened.	(NOTE: Young Keiko is now carrying a tray of sprouted	seedlings.)					YOUNG PICARD			Thank you, Mister O'Brien.			Another moment and...	He trails off at the sound of his own voice. He and	the others look at each other in shock. Off their	reactions...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  STAR TREK: "Rascals" - REV. 9/11/92 - ACT ONE        7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            15   INT. SICKBAY	BEVERLY, medical tricorder in hand, finishes her	examination of Young Picard. Troi is with her. In the	b.g., Young Ro, Young Guinan and Young Keiko sit on	biobeds while an N.D. conducts tests with a tricorder.	NOTE: "child" versions now wear smaller, replicated	clothes, with normal sized insignias. They are still	examining the fit of their new clothes.	As the "grown ups" talk, we can see Young Picard grow	impatient as they talk above and about him, as if he	weren't even there. Beverly is reporting to Riker.					BEVERLY				(to Riker)			According to the bio-scans, their			DNA structures are now consistent			with those of pre-adolescents.			But as far as I can tell, only			their bodies have changed.					TROI				(off PADD)			Their individual intelligence and			behavioral responses are all			exactly the same as they were			before the accident.	Young Picard finally intercedes.					YOUNG PICARD			What happened to the shuttlecraft,			Number One?	Riker looks down, blinks for a moment as if to remind	himself that this is Jean-Luc Picard, and then answers.        STAR TREK: "Rascals" - REV. 9/11/92 - ACT ONE        8.15   CONTINUED:					RIKER			The shuttle broke up just after			we beamed you out. Data's			coordinating the salvage effort			right now.				(beat)			Sir.					BEVERLY			What about the energy field the			shuttle passed through?					RIKER			We've been trying to scan it, but			it's putting out a lot of			interference. It's going to take			some time.	Again Young Picard makes them include him in this	conversation.					YOUNG PICARD			We can't afford to stay here any			longer. We'll leave a class four			probe behind to study the energy			field but the distress signal			from Ligos Seven has top priority.				(to Beverly)			Let me know as soon as you have			any further information, Doctor.			Number One, you're with me.	Young Picard heads for the door.					BEVERLY			Captain... there are some			additional tests I'd like to			run...					YOUNG PICARD			Of course...				(to other 'children')			The three of you will remain as			needed to assist Doctor Crusher.	Young Picard EXITS with Riker. As Troi and Beverly	exchange a look of concern...          STAR TREK: "Rascals" - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE          9.16   ANGLE - YOUNG RO AND YOUNG GUINAN	Young Ro sits on her biobed obviously not pleased with	any of this. She opens and closes her fingers, not	quite able to realize that these are now her hands.	Young Guinan is more serene as usual and seems to be	taking this all with a slight air of amusement. She	studies Young Ro for a beat, who finally notices.					YOUNG RO			What?					YOUNG GUINAN			You know... you make a pretty			cute kid.					YOUNG RO			Great. Just what I want to be...			cute.					YOUNG GUINAN				(sarcastic)			Were you this much fun when you			were a kid?					YOUNG RO			I was in a refugee camp. "Fun"			wasn't exactly in my vocabulary.					YOUNG GUINAN			What about now? You're not in			that camp anymore.					YOUNG RO			"Fun" is being back at work...			in my own uniform.	On Young Guinan's reaction...17   INT. TURBOLIFT	Riker and Young Picard ENTER.					YOUNG PICARD			Bridge.	They stand side by side, an awkward and silent moment	for both of them. Riker can't help glancing down at	this youthful version of the man he's known and served	under for six years. The Turbolift finally STOPS and	the doors open.       STAR TREK: "Rascals" - REV. 9/08/92 - ACT ONE       10.18   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS	Data, GEORDI, and Worf are at their stations along with	N.D. Crewmembers. Young Picard and Riker ENTER from	the Turbolift. Young Picard moves directly to Worf,	who looks down with astonishment at his captain.					YOUNG PICARD			Mister Worf. Prepare to launch			a class four probe to study the			energy field.	Worf is unable to respond for a moment and Young Picard	suddenly becomes aware of a great silence on the	Bridge. He looks around and sees that every highly	disciplined head is gaping at their captain.					YOUNG PICARD				(to everyone)			I realize how unusual this must			seem...				(just the facts)			My appearance is the result of			an accident, involving myself and			three other crew members... the			effects of which Doctor Crusher			is currently working to remedy.				(in charge)			I assure you, I am Captain Picard.	Riker nods his assent and everyone returns to their	duties. Young Picard looks expectantly at Worf for	a beat.					WORF				(quickly)			The probe. Aye, sir.	He turns to work at his console as Beverly ENTERS from	a Turbolift in the b.g.					YOUNG PICARD			Mister Data, have you secured all			of the shuttle debris?					DATA			Almost, sir. It is being stored			in Shuttlebay Two.					YOUNG PICARD			Very well.				(to Conn)			Ensign, as soon as Mister Data			is finished take us to Ligos at			warp eight.          STAR TREK: "Rascals" - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE          11.18   CONTINUED:	Beverly quietly moves next to him.					BEVERLY			Captain, may I see you privately			for a few moments?					YOUNG PICARD			Of course.	They EXIT to the Ready Room.19   INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS	Beverly and the young Captain ENTER. Young Picard is	in charge, trying to continue on in his normal fashion.	He moves to the replicator.					YOUNG PICARD			Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.				(he gets the cup of tea)			Have you been able to determine			the cause of our transformation?					BEVERLY			Not yet. I'm still waiting for			some test results.					YOUNG PICARD			I see.	Young Picard sits down at the desk and turns on the	terminal.					YOUNG PICARD				(off terminal)			There are one hundred and three			members of the science team on			Ligos Seven. We should prepare			shuttlebay three for a triage			center in case they have large			numbers of casualties.					BEVERLY			We'll be ready.          STAR TREK: "Rascals" - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE          12.19   CONTINUED:					YOUNG PICARD			Ligos Seven is prone to periodic			volcanic activity... perhaps the			planet has entered an active			phase---					BEVERLY			Jean-Luc.				(he looks up)			I think we need to talk.	Young Picard knows what she's getting at and he faces	her head-on.					YOUNG PICARD			All right. Let's talk.				(beat)			Are you here to relieve me of			duty?					BEVERLY			I'd rather not have to take that			step.					YOUNG PICARD			I am still Jean-Luc Picard. My			judgement, my experiences, my			mental capacities are all			intact.					BEVERLY			That's true... for now. This			could be the first stage of a			condition which may begin to			affect your mind as well.					YOUNG PICARD			But you've seen no evidence of			that?					BEVERLY			Not yet.				(beat)			What I do know is that the Captain			of this ship has just gone through			an extreme physical			transformation... the ultimate			effects of which I can't even			begin to guess.          STAR TREK: "Rascals" - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE          13.19   CONTINUED: (2)					YOUNG PICARD				(quiet)			You are asking me to step down.	There is a quiet beat before Beverly replies.					BEVERLY			You're still Jean-Luc Picard...			what do you think you should do?	As Young Picard thinks over the stakes involved...                                           CUT TO:20   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	As before. Young Picard and Beverly ENTER from the	Ready Room. He goes directly to Riker and there is no	trace of hesitation or regret at his decision.					YOUNG PICARD				(formally)			Commander Riker, please take			command of the ship until further			notice.					RIKER			Understood, sir.	And with that, Young Picard and Beverly head for the	EXIT.                                             CUT TO:21   INT. CORRIDOR	Young Ro and Young Guinan ENTER from Sickbay. Young Ro	is very irritated as they pause in the Corridor.					YOUNG RO			So what the hell am I supposed			to do now?					YOUNG GUINAN			You're not supposed to do			anything. That's what "relieved			of duty" means.	Young Guinan looks up at the ceiling... jumps up and	tries to touch it, but can't. She smiles in delight.          STAR TREK: "Rascals" - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE          14.21   CONTINUED:					YOUNG RO			Well, I should be doing			something... instead of just			standing around waiting for them			to find a cure.					YOUNG GUINAN			You're right.				(beat)			Let's go play.					YOUNG RO			What?					YOUNG GUINAN			I haven't been young for a long			time... and I intend to enjoy			every minute of it.					YOUNG RO			Fine. Enjoy yourself.	Young Ro heads down the Corridor toward a Turbolift.					YOUNG GUINAN				(following her)			What are you going to do... go			back to your room and pout?	Young Ro stops dead in her tracks and turns on Young	Guinan.					YOUNG RO			I am not twelve years old. If			I want to go to my quarters and			contemplate my situation, it does			not mean that I am... pouting.					YOUNG GUINAN			Okay, okay.	Young Ro turns and continues toward the Turbolift.	Young Guinan makes a face at Young Ro's back... then	smiles to herself with the simple pleasure of acting	like a girl again... then she follows Young Ro.22   INT. O'BRIEN QUARTERS	Young Keiko and O'Brien sit on the couch. There is a	long, awkward silence between them as they struggle to	make sense of the situation.          STAR TREK: "Rascals" - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE          15.22   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				( awkward)			I could use a... cup of coffee.			How about you?	It's obvious O'Brien's more in need of a distraction	than any beverage. He moves to get up, but Young Keiko	gestures him back into his chair and walks over to the	replicator...					YOUNG KEIKO			I'll get it.				(to companel)			Two coffees... one with cream...					O'BRIEN				(interjects)			Black... double sweet...					YOUNG KEIKO			I know.				(to companel)			One double sweet.	Young Keiko picks up the two cups of steaming coffee	and starts toward O'Brien.					O'BRIEN			Careful... that's hot...					YOUNG KEIKO				(a warning)			Miles...					O'BRIEN			Sorry.	Young Keiko hands him a cup and sits down next to him.	A sadness falls over her features... this is a lot to	absorb. Young Keiko instinctively cuddles up next to	him, looking for comfort. But this has the opposite	effect on O'Brien. He stands up... suddenly very	uncomfortable with this kind of intimacy.					YOUNG KEIKO			What's wrong?					O'BRIEN			It's... I don't know... but this			feels wrong, somehow.	Young Keiko stands. Their voices slowly get louder as	they grapple with complex emotions.             STAR TREK: "Rascals" - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE          16.22   CONTINUED: (2)					YOUNG KEIKO			Miles Edward O'Brien. I am still			your wife.					O'BRIEN			Technically, yes.					YOUNG KEIKO			Technically?					O'BRIEN			No. I mean, of course you're my			wife... but you're also ten years			old.					YOUNG KEIKO			Beverly said it's actually closer			to twelve.					O'BRIEN			That's not the point.					YOUNG KEIKO			So what is the point? Is our			marriage over?					O'BRIEN			I didn't say that. But until they			find a way to reverse this... this			effect... it's going to be hard			for me to ignore the fact that			you're a little girl.					YOUNG KEIKO			What if they can't find a way?			What if I'm like this the rest			of my life? What does that mean			for us, for our family?					MOLLY'S VOICE			Mommy?	They both look toward the bedroom. After a beat, they	both move to the door.23   INT. MOLLY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS	MOLLY is lying in her bed as O'Brien and Young Keiko	ENTER.          STAR TREK: "Rascals" - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE          17.23   CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(to Molly)			What's wrong, Sweetheart?					MOLLY			I want Mommy to read me a story.					YOUNG KEIKO			All right.

Beverly pulls	out her tricorder and gives him a quick scan.					BEVERLY			How do you feel, Captain?	He looks around the room for a few seconds. He reaches	up and runs a hand over his head where hair was only	a moment ago.					PICARD			I feel fine.

A sad, lonely portrait.	ADULT Guinan ENTERS, sitting at the desk next to Young	Ro's. As she leans over to see Young Ro's drawing.	It's a simple, elegant drawing of a woman's face.					YOUNG RO			It's my mother.				(beat)			The funny thing is... I never			really drew a picture of her when			I was young... but for some reason			I wanted to now.	Guinan looks down and sees several other crayon	drawings... ships, people, planets, etc.					GUINAN			That's the wonderful thing about			crayons... when you're a child,			they can take you to more places			than a starship.           STAR TREK: "Rascals" - REV. 9/09/92 - ACT FIVE           64.93   CONTINUED:	Young Ro nods thoughtfully.					YOUNG RO			It's my turn, isn't it?					GUINAN			Only if you're ready.	Young Ro looks around the room for a moment.					YOUNG RO			It's not quite as bad as I			remembered it... being a child,			I mean.	A long beat. And there is a definite trace of sadness	in Young Ro's voice.					YOUNG RO			We better get going.	She begins to stand up, but Guinan stops her.					GUINAN				(warmly)			There's no hurry. The Transporter			will still be there... pass me			the burnt umber.	A moment as Young Ro looks up into Guinan's face...	then Young Ro smiles in heartfelt gratitude and they	begin to pick up the crayons...                                             FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
