Everyone CONTINUES THEIR	MOTION as if nothing is wrong. Only Troi has noticed	what happened.					GEORDI				(continuing dialogue)			-- went all the way down my chest.			It was kind of like taking a bath			in pure energy.					DATA			It was not painful?					GEORDI			Not at all.

Data is sitting at a table,	staring intently at a small TEA KETTLE, which is on a	burner.	The door CHIMES.					DATA			Come in.	Riker ENTERS, glances around, a little nervous.					RIKER				(to Data)			Where's that cat of yours?	Data does not look up from the kettle.					DATA			Spot is sleeping, sir. Why do you			ask?					RIKER			No reason...	Riker crosses to Data, hands him a PADD.					RIKER			I've worked out the new rotation			schedules. I'd like you to cross			check the personnel assignments			and notify all department heads.					(MORE)          STAR TREK: "Timescape" - REV. 04/06/93 - ACT FIVE        56B.101  CONTINUED:					RIKER (Cont'd)				(beat)			Your new Bridge shift begins at			twenty-three hundred hours.	Data takes the PADD without looking up -- his attention	remains fixed on the kettle.					DATA			Understood, sir.	Riker eyes him.          STAR TREK: "Timescape" - REV. 04/02/93 - ACT FIVE         57.101  CONTINUED:	Data watches the kettle. A beat goes by. Then the	kettle begins to WHISTLE. Data looks thoughtful.					RIKER			Data, what are you doing?					DATA			Recent events have compelled me to			study how humans perceive the			passage of time.				(beat)			For example, I have often heard			people comment that time seems to			pass more "slowly" in one			instance, or more "quickly" in			another. Yet in reality, the			actual passage of time remains			fixed.	Riker considers.					RIKER			I guess everybody perceives time			a little differently... it depends			on the exact situation... how			you're feeling...	Data indicates the kettle.					DATA			I have been testing the aphorism			that "a watched pot never boils".				(beat)			I have boiled the same amount of			water in this kettle sixty-two			times. In some cases, I ignored			the kettle.					(MORE)          STAR TREK: "Timescape" - REV. 03/31/93 - ACT FIVE        57A.101  CONTINUED: (2)					DATA (Cont'd)			In others, I watched it intently.			In every instance, the water			reached its boiling point in			precisely fifty-one point seven			seconds.	They stare at the kettle a moment.            STAR TREK: "Timescape" - 03/29/93 - ACT FIVE            58.101  CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			It would appear that I am not			capable of perceiving time any			differently than my internal			chronometer.	Riker thinks.					RIKER			Why don't you turn it off?					DATA			Sir?					RIKER			Data... people don't have internal			chronometers. See what happens			when you turn yours off.	Data looks intrigued.					DATA			Thank you, Commander. I will try			that.	Riker smiles.					RIKER			Just don't be late for your shift.	Riker gives Data a smile, and EXITS. Data watches him	a moment. Suddenly, we hear the kettle WHISTLE. Data	turns quickly at the sound. OFF his intrigued	expression as he watches the pot...                                             FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FIVE                                                     THE END
