BEVERLY	CRUSHER wears a beautiful dress; REGINALD BARCLAY, has	the clothes of a duellist -- and a LARGE NOSE. They	are doing CYRANO DE BERGERAC.					BEVERLY			-- You were like a brother to			me. We played in the park near			the lake.					BARCLAY			Of course -- Every summer you			came to Bergerac!					BEVERLY			You used to make swords out of			the reeds -- And when you cut			your hand, you would run to			me, and I would say --				(taking his hand)			"Let me see --"	She sees real blood on the hand from a cut, and reacts.					BEVERLY			Oh! How did you do that?					BARCLAY			"Playing" near the Porte de			Nesle.	She wets a handkerchief and starts to wash his hand.					BEVERLY			And how many were against you?					BARCLAY			No more than a hundred.					BEVERLY			Tell me!     STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - REV. 1/30/91 - TEASER     2.1    CONTINUED:					BARCLAY			No... Let it go. You tell me			what you were going to say. Do			you dare?					BEVERLY				(still holding his hand)			I do dare... I love someone.					BARCLAY			Ah!					BEVERLY			But he does not know.					BARCLAY			Ah!					BEVERLY			Not yet. He is proud, noble,			brave and beautiful --					BARCLAY				(turns pale, quickly				 rises)			Beautiful!					BEVERLY			What's the matter?					BARCLAY				(smiling to cover it)	With me? Nothing. Just my hand.				(beat)			He is in the Guards?					BEVERLY			Since this morning. Baron			Christien de Neuvillette. In your			own regiment.					BARCLAY			Ah...					BEVERLY			Promise to be his friend.					BARCLAY			I promise.					BEVERLY			And never let him fight a duel.    STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - REV. 1/30/91 - TEASER    2A.1    CONTINUED: (2)					BARCLAY			God forbid.					BEVERLY			Oh, I love you.				(standing)			I must go now. You never told			me what happened last night.			And tell him to write me. A			hundred men against one. To			write, remember. A hundred men!			What courage!					BARCLAY				(aside to audience)			Oh... I have done better since...	Barclay holds the moment in character. He is met with	applause.     STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - REV. 1/29/91 - TEASER     3.2    INCLUDE AUDIENCE	RIKER, DATA, GEORDI, TROI, WORF, and a few	supernumeraries still clapping.					RIKER			Bravo.					TROI			Wonderful.	Data reacts with puzzlement to the applause. He	himself has not joined in.					DATA				(to Riker)			Lieutenant Barclay's performance			was superficially adequate but			clearly not rooted in The Method			approach. As a result, his			customary anxiety was evident.			I do not understand why...					RIKER				(still clapping)			-- Because it's polite, Data.	Data considers for a beat, and joins in the applause	as it finishes. Beverly and Barclay step off the	"stage" area to meet their friends, who stand to greet	them.					GEORDI				(re: Barclay)			Not a bad showing after only six			weeks of lessons.					BEVERLY			Not a bad showing period.					BARCLAY				(sheepish, re: Beverly)			I... we have a very... patient			teacher.	Beverly eyes Worf.					BEVERLY			There's an opening in my			workshop... Worf.	Worf grunts his disapproval of the suggestion, and the	others laugh as the group begins to break up.       STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - 1/25/91 - TEASER       4.3    ON TROI AND BARCLAY					TROI			Well done.					BARCLAY			Thank... thank you...			Counselor...	Barclay is more confident than we saw him in his debut	episode, but still a far cry from Enterprise norm (he	still has trouble meeting another's gaze). And he's	noticeably even less sure of himself than he appeared	in the acting scene only moments ago.					TROI			You've come a long way, Reg.					BARCLAY			After... more rehearsals than I			can count.					TROI			I don't just mean your acting			ability. It takes a great deal			of courage to put yourself on			display like that.					BARCLAY			You think so...					TROI				(acknowledges)			There was a time when nothing			could have dragged you onto a			stage in front of an audience.			You've made tremendous progress.					BARCLAY			I... I guess...	He's hesitant. She picks up on it, encourages him.					TROI			Don't you think so?					BARCLAY			Well...	She waits him out for a beat. He indicates his	costume.       STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - 1/25/91 - TEASER       5.3    CONTINUED:					BARCLAY				(continuing)			I still feel more... more			comfortable playing somebody else.			Maybe all this is no better than			escaping into a holodeck fantasy.					TROI			I disagree. This isn't fantasy			-- it's theatre. You used to			withdraw into the holodeck. You			isolated yourself inside your own			imagination, avoiding contact with			real people.	She indicates the stage.					TROI				(continuing)			Look at yourself now... and look			at all the other people you're			with... you're not just acting,			you're inter-acting. Give			yourself some credit, Mister			Barclay!	He nods.					BARCLAY			Maybe... you're right.	Troi smiles and goes out the door. Stay on Barclay,	alone in costume, audience gone. Despite some	progress, we get a sense of just how painful it still	is to be Barclay.4    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise hovering in front of the ARGUS ARRAY.	It is a huge subspace radio telescope -- a series of	panels, resembling several very long box-kites stacked	one on top of the other. It looks absolutely immense.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 44704.2.			We have arrived at the Argus			Array, the remote subspace			telescope at the very edge of			Federation space.					(MORE)       STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - 1/25/91 - TEASER       6.4    CONTINUED:					PICARD (Cont'd)			The unmanned structure			mysteriously stopped relaying its			data nearly two months ago.5    INT. BRIDGE	PICARD, Riker, Worf, Data, Geordi and ENSIGN APRIL	ANAYA.					DATA			The fusion reactors that power			the array are extremely unstable.			The risk of overload is high.					RIKER			What about the computer systems?					DATA				(testing panels)			They do not seem to be functioning			at all.					WORF				(off instruments)			Captain! I am picking up an			unidentified device! One point			eight kilometers from the array!					PICARD			Onscreen.6thru	OMITTED78    INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN -- THE PROBE (OPTICAL)	We see a panel of the Array, and hanging in front of	it, a silent, probe-like device.					PICARD			Magnify.	The image on the viewscreen is replaced by a highly	MAGNIFIED VIEW of the probe.					RIKER			Some kind of probe. I'll bet			that's what damaged the array.     STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - REV. 1/28/91 - TEASER     7.8    CONTINUED:					PICARD				(to Worf)			Is it emitting any signals,			Lieutenant?					WORF			Negative, sir. I show no			activity.					PICARD			Mister La Forge, why don't you			go out and take a closer look.					GEORDI				(exiting)			Aye, sir.				(to Com)			Mister Barclay, report to			Main Shuttlebay.	As the turbolift closes behind Geordi, OFF Picard as	he stares at the viewscreen...9    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The shuttle is already in space... moving away from the	ship.10   INT. SHUTTLE	Geordi at the helm, Barclay at his station.					GEORDI			Enterprise, this is Shuttle Five,			in position. Ready to begin			short-range scan.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Proceed, Shuttle Five.11   INCLUDE SHUTTLE WINDOW (OPTICAL)	At this close distance, the Array can be seen only as a	grey, metallic backdrop. Hanging motionless in front	of it, only meters from the shuttle, is the alien	probe, vaguely cylindrical, about ten meters tall and	three wide.       STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - 1/25/91 - TEASER       8.11   CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(to Barclay)			Let's start with the passive high			res series.	Barclay is a little nervous, but it's combined with an	excitement about being there.					BARCLAY			Electromagnetic band?					GEORDI			Give it a try.	Barclay nods and touches his instrument panel.					BARCLAY			I'm picking up visual wavelengths			only. Between forty-five...			forty-five hundred and seven			thousand angstroms.					GEORDI			Try the neutron densitometer.	Barclay touches the panel.					BARCLAY			Nothing.					GEORDI			Hmmmm. Doesn't seem to want to			give up any secrets. Let's go			to active scan.	Barclay keys it in. They're both surprised at the	instruments.					BARCLAY			No... No modulation.					GEORDI				(to probe)			You are definitely not from our			neighborhood.				(to Barclay)			Increase to three point zero.	Barclay does so. Glances over at Geordi.       STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - 1/25/91 - TEASER       9.11   CONTINUED: (2)					BARCLAY				(hesitantly)			Commander?					GEORDI			Yeah, Reg?					BARCLAY			Thanks for... for assigning me			to this mission.					GEORDI			Don't mention it. You're one of			my top engineers. It's about time			you started to do the interesting			stuff.				(re: situation)			This is why I'm in Starfleet.					BARCLAY				(off instruments)			Still no modulation.					GEORDI			Hit it with the positron emission.	Barclay touches his panel -- the probe responds with a	BLINDING FLASH of white light that lights up the entire	inside of the shuttle for an instant before shutting	down again.					GEORDI				(continuing)			What was that?				(looking at instruments)			Our computer is down!	He glances over -- Barclay is slumped back in his	chair, unconscious. Geordi is alarmed. He shakes	Barclay.					GEORDI			Reg! Reg!	Geordi puts a finger on Barclay's neck to feel for a	pulse. OFF the concern on his face.									FADE OUT:                         END OF TEASER                                STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - 1/25/91 - ACT ONE      10.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:12   EXT.

BRIDGE	Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Ensign Anaya.					RIKER			Any indication of the probe's			energy source, Data?					DATA			No sir. Power emissions do not			match any known radiation			patterns. We have not encountered			this technology before.					PICARD			Very well. Isolate the probe and			place it in tow. We'll take it			to Science Station Four-Oh-Two			in the Kohlan system...					WORF				(interrupting)			Captain. The probe has begun to			move.

SICKBAY	Barclay is sitting up on a diagnostic bed, looking	completely normal. Beverly and Geordi are standing	next to him. Crusher turns to Barclay.					BEVERLY				(to Barclay)			There was enough energy in that			flash to overload your optic			nerves. It knocked you			unconscious.					GEORDI			My VISOR must have filtered it			out.					BEVERLY			Exactly.				(to Barclay)			Well, there's no apparent retinal			damage and the cornea looks fine.			But I'm still waiting for the full			sero-amino readout. I'll call			you when it comes in.	Barclay takes this as a dismissal, and gets down off	the bed, joining Geordi. Beverly heads for another	part of Sickbay. Barclay thinks for a moment, then	hesitantly calls after her.					BARCLAY			You shouldn't have to... wait so			long for the results...	Beverly stops and turns back to him, puzzled.					BEVERLY			What do you mean?					BARCLAY			Couldn't you use a global mode			in your scanner... It would be			a lot faster.	She's a bit taken aback by the suggestion, and by who	it's coming from. So is Geordi.    STAR TREK: "The Nth Degree" - REV. 1/28/91 - ACT ONE    12.13   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			That's not possible.				(a smile)			These are human cells we're			talking about, not isolinear			circuits.				(kiddingly)			You'd better stick to engineering.	Barclay, still a bit sheepish about bringing it up,	thinks for a second.					BARCLAY			The cells have a... an			electromagnetic signature... just			like a circuit element does...			Conceptually, it should work...			with a few adjustments...	She's interrupted by the RED ALERT lights and klaxons	sound. Geordi quickly heads for the door, Barclay	follows. On the way out he looks back toward Beverly	over his shoulder.					BARCLAY				(continuing)			I could set it up for you if you'd			like...	HOLD a moment on Beverly as Geordi and Barclay	disappear out the door. Despite the Red Alert, she's	still curious about his suggestion.14   INT. BRIDGE	Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Ensign Anaya at their	positions.
