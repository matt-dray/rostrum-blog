So we have taken a			shuttle to investigate.5    INT. SHUTTLE - IN FLIGHT	On RIKER, TROI and DATA, being buffeted inside on an	instruments-only run, a rough-as-they-come flight.	Over this, the distress SIGNAL mournfully plays,	stronger.	A burst of nearby LIGHTNING brightens their faces.	The THUNDER following this sounds like the voice of	doom.					DATA			Shields are holding...					RIKER				(checking instruments)			Wind shear is incredible, Data...			keep an eye on the stabilizers...				(glances at Troi)			If it's anything like this on the			ground, I don't see how anyone			could survive on this moon for			long.					TROI			Maybe they've been living			underground.					RIKER				(off console)			Question is where?

BRIDGE	Picard at command.					PICARD			Go ahead.	No response for a beat, then in scratchy reception:					RIKER'S COMM VOICE			We've lost our thrusters...			attempting to compensate with			secondary boosters...	With a burst of CRACKLE, Riker's voice disappears.					WORF			Sir? The shuttle's impulse			generators have shut down...					PICARD			Commander? Can you hear me?7    INT. SHUTTLE	Riker and Co. struggle to keep their small, shaking	craft aloft.					PICARD'S COM VOICE				(completely fritzed)			Enterprise to shuttle, please			respond.					RIKER			Hold on!

I'm taking her in...	The craft hits the ground roughly... the crew tossed	violently from side to side... the LIGHTS FAIL and	we're consumed by darkness... and finally silence.8    EXT. MOON SURFACE - INSIDE FOG	CAMERA PANS through the murk, until we see the SHUTTLE.	It's battered, sitting deadly still. More THUNDER	booms, as LIGHTNING cracks. But no sign of life shows	from inside the fallen craft.      STAR TREK: "Power Play" - REV. 11/26/91 - ACT ONE      6.9    INT. BRIDGE	A flurry of activity.

I followed their			entry almost all the way in...			we can calculate the coordinates			from their angle of descent...10   EXT. MOON SURFACE	On the shuttle. The hatch blows off and Riker emerges,	holding his arm. Data and Troi follow, shook-up but	intact. FOG swirls all around them, as distant	thunderbolts brighten the scene: a BARREN LANDSCAPE	with charred rocks and terrain, as if a forest fire has	swept through the area. Dark and windy.					RIKER				(taps communicator)			Enterprise?	But no answer from above. Troi looks around, Data runs	a tricorder scan. Riker's in pain but trying to ignore	it.					DATA			It is unlikely, sir, that we will			be able to establish communication			with the ship, given the severe			electromagnetic interference...   131:[1,#b]      STAR TREK: "Power Play" - REV. 12/06/91 - ACT ONE      7.10   CONTINUED:					RIKER				(in pain)			Then we'll stay put right here			until the Enterprise finds us...				(looks around)			Data, run an inventory of what's			still usable inside the shuttle.					DATA			Yes sir.	Data moves to the shuttle door, looks back inside.					TROI			Your arm...					RIKER			Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's			broken...	Riker checks the terrain with a tricorder...					RIKER			The surface is composed of			nonporous rock... makes me			think it's even more unlikely			anyone could live here...	Troi nods thoughtfully, as something else catches her	attention, behind Riker. Data returns from the	shuttle.					DATA			There are no instruments left of			practical value that have not been			damaged by the impact of our			landing.					TROI				(points to horizon)			What is that?11   ANGLE (OPTICAL)	to include distant GLIMMERING lights, seen ghostly	through the fog and clouds.

TRANSPORTER ROOM	On O'Brien and Geordi at the controls...					GEORDI			We can't get a pattern lock on			the communicators because of the			E-M bursts, Captain.

TRANSPORTER ROOM	O'Brien touches the console, muting the transmission.					O'BRIEN				(to Geordi)			Sir, let me beam down with a			pattern enhancer...					GEORDI			Chief, there's no guarantee you			won't rematerialize in a million			pieces if your signal gets caught			up in that electromagnetic			whirlwind...					O'BRIEN			I can boost the confinement			beam.

MOON SURFACE (OPTICAL)	Riker rests, as Troi and Data survey the foggy area.	O'Brien MATERIALIZES between them and the shuttle.	Only to be greeted by more thunder and LIGHTNING.					RIKER			Glad you could join us.					O'BRIEN			Great spot for a picnic, sir.	He begins to unload the equipment pack... handing gear	to the others, they all know basically what to do...     STAR TREK: "Power Play" - REV. 11/26/91 - ACT ONE     10.17   CONTINUED: (2)					O'BRIEN			We need to distribute the enhancer			rods at seven meter legs... that			ought to do it...					RIKER			Storm front going to affect the			transport, Chief... ?					O'BRIEN			I'd really like to get us out of			here before it hits, Commander...			see, I'm supposed to be feeding			the baby lunch...

Thunder approaches.	Data and O'Brien spread out... Riker goes with Troi...19   ANGLE ON STORM (OPTICAL)	A spectacular system of LIGHTNING BOLTS explode, light	up the sky. Followed by rolling THUNDER, inside angry,	swirling CLOUDS. Within seconds, wind howling, thunder	crashing, the STORM overtakes our away team.					RIKER			Lunch time, O'Brien! Let's do			it!	O'Brien attempts to activate his rod but a moment later	-- FLASH! A LIGHTNING BOLT strikes the rod -- and blows	O'Brien away from it.     STAR TREK: "Power Play" - REV. 11/27/91 - ACT ONE     11.20thru	OMITTED2223   WIDE ANGLE (OPTICAL)	All of them, stunned by the concussion, on the ground	inside the rod triangle.

ANOTHER tries	to approach Riker but is repelled somehow...24   RIKER (OPTICAL)	Crawls up to O'Brien's enhancer rod, determined. And	reaches out for the enhancer rod, throws the final	switch.

SICKBAY	TIGHT on Troi, eyes closed, unconscious. WIDEN to	BEVERLY who scans Troi on a table with a medical	tricorder. A quiet moment goes by... Then without	warning, Troi's EYES JERK OPEN and she BOLTS UPRIGHT,	knocking aside equipment -- crying out in terror, as 	if awakened from a nightmare. Beverly's startled, and	grasps Troi by the arms to keep her from struggling.					BEVERLY			Easy, Deanna...					TROI			W-where... ?	Beverly calms her, as Troi nervously rubs her arms.	Troi keeps looking around, as if to reorient herself.					BEVERLY			You're back on the Enterprise...			Everything's okay now.					TROI			But my skin... It's tingling.					BEVERLY			You are experiencing some			afterimages from the			electromagnetic discharge. The			sensation will pass.

Worried, Troi looks back to Beverly.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			They're all fine, too. Now take			your time, Counselor, okay?			Doctor's orders.	Troi nods, eases back onto the bed.
