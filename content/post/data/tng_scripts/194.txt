SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship orbits a small, orange hued planet.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log, stardate 44741.9.			We have arrived at Tagus Three			where the Enterprise is to serve			as host of the Federation			Archeology Council's annual			symposium.2    INT. READY ROOM	PICARD, intensely studying his monitor screen.					PICARD (V.O.)			I look forward to giving			tomorrow's keynote address with			great anticipation.	The DOOR CHIME SOUNDS.					PICARD			Come.	TROI ENTERS. Picard barely glances up from the	monitor. Troi smiles at Picard's preoccupation.					TROI			I thought you'd want to know,			Captain, the Council members have			all been beamed aboard and			assigned quarters.					PICARD			Excellent.         STAR TREK: "Q Love" - REV. 2/1/91 - TEASER         2.2    CONTINUED:					TROI				(a hint)			It really is quite late, Captain.	Picard motions her over to the monitor.					PICARD			Tell me, Counselor, in regard			to my lecture, which do you			suppose would provide greater			clarity? A chronological			structure, or a division of each			excavation's findings into various			sociological, religious, and			environmental sub-groupings?					TROI			I thought you had already decided			on a chronological structure.					PICARD				(nodding; but not quite				 convinced)			Still, there is something to be			said for a more scientific			approach.					TROI			Captain, may I make a suggestion?					PICARD			By all means.	Troi finally has the Captain's complete attention.					TROI			Relax! You've written a brilliant			speech.					PICARD			It needs to be. Tomorrow I'll			be addressing some of the greatest			scientific minds in the			Federation. Switzer,			Klarc-Tarn-Droth, McFarland.			Giants in the field of Archeology.			Next to them I'm nothing but an			enthusiastic amateur.         STAR TREK: "Q Love" - REV. 2/5/91 - TEASER         3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					TROI			I doubt they think of you as an			amateur... not when it comes to			the ruins of Tagus Three.					PICARD				(modestly)			Well, I have done my homework...			I've examined the findings of			every archaeological expedition			conducted on the planet's			surface...					TROI			It's unfortunate the Taguans no			longer allow outsiders to visit			the ruins.					PICARD				(wistful)			Indeed. Especially since we still			know so little about their			origin...	He gestures toward the monitor.					PICARD			Hopefully, I've been able to			construct some intriguing theories			of my own.					TROI			I'm sure the council members will			agree that you have.					PICARD				(smiling)			Your support is appreciated,			Deanna.	Picard stands.					PICARD			Screen off.	CU screen as it goes blank.         STAR TREK: "Q Love" - REV. 2/5/91 - TEASER         4.3    INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS	The door OPENS. Picard ENTERS looking somewhat	fatigued.	The first thing he notices -- is a Horga'hn sitting	on his desk. Picard looks at it, curious... where the	hell did this thing come from? Then...					VASH (O.S.)			Bring back any memories?	Picard turns to see VASH stepping out of the shadows	near the door. For a moment he's taken completely	off-guard.					PICARD			Vash? How did you get in here?	She smiles... and moves closer.					VASH			I came in through the window.	Picard barely has the chance to regain his aplomb when	she snakes an arm around him and they kiss. It's going	to last awhile.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   STAR TREK: "Q Love" - REV. 2/5/91 - ACT ONE         5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:4    INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS - MORNING	Vash, wearing the same outfit from the night before,	and Picard, in his dress uniform, sit at a table eating	a brekfast of rolls and jam. Though there is still a	warm afterglow from the evening's activities, Picard is	slightly ill at ease about playing host to Vash aboard	the Enterprise.					PICARD			I had no idea you were a member			of the Archaeology Council.	Vash only smiles.					PICARD			You are a member?				(a beat)			Aren't you.         STAR TREK: "Q Love" - REV. 2/1/91 - ACT ONE         6.4    CONTINUED:					VASH				(smiling)			More or less.					PICARD			Why have you come to Tagus Three?					VASH			To see you, of course.					PICARD			Is that the only reason?					VASH			Isn't it enough?	She's moves closer to him. It's an intimate moment.					PICARD				(smiling)			I wish I could believe you?					VASH				(smiling right back)			I'd be disappointed if you did.				(a beat)			I really have missed you,			Jean-Luc.	But before they can act on a mutual impulse the DOOR	CHIMES. Picard waits until Vash steps away before	answering.					PICARD			Come.	BEVERLY strides in.					BEVERLY			I'm sorry I'm late...				(noticing Vash)			Oh, excuse me. I didn't know you			had company.					PICARD			That's quite all right, Doctor.			Beverly Crusher allow me to			introduce Vash. A friend of mine			with the Archeology Council.	The two women exchange greetings.           STAR TREK: "Q Love" - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE           7.4    CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY				(to Vash)			I didn't mean to interrupt. The			Captain and I often share morning			tea.					VASH			Yes, Jean-Luc has told me all			about you.					BEVERLY			Really? When was that?					VASH			On Risa. Where we met.	Beverly is finding this all very interesting.					BEVERLY			I see.				(to Picard)			That must have been during your			vacation last year.					PICARD				(giving nothing away)			So it was.					BEVERLY				(to Vash)			I'm surprised he never mentioned			you.					VASH			So am I.	She shoots Picard a look, but no explanation is	forthcoming.					VASH			Are you busy, Doctor?					BEVERLY			Not at the moment.					VASH			I was wondering, I would love to			see some more of this marvelous			ship...           STAR TREK: "Q Love" - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE           8.4    CONTINUED: (3)					BEVERLY			I'd be delighted to show it to			you. If that's alright with you,			Jean-Luc.					PICARD			Of course.	But he doesn't seem thrilled at the prospect. As Vash	passes him on the way out...					VASH				(sotto voce)			Don't worry, I promise to behave			myself.	Picard does not look reassured.5    INT. TEN FORWARD	The lounge is only lightly populated at the moment.	Riker is seated alone having a drink.	Beverly and Vash ENTER.					BEVERLY			And this is Ten Forward, where			the Council's welcoming reception			is to be held this afternoon.					VASH				(liking what she sees)			I couldn't think of a better			location.				(a beat)			Tell me, does Jean-Luc come here			often?					BEVERLY			No, not often.					VASH			I didn't think so.					BEVERLY			The Captain is a very private man.           STAR TREK: "Q Love" - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE           9.5    CONTINUED:					VASH			He certainly acted that way when			we first met.				(smiling)			But I managed to loosen him up.	Beverly would definitely like to learn more about this	woman.					BEVERLY			Would you like something to drink?					VASH			Please.	Beverly walks over to the bar. Vash checks out the	view from the window as Riker APPROACHES.					RIKER			Eternity never looked so lovely.					VASH			Excuse me?					RIKER			I was referring to the view.			Eternity never looked so lovely.	Vash gives him a shrewd appraisal.					VASH			You must be Commander Riker.					RIKER				(surprised)			I'm afraid you have me at a			disadvantage.					VASH			I didn't mean to interrupt. I			believe you were about to tell			me that my eyes are as mysterious			as the stars.	Riker is intrigued. How the hell did she know?					RIKER				(thinks he's figured				 it out)			You're a Betazoid.          STAR TREK: "Q Love" - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE          10.5    CONTINUED: (2)					VASH			Not at all. It's just that			Jean-Luc does quite a good			imitation of you.					RIKER			He does?	Beverly comes back with the drinks.					BEVERLY			I see you two have met.					RIKER			Not exactly.					BEVERLY			Vash is a member of the Archeology			Council. And a friend of the			Captain.					RIKER			So I've gathered.					BEVERLY			They met during his visit to Risa.					RIKER			On Risa?				(amused)			That must have been a better			vacation than he let on.					VASH			You mean he never mentioned me			to you either?					RIKER			Believe me, if he had, I would			have remembered.					VASH				(a bit frustrated)			You'd think he'd have told someone			about me.					COMPUTER VOICE			Doctor Crusher, please report to			Sickbay.          STAR TREK: "Q Love" - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE          11.5    CONTINUED: (3)					BEVERLY			On my way.				(to Vash)			I'm afraid I won't be able to			finish up our tour.				(a beat)			Perhaps Commander Riker could fill			in for me.					RIKER			It would be my pleasure.	Beverly leaves. Riker and Vash head for the door.					VASH			So you're the one who asked			Jean-Luc to buy the Horga'han.					RIKER			That was me.					VASH			Tell me Commander, do you collect			sexual fertility symbols?					RIKER			I wouldn't call it a very large			collection.	And they're out the door.6    INT. BRIDGE	DATA and GEORDI at Science Station, WORF at Tactical.	N.D.'s elsewhere.	Riker and Vash EXIT the aft turbolift.					RIKER			And that brings us to the Main			Bridge, the Command center of the			Enterprise, and the end of our			tour.	He brings her over to the Science Station.					RIKER			Vash, I'd like you to meet			Commander La Forge and Commander			Data...          STAR TREK: "Q Love" - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE          12.6    CONTINUED:	An exchange of greetings. Riker gestures over to Worf	who looks on with disapproval.					RIKER			And this is Lieutenant Worf.				(noticing Worf's scowl)			Something wrong, Lieutenant?					WORF			Sir, I was not informed that			Council Members had been granted			bridge clearance.					RIKER			I think we can make an exception			in this case, Mister Worf. Vash			is the Captain's guest.	Interested glances all around. Worf is somewhat at	a loss for what to say.					WORF				(finally)			Welcome aboard.	Riker leads Vash over to the Command area.					VASH			Is this where Jean-Luc sits?					RIKER				(pointing it out)			That's the big chair.	To everyone's surprise she sits down in it. It	provides a definite sense of power.					VASH			I can see where being a starship			Captain does have its rewards.					PICARD (V.O.)			I'm glad you approve.	All eyes turn to Picard who has just exited the Ready	Room. Vash stands.          STAR TREK: "Q Love" - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE          13.6    CONTINUED: (2)					VASH			Jean-Luc. Commander Riker was			just showing me the bridge.	Picard looks at Riker.					RIKER			Doctor Crusher was called to			Sickbay.	Picard nods. An awkward beat of silence.					PICARD			So, did you enjoy your tour?					VASH			Very much.					PICARD			Good.	Another awkward moment.					VASH			I guess I'll head back to my room			now and get ready for the			reception.					PICARD			By all means.				(a beat)			Well, I suppose I'll see you then.					VASH			I look forward to it.	She turns and makes the long walk back up the ramp to	the turbolift.					RIKER				(watching her go)			Fascinating woman.	No comment, from Picard.7    ANGLE ON	Data and Geordi. Geordi has also watched Vash EXIT	the bridge.	As the turbolift doors close he breaks into a grin.          STAR TREK: "Q Love" - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE          14.7    CONTINUED:					DATA			You find something humorous,			Geordi?					GEORDI			Didn't you notice how ill-at-ease			the Captain seemed around Vash?					DATA			Yes. However I see nothing			amusing in his hostility toward			her.					GEORDI			That wasn't hostility, Data.				(off Data's look)			He likes her.				(a beat)			A lot.	Still smiling, Geordi turns back to the science	monitor. A puzzled Data is left pondering the	intricacies of human relationships.8    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship maintains standard orbit.9    INT. TEN FORWARD	The reception. COUNCIL MEMBERS mingle with the crew.	A rather informal time is being had by all.10   NEW ANGLE	Vash has cornered TROI over by a buffet table.         STAR TREK: "Q Love" - REV. 2/5/91 - ACT ONE 15-15A.           10   CONTINUED:					VASH			I don't understand, I thought			being ship's counselor meant the			Captain confided in you.					TROI			He does. When he feels it's			necessary.					VASH			And he never spoke to you about			me?					TROI			Not that I can recall.					VASH			Not even a hint?					TROI			You must understand, the Captain			is a very...					TROI & VASH				(together)			Private man.					VASH			I know...	She spots Picard who is deep in discussion with a	Vulcan Council Member.					VASH			Will you excuse me?					TROI			Certainly.	Vash walks off.11   NEW ANGLE	Vash passes by Worf, Geordi, Beverly and Data.					WORF				(still watching Vash)			Nice legs.				(off Geordi's look)			For a human.          STAR TREK: "Q Love" - 1/31/91 - ACT ONE          16.12   NEW ANGLE	Picard and the Vulcan.					PICARD			I agree, the Vulcan excavations			on Tagus Three were extensive.			Unfortunately, they were confined			to the northeastern part of the			city.	Vash appears at his elbow.					VASH			Jean-Luc, we need to talk.	One look and Picard knows she means it.					PICARD				(to the Vulcan)			Pardon me.	He and Vash move to a private spot.					PICARD			The reception seems to be a			success.					VASH			Forget the reception for a moment.			How come you've never mentioned			me to your friends?					PICARD			What would you have me tell them?					VASH			Maybe that we met, for one thing.			That we had an adventure together.			Some fun...					PICARD			I'm afraid that wasn't possible.					VASH			Why not?					PICARD			It would have			been... inappropriate.					VASH			I wasn't expecting you to go into			any intimate details.        STAR TREK: "Q Love" - REV. 2/5/91 - ACT ONE        17.12   CONTINUED:					PICARD			A Captain does not share his			personal feelings with his crew.					VASH			Is that a Starfleet regulation?			Or did you make that one up			yourself?					PICARD			I'm sorry if you're upset.					VASH			And I'm sorry if my being here			embarrasses you.	And with that she turns and walks away.	HOLD ON a perplexed Captain Picard.13   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Riker at command. N.D.'s at Conn and Ops.	Picard ENTERS from the forward turbolift.					RIKER			How was the reception?					PICARD				(brusque)			Splendid.	He EXITS into the Ready Room.14   INT.

It's a pleasure to see you			again old friend."					PICARD			We are not friends.					Q			You wound me, mon Capitain.	Q snaps his fingers and now it's Picard who sits at his	desk and Q who stands before him.					Q			There, perhaps now your manners			will show some improvement.					PICARD			What brings you here, Q?
