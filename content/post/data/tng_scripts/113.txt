WAITING ROOM/OFFICE - NIGHT	Hill's SECRETARY, a plain blond with a bubbly	personality, is just on her way to lunch. She looks	Picard up and down with bemusement...					SECRETARY			Very funny, Dix. What'd you do,			lose another bet?					PICARD			I don't understand --					SECRETARY			The bellboy suit. Are you			moonlighting at the Fremont?	Picard looks down at his uniform.					PICARD			The uniform. Totally			inappropriate. Why didn't I			change?	The Secretary hurriedly pulls on her coat and gloves.					SECRETARY			Mister Leech called twice, and			there's a lady named Bradley			waiting in your office. Nice			legs.	In a flash, she's halfway out the door.					SECRETARY				(continuing)			Gotta hot date with my fella.			I'll see ya in the morning.	She gives Picard's uniform one last look -- shaking her	head as she SHUTS THE DOOR BEHIND HER.	Picard is left alone in the waiting room. He's	thrilled by the detail in this, the somewhat rundown	workplace of the fictional detective DIXON HILL.	A RUSTLING NOISE in the adjoining room reminds Picard	that someone's waiting for him.	As he pushes the door open, the first thing he sees are	the great pair of legs his secretary mentioned.      STAR TREK: "The Big Good-bye" - 10/14/87 - TEASER      5.9    CONTINUED:	MRS. JESSICA BRADLEY rises to greet the detective she's	come to see. She's a wealthy woman in her late	twenties who radiates a seductive sensuality. The rest	of her body matches her legs.	She can't help but wonder at the sight of Picard's	maroon and black uniform...					PICARD			Uh, I lost a bet.					JESSICA			Oh well... At least you're ready			for Halloween.					PICARD			Halloween?	She BLOWS OUT some cigarette SMOKE and looks out at	the city, concerned, then turns to him.					JESSICA			I need your help, Mister Hill.				(turning to face him)			Someone is trying to kill me.							MUSICAL STING, FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "The Big Good-bye" - 10/14/87 - ACT ONE     6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:10   EXT.

The			computer characters accept me as			Dixon Hill, even to the extent that			Jessica Bradley, a millionaire's			wife from the wrong side of the			tracks, wants to hire me.					JESSICA			I'm not sure who wants me dead.			My husband... My stepdaughter...					PICARD			Or a lover, perhaps?	Mrs. Bradley shoots Picard a sly look.					JESSICA			Perhaps.				(pause)			Perhaps Cyrus Redblock.     STAR TREK: "The Big Good-bye" - 10/14/87 - ACT ONE     7.12   CONTINUED:	She seems to wait for a reaction from Picard, but it	never comes.					JESSICA				(continuing)			I need you to find out. Name			your fee.					PICARD			Twenty dollars a day. Plus			expenses.					JESSICA			Agreed.	She gets up, as though preparing to leave...					PICARD			I haven't said yes yet.					JESSICA				(cool smile)			Oh you'll say yes.	She moves closer and kisses him tenderly. Picard is	surprised by the warmth of her lips.					JESSICA				(continuing; whispering)			If it's Redblock, he must think			I've got what he's looking for.			But believe me, I don't.					PICARD			I'll take your word for it.	Jessica hands him money. WE SEE a crisp one-hundred	dollar bill.					JESSICA			Here's a C-note in advance.			Consider it a retainer...				(day as she touches				 his uniform)			... and next time, could you wear			a suit?	She takes one of Hill's business cards from his desk	and then EXITS, as the captain watches her leave the	office.     STAR TREK: "The Big Good-bye" - 10/14/87 - ACT ONE     8.12   CONTINUED: (2)	Now alone, it's clear he's enthralled by this imaginary	world. He opens the window and looks down on the	street -- WE CAN HEAR THE SOUNDS OF MOVING TRAFFIC AND	HONKING HORNS.					PICARD				(to himself, soft)			Remarkable.	Picard leaves the window. He touches the insignia	on his chest, and a QUICK HIGH PITCHED SOUND CAN BE	HEARD through the closet door in his office. (Picard	knows that this sound indicates another Holodeck	Exit.)	He opens the closet door and finds the portal. Just	before he steps through, there's a knock on the waiting	room door.13   PICARD'S POV - THE DOOR	The SILHOUETTE of a small man CAN BE SEEN though the	pane. He knocks again, delicately; his knuckles	sounding like a woodpecker rapping on a hollow tree.					PICARD				(calling out)			You'll have to call again. I'm			just leaving. I'm not dressed			properly. I'll be back.	And he leaves -- WALKING THROUGH the EXIT. The office	door OPENS. Leech ENTERS. Mister Leech has short	curly hair and big bulging eyes. He wears a bow tie	and speaks with a strange nasally tone that betrays	a Middle-Eastern background.					LEECH			Not yet, please --	Leech looks around at the empty office, confusion on	his face.13A  INT. HOLODECK CORRIDOR BY SIDE EXIT	Picard walks down the corridor and turns the corner	to the main entrance to the Holodeck.14   OMITTED     STAR TREK: "The Big Good-bye" - 10/14/87 - ACT ONE     9.15   INT.

Proceed			with the briefing, Number One.	Riker has been enjoying the discussion, but he quickly	switches gears.					RIKER			This is primarily a necessary			diplomatic mission. The Jaradan			are strategically important to the			Federation. Previous attempts			failed because they are so easily			irritated. A slip in the			pronunciation of the greeting			caused a twenty-year rift in the			relation.					DATA			Therefore the captain must recite			the entire greeting without any			mistakes.					GEORDI				(amused)			Simple as that.					DATA				(straightforward)			Yes. If, on the other hand, the			captain makes even the slightest			error --					TASHA			-- The captain is well aware of			the gravity of the situation,			Commander.					DATA			I have located a history tape			of the last Federation starship			to come in contact with the			Jarada.

He was just a			twentieth-century Sherlock			Holmes.					DATA			But his modus operandi is quite			dissimilar.
