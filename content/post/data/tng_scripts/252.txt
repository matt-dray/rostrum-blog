DATA'S QUARTERS/HOLODECK (OPTICAL)	Seated around the poker table clockwise are DATA,	STEPHEN HAWKING, ALBERT EINSTEIN, and ISAAC NEWTON.	Everyone has chips and cards in front of them -- a	small device is holding Hawking's cards for him.	Hawking is telling the last few lines of a very	esoteric joke.					HAWKING			... but then I said, "In that			frame of reference, the perihelion			of Mercury would have precessed in			the opposite direction."	Einstein laughs uproariously, Data looks amused, and	Newton looks puzzled.					EINSTEIN			That is a great story!					DATA			Quite amusing, Professor Hawking.				(to Newton)			You see, Sir Isaac, the joke			depends on an understanding of the			relativistic curvature of spacetime.			If two non-inertial			reference frames are in relative			motion--					NEWTON				(irritated)			Do not patronize me, sir! I			invented physics. The day that			apple fell on my head was the most			momentous day in the history of			science.					HAWKING			Not the apple story again.					DATA			That story is generally considered			to be apocryphal.          STAR TREK: "Descent" - 04/12/93 - TEASER          2.1    CONTINUED:					NEWTON				(outraged)			What? How dare you?					EINSTEIN			Perhaps we should return to the			game.				(thinks, to Hawking)			Let's see, you raised Mister Data			four, which means the bet is seven			to me.					NEWTON			The bet is ten! Can't you do			simple arithmetic?	Einstein pushes out the correct number of chips.	Newton matches the bet.					NEWTON				(grumbling)			I don't even know why I'm here in			the first place. What's the point			of playing this ridiculous game?					DATA				(matches the bet)			I am in. When I play poker with			my shipmates, I often find that it			is a useful forum for exploring			different facets of humanity. I			was curious to see how three of			history's greatest minds would			interact in this setting. So far			it has proved most illuminating.	Einstein looks down at his own immense stack of chips.					EINSTEIN			And profitable.					NEWTON			Can we get this over with, please?				(to Hawking)			It's your bet.					HAWKING			I raise fifty.	Data pushes out some chips for him. Newton reacts and	throws his cards down in disgust.					NEWTON			Blast! I fold.          STAR TREK: "Descent" - 04/12/93 - TEASER          3.1    CONTINUED: (2)	Data also puts down his cards and folds, but Einstein	holds firm.					EINSTEIN				(to Hawking)			The uncertainty principle will not			help you now, Stephen. All the			quantum fluctuations in the			universe won't change the cards in			your hand. I call. You are			bluffing and you will lose.					HAWKING			Wrong again, Albert.	Hawking's card holder flips over his cards.2    INSERT - HAWKING'S CARDS	he has four SEVENS.3    RESUME SCENE	As they all react.

Data ENTERS from the forward Turbolift and	moves to Ops. The ship is on Red Alert.					RIKER				(to Picard)			We've received a distress call			from the Ohniaka Three Outpost.			They said they were under attack.					PICARD				(puzzled)			Ohniaka Three... there's no			strategic value to that outpost.			Were they able to identify the			attackers?					RIKER			No, sir. And we haven't been able			to raise them since the initial			call.					WORF			We are nearing the Ohniaka system,			Captain.	Picard and Riker move toward the Command area.					PICARD				(to Con)			Bring us out of warp, Ensign.					WORF			Sensors detect one ship orbiting			the third planet... its			configuration does not match			anything in our records.					RIKER			Stand-by phasers and photon			torpedoes.					PICARD			Hail them, Mister Worf.					WORF				(works)			No response.					PICARD			Put them onscreen.        STAR TREK: "Descent" - REV. 04/13/93 - TEASER        5.6    INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	The screen shows an ALIEN VESSEL in orbit around a	planet. The ship is unlike any other we've ever seen.	It has very little markings or decoration, but it is	clearly menacing.					DATA			It does not appear to be attacking			the outpost.					RIKER			They might have attacked before we			got here.					PICARD			Or they might simply be another			victim.				(beat, to Data)			What about the outpost on the			surface?					DATA				(works)			There is a great deal of			electromagnetic interference... I			am unable to determine whether			there are any lifeforms present.	Riker looks to Picard, who thinks for a moment, then	nods.

Worf -- you, and			Corelki start searching the north			wing, we'll take the south.					WORF			Aye, sir.	Worf and the N.D. Guard EXIT the room.

OUTPOST (OPTICAL)	Riker and Data have taken cover behind some consoles	and they are trading PHASER SHOTS with the Borg. These	Borg are not acting like the calm, neutral automatons	that we've become used to seeing. They are quickfooted,	cunning, and ferocious. Their faces are	twisted into expressions of fury and hatred... and they	take care to hide behind objects to avoid being shot --	in short, they are behaving like individuals instead of	mindless worker ants.       STAR TREK: "Descent" - REV. 04/14/93 - ACT ONE       9.12   CONTINUED:	One of the Borg makes a move toward them, but Riker	FIRES at him and the Borg goes down.	Another Borg -- BORG #1 -- looks at the body of the	fallen Borg from behind a console.

Data looks confused... the rage and violence we	saw only a moment ago is now gone and he seems puzzled	by what's happened.                                             CUT TO:20   INT.
