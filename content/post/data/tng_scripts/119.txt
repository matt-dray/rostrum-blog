DECK 21 FORWARD LOUNGE	A large cake with seventeen BURNING candles is in the	center of the table. It says "HAPPY 16TH BIRTHDAY" and	"GOOD LUCK, WESLEY." The whole BRIDGE CREW waits	around the table as Wesley ENTERS with Beverly. He's	touched, embarrassed and -- wants to get out of there.					RIKER			Happy Birthday, Wesley!	Everyone ECHOES THE SENTIMENT.					WESLEY			Thanks everybody.

Humans are			fascinating. They celebrate the			passage of time with such joy			until a certain age, and then it			becomes a topic of some			discomfort.

Do you know?					DATA			I have no age.	Data stares at Beverly, who's standing next to Picard.					BEVERLY			Is there something wrong?					DATA			No. I am simply trying to			understand the celebration of			aging. And how old were you when			Wesley was born, Doctor?	Beverly shoves her piece of cake at him.					BEVERLY			Have some cake, Data.	She LEAVES him standing there with Picard.					DATA			I do not understand, sir.

He looks around the room uncomfortably.	There's an impressive array of DEVICES, including a	special SENSOR UNIT. He reaches down to inspect it,	but puts it back guiltily as OLIANA MIRREN ENTERS.	She's a gorgeous eighteen-year-old human, a red-head	with sparkle and probably a temper.					OLIANA			What is it?					WESLEY			What?					OLIANA			The unit you just put down. Don't			worry. I won't tell anybody.					WESLEY			Oh. It's a flux coordinating			sensor.	Oliana puts out her hand. Wesley takes it and	absentmindedly holds it. He's mesmerized by her.					OLIANA			I'm Oliana Mirren, one of the			other finalists. You must be			Wesley Crusher.	She gently removes her hand from his.					WESLEY			Yeah! You know me?					OLIANA			I heard there was a very smart,			very young man who'd be tough			competition.      STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT ONE      11.7    CONTINUED:					WESLEY				(embarrassed)			Well, you wouldn't be here if...					OLIANA			...

You're lucky - you've had			practical experience on the			Enterprise.	As she speaks, the door OPENS and T'SHANIK, a dark	young Vulcan woman, who looks as if she's surprised	anyone else bothered to show up, ENTERS with MORDOCK,	a powerfully built alien with a special suit using	circulating gas tubes. Mordock hangs back a little,	quietly.					T'SHANIK			Oliana.				(to Wesley)			T'Shanik of Vulcana Regar.					WESLEY			Wesley Crusher, from the			Enterprise.					T'SHANIK			You don't look as if you meet the			age requirements.					WESLEY			Uh, I'll be sixteen next month.					OLIANA				(pats him on the				 shoulder)			Happy birthday.

Except, perhaps,			a casual familiarity among the			bridge crew, but... mostly that			comes from a sense of teamwork.				(beat)			I'm sorry, sir. I did my best.					QUINN			Quite. You're dismissed,			Commander.					REMMICK			Yes, sir.	He gets up to leave, and pauses at the door.					REMMICK				(continuing)			Captain Picard, my tour in the			Inspector General's office will			be up in six months. When I'm			finished, this is where I'd like			to serve, sir.	He nods and LEAVES. Picard looks at Quinn.					QUINN			Don't judge the young man too			harshly. He's a good officer.					PICARD			It's not him I'm judging.      STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FOUR      44.49   CONTINUED: (2)					QUINN			Don't judge me too harshly,			either. Not until I'm finished.			We had to be very sure about you.				(beat)			Some time ago, a few of us in			Starfleet Command became			suspicious of problems within			the Federation.					PICARD			What kind of problems?					QUINN			Something or someone is trying			to destroy the fabric of all we've			built over the last two hundred			years.					PICARD			What's your evidence?					QUINN			I can't go into that. Too many			other people are involved. But			if we're right, this is the most			critical time in the history of			the Federation.					PICARD			What do you want from me?					QUINN			I don't know if the threat is			coming from within or from the			outside. I need people I can trust			in strong positions throughout			the Federation.					PICARD			You have my complete support.			You know that.					QUINN			Not enough. I want to promote			you to admiral, Jean-Luc. I want			you to take over as Commandant			of Starfleet Academy.					PICARD			The Academy?      STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FOUR      45.49   CONTINUED: (3)					QUINN			Yes. I need you close.					PICARD			Then there was never a problem			with the Enterprise.					QUINN			No. I had to be sure you hadn't			been co-opted.					PICARD			Greg, the real issue is politics.			I'm no good at politics. Surely			there are others more suited.	Picard isn't sure how to take all of this.					QUINN			I sense you're doubtful about			this. All right. Suppose it's			the rambling paranoia of an old			man. Even if I am wrong, and I			hope I am, you're still the best			man for the job.					PICARD			I appreciate the value of what			you're offering. It's not			something I can decide quickly.	Quinn pushes him.					QUINN			I need your answer soon, Captain.					PICARD			All right.

RELVA 7 (OPTICAL)	ESTABLISHING.51   INT. RELVA 7 - CORRIDOR	Wesley sits nervously waiting outside the Testing Room.	He closes his eyes and tries to do breathing exercises	to keep himself calm. Chang COMES OUT of the Testing	Room.					CHANG			Mister Mordock will be finished with			his Psych Test momentarily.	Wesley watches the door, waiting. It slides OPEN, but	no one is there. Then... Mordock EMERGES, badly	shaken, his face covered with sweat. He looks down	at his hands.					WESLEY			Mordock? Are you... all right?	Mordock tries not to scare Wesley.					MORDOCK			I will be...					CHANG			Mister Crusher... you're next. Good			luck.	Chang gestures for Wesley to enter. Wesley hesitates,	then STEPS THROUGH. The door slides SHUT behind him.52   OMITTED53   INT. RELVA 7 - TESTING ROOM	An ordinary room. White walls, two or three chairs, no	windows. Wesley looks around for some guidance as to	the next step. He waits a beat, then looks around and	decides to sit down. Still nothing.      STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE      47.53   CONTINUED:					WESLEY			Hello?	He gets up and starts to pace.					WESLEY				(continuing)			I'm here. I'm, uh, ready.	Nothing. He sits down again.					WESLEY				(continuing; muttering)			Maybe they forgot.	Wesley jumps up again and resumes pacing.					WESLEY				(continuing)			Breathe. Gotta remember to			breathe.	He's startled by something -- a sound, a sense of	something wrong. He becomes alert, checking out the	room. He takes another deep breath, then realizes he	hears something in the distance -- MUFFLED THUD. He	moves towards the door he entered. He listens intently	near the door, and hears a LOUDER NOISE. Wesley opens	the door manually and ENTERS the corridor.54   INT. RELVA 7 - LONG CORRIDOR	Several more O.S. EXPLOSIONS. Wesley runs towards its	source. He reaches a door and hears ALARMS RINGING	and another EXPLOSION. The door says: "ENVIRONMENTAL	MAINTENANCE LABORATORY." He runs down the empty	corridor and YELLS.					WESLEY			Somebody help! Something's wrong			in the lab!	There is no response. Then he hears:					TECHNICIAN #1 (V.O.)			Help! We're trapped. Help!			We're gonna die.					COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)			Evacuate immediately. Sixty-five			seconds to life-support seal-off.	Wesley presses the wallplate and the door GLIDES OPEN.      STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE      48.55   INT. RELVA 7 - ENVIRONMENTAL LAB	Wesley ENTERS cautiously. The door CLOSES behind him.	WIND HOWLS through the room, which has been partially	trashed by the explosions. It's FREEZING. A large	pipe has fractured, allowing fumes of liquid hydrogen	(or another gas) and a vortex of wind to act as a barrier	between Wesley and the TWO TECHNICIANS.	TECHNICIAN #1 is cowered in a corner, uninjured,	YELLING, on the other side of the wind tunnel. His	pathway out is partially blocked by debris, so he must	cross the vortex to get to the door.	TECHNICIAN #2, is trapped, under a piece of equipment	on the far side of the vortex, not far from Technician	#1.	Wesley hesitates, then makes his way ACROSS the HOWLING	WIND to the injured Technician. The WIND and COLD	continue to batter the two of them.					COMPUTER VOICE			Evacuate immediately. Forty-five			seconds to life-support seal-off.	Wesley tries to move the equipment off the trapped	man.					WESLEY				(to Technician #1)			Help me move this!	The Technician remains cowered in the corner, shaking	his head. Wesley keeps pushing the equipment.					WESLEY				(continuing)			You have to help me!					TECHNICIAN #1			I can't! It's too late. We're			going to die! The liquid			hydrogen's gonna blow!					TECHNICIAN #2			Please don't leave me! The			shut-off valve ruptured. If we			don't get out of here fast,			they'll seal us off to contain			the explosion!      STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE      49.55   CONTINUED:					COMPUTER VOICE			Evacuate immediately. Twenty-five			seconds to seal-off.	Wesley finds something to use as a lever. The	equipment begins to move slightly. Beads of sweat pour	off Wesley's face as he makes a Herculean last effort.	Technician #2's leg is free. Wesley drags him out.	He turns to Technician #1.					WESLEY			Come on!					TECHNICIAN #1			There's no way out! I can't move			through that!					WESLEY			You have to. I can't carry you			both! You can walk. Come on.					COMPUTER VOICE			Evacuate immediately. Five			seconds to seal-off.	Technician #1 remains terrified in the corner. Wesley	hesitates a moment, then half-carries, half-drags	Technician #2 through the vortex towards the exit.	He looks back:					WESLEY			I'm sorry.	Wesley pulls Technician #2 THROUGH THE DOOR to the	corridor.56   INT. RELVA 7 - CORRIDOR	Wesley pulls Technician #2 THROUGH THE DOOR INTO the	corridor. The door SNAPS SHUT behind him. Chang is	standing there, waiting. Wesley's heart is pounding,	his adrenaline up.					WESLEY			Officer Chang! There's been an...					CHANG			It's all right, Wesley.	The "injured" Technician gets up, brushes himself off,	and shakes Wesley's hand. Wesley's shocked.          STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE          50.56   CONTINUED:					TECHNICIAN #2			Thanks.	He WALKS down the corridor, leaving Wesley with Chang.	Wesley's still pale and breathing shallowly, when	Technician #1 EXITS the Lab, nods to them both, and	FOLLOWS the other Technician.					CHANG.			Excellent performance, Mister			Crusher.					WESLEY			Performance?!... That was the test.					CHANG			Yes.					WESLEY			But a man died!					CHANG			Theoretically, yes. You had to			make a choice. And you did.			There's no right or wrong about			it. Your greatest fear has been			that you couldn't make that			decision.	Wesley just looks at him, and nods his head slowly.					WESLEY			Because of my father? Because			Cap... someone made that choice			and my father died.	Chang smiles and pats Wesley on the shoulder.57   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	orbiting Relva 7.58   INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM	Picard is standing as Riker ENTERS.					RIKER			Sir?          STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE          51.58   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Yes, Number One?					RIKER			Mister Remmick has left the ship.					PICARD			Yes. He found nothing wrong on			the Enterprise. You may inform			the crew that Admiral Quinn is			most impressed.					RIKER			Thank you. They'll be pleased...			Can you explain now what he was			after?					PICARD			They were after me, Number One.			They want me to take over as			Commandant of Starfleet Academy.					RIKER			Congratulations! What a wonderful			choice, sir! You'll be able to			shape the minds of the future			leaders of Starfleet.	He looks at Picard, realizes his ambivalence.					RIKER				(continuing)			You haven't decided what you're			going to do.					PICARD			Yes I have, Number One. I'm			going for a walk.59   EXT. RELVA 7 (OPTICAL)	ESTABLISHING.60   INT. RELVA 7 - CLASSROOM	Chang is at the front of the class as the four students	await his decision. Wesley, Oliana and Mordock are	nervous, T'Shanik impassive.          STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE          52.60   CONTINUED:					CHANG			I'm proud of all of you. You've			done a superb job. Each of you			would make a fine Starfleet			officer. It's unfair that only			one candidate from Relva will			attend the Academy this year --			and a loss to the Federation if			the rest of you do not return to			test again... Mister Mordock will			be the candidate. His results			were slightly higher than Mister			Crusher's. Congratulations, Mister			Mordock. You are the first			Benzite in Starfleet.	Wesley slumps in his seat. Mordock looks at all of	them, then turns to Chang.					MORDOCK			Thank you, sir, but it's not			right. It shouldn't be me.			Wesley lost points because he			helped me. He shouldn't be			punished for his generosity.					CHANG			He wasn't. He lost time, but			it wasn't only that...			Candidates, thank you and good			luck.	They all stand as Chang EXITS.					MORDOCK			I am sorry, Wesley.					WESLEY			It's okay. You deserved to win.			Besides, you would've done the			same thing for me.	They all look questioningly at Mordock, who hesitates.	Then he looks at his comrades:					MORDOCK			Yes. I believe I would.	T'Shanik APPROACHES Mordock.					T'SHANIK			Congratulations.          STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE          53.60   CONTINUED: (2)	She nods to the others and LEAVES the room as Oliana	and Wesley shake hands with Mordock.					OLIANA			Well, personally, I hate losing.			So you'd better be ready next			year, Wesley. I won't be easy			to beat.	Wesley smiles at the thought of seeing her again,	whatever the circumstances.61   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	ESTABLISHING.62thru	OMITTED6364   INT. CORRIDOR	Picard strides down the corridor when he runs into	Jake Kurland, who takes one look at him and would like	to be anywhere else on the Enterprise.					PICARD			Mister Kurland!					JAKE			Yes, sir.	Picard is uncomfortable around him.					PICARD			Are you... feeling better?					JAKE			Yes, sir... I'm sorry I damaged			the shuttle. But Mister Riker says			I can work on fixing it as part			of my "discipline" training.					PICARD			Good idea. I hope you learned			that running away doesn't solve			anything, young man.					JAKE			Yes, sir. I'm sorry I messed up.          STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE          54.64   CONTINUED:					PICARD			I know. But you did keep your			wits about you out there... don't			forget that.					JAKE			No, sir. And... thank you for			saving my life.	Now Picard would rather be anywhere else on the ship.					PICARD			You're welcome.	He turns and WALKS BACK the other way.64A  OMITTED65   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Wesley stands there, alone and melancholy, staring at	the starfield outside the window. Picard ENTERS.					PICARD			Mister Crusher? Why aren't you in			your dress uniform for Admiral			Quinn's farewell dinner?					WESLEY			I... I didn't think it would be			appropriate.					PICARD			Why not?					WESLEY			I failed, Captain. I didn't get			into the Academy. I failed you...			and the Enterprise.					PICARD			Ridiculous. Did you do your best?	A beat. Wesley nods.          STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE          55.65   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(continuing)			When you test next year -- and			you will test again -- do you			think your performance will			improve?					WESLEY			Well, yes...					PICARD			Good. The only person you're			truly competing against is			yourself.					WESLEY			Then you're not disappointed?					PICARD			Your failures and successes have			to be measured within, Wesley.			Not by me or anyone else... But			if it helps you to know this, I			failed my first time. And you			may not tell anyone!					WESLEY			You? You failed?					PICARD			Yes. But not the second time.			Now, do me the honor of sitting			next to me at dinner. I'm going			to have to disappoint an old			friend.	Picard smiles at Wesley as they walk to the door.65A  INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Picard and Quinn stand next to the platform. The only	other person in the room is Tasha, at the controls.					QUINN			I wish I could convince you to			change your mind.					PICARD			I'll serve you better here.	Quinn gives up.          STAR TREK: "Coming Of Age" - 12/30/87 - ACT FIVE          56.65A  CONTINUED:					QUINN			This is where you belong.					PICARD			If you need me...	Quinn brushes aside Picard's concern.					QUINN			I've been playing politics too			long. Perhaps I see conspiracy			everywhere. Don't worry.	Quinn shakes Picard's hand and then steps onto the	platform.					QUINN				(continuing)			Safe travels, my friend.	Quinn nods to Tasha, who works the console. Picard	stares at Quinn for a long time, as if memorizing what	he looks like. The admiral is BEAMED DOWN.65B  INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard STEPS OFF the turbolift. He walks to where	Wesley sits at the Conn, and stands between Wesley and	Data.					PICARD			Set course to Algeron 4, Mister			Crusher.					WESLEY			Course plotted and laid in, sir.					PICARD			You know, we're really alike, you			and I. Both explorers to the			core... Engage, Mister Crusher.	Wesley smiles happily at Picard's praise.66   EXT.
