PLANET SURFACE - CEMETERY - DAY	A traditional FUNERAL is in progress. A large group of	MOURNERS, dressed in black, are gathered around a	COFFIN. The setting is a SUNNY clearing surrounded by	a large HEDGE. Stone-carved TOMBSTONES and other	traditional graveyard details can be seen. PICARD and	TROI are there, as well -- wearing their dress	uniforms.	BEVERLY is standing at the head of the coffin, speaking	to the group. It's a eulogy, and Beverly speaks with	great fondness.					BEVERLY				(to all)			Most people on this colony will			remember my grandmother as a			"healer"... but her abilities			went beyond that. She didn't just			relieve pain, or fight illness...			because she knew that well-being			is more than a healthy body. Her			remedies included words of advice			as often as they did medicinal			teas...				(smiles)			And sometimes they were just as			bitter-tasting.	As she speaks, the crowd listens intently... the mood	is somber.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			But Nana's favorite thing was			cooking. My most vivid memories			growing up were of Nana in the			kitchen... the sounds of bubbling			pots and wooden spoons... the			exotic tastes and smells...				(beat)			In fact, she was in the middle of			writing a cook book when she died.			I'd like to share with you one of			her recipes... it was my favorite.          STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - TEASER          2.1    CONTINUED:	Beverly picks up a PADD and begins to read from it.					BEVERLY				(reads)			"Nana's Gingerbread. Mix one gram			currants... six hundred			milliliters of flour... two			hundred milliliters buttermilk...			and a dollop of molasses... "				(beat)			"Two pinches of ginger and			cinnamon... and two hundred			milliliters of sugar."	As she reads, we see that the people in the crowd --	Picard, Troi, and the others -- are all smiling. The	recipe is soothing... a moment of peace and grounding	in this tragic time.					BEVERLY				(continuing, reads)			"Heat the oven until it's happy...			then pour the batter into the arms			of a welcoming pan... "				(an aside)			I never knew when an oven was			happy, and I never saw arms on a			pan... but it sure tasted great.	Beverly sets down the PADD.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			I'll miss Felisa Howard very			much... her healing... her			advice... and most of all, her			gingerbread.	A quiet moment, then Beverly steps to the side of the	grave. GOVERNOR MATURIN -- an ALIEN man in his late	fifties -- steps forward. As he speaks, FOUR	PALLBEARERS start to lower the coffin into the ground.          STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - TEASER          3.1    CONTINUED: (2)					MATURIN				(to all)			"And so now we commit her body to			the ground; earth to earth, ashes			to ashes, dust to dust... in sure			and certain hope that her memory			will be kept alive within us all."	The mourners begin a ritual procession by the coffin.	As they walk past, each one of them takes a hand-full	of DIRT and tosses it onto the coffin. Beverly stares	down at the grave...2    ANGLE ON COFFIN	As a hand-full of dirt hits the coffin... then	another...3    BEVERLY	Watches the coffin silently...4    ANGLE ON COFFIN	As another pile of dirt hits... and another... and	suddenly a single FLOWER is thrown onto the coffin --	a CAMELLIA, bright against the dark wood.5    BEVERLY	reacts, looks up to see --6    A MAN	is staring directly at her. His eyes are intense, face	utterly expressionless -- he's striking and attractive	but somehow strange. His skin is very pale, delicate,	eyes a striking GREEN in contrast...          STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - TEASER          4.7    BEVERLY	reacts to the man, startled -- who is he? Before she	can say anything, the man walks past her... and the	procession of mourners continues. She glances back at	the man, trying to shake the odd feeling. OFF her	curious expression...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE         5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            8    EXT. PLANET SURFACE - CEMETERY - DAY	A short time later. The funeral is over and many of	the mourners are slowly starting to leave, while others	have broken off into small groups, talking quietly.	Picard and Governor Maturin are standing off to one	side, mid-conversation.					MATURIN			How long are you planning to stay?					PICARD			Just a few more hours. Why?					MATURIN			Well, as I'm sure you know, Caldos			was one of the first terraforming			projects of the Federation. Some			of our weather controls and fusion			systems are nearly a century old.			I wouldn't mind having a starship			Engineer take a look at them...			perhaps give us a few upgrades.					(MORE)         STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE         6.8    CONTINUED:					MATURIN (Cont'd)				(smiles)			Maybe in exchange for a tour of			the colony... and a home-cooked			meal?	Picard looks over at Beverly, who can be seen standing	by the graveside, receiving condolences from a couple	of mourners. He grows thoughtful...					PICARD			We're due at Starbase six-two-one			tomorrow morning... but we can			delay that for a few days. Yes...			I'm sure we can find some time.					MATURIN			Excellent.	A beat. Picard looks around at the peaceful setting.					PICARD			I look forward to that tour. The			Caldos Colony is really an			impressive accomplishment. I			actually feel like I'm in the			Scottish Highlands.					MATURIN			That was the intent. The			cornerstone of every building in			town was brought from Edinburgh..			Glasgow... Aberdeen... The			founders wanted everyone to have			a piece of the real thing here.			They didn't just want to imitate			Scotland -- they wanted to			recreate it.	Picard looks at him.					PICARD			I'm curious, Governor... you're			obviously not from Scotland. What			drew you here?					MATURIN			There's something about the			culture... the heritage. When I			was a boy, my family visited			Glamis Castle in Scotland. As I			looked out across the highlands,			I felt as if I'd come home.         STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE         7.9    NEW ANGLE	Beverly is standing by the graveside, where TWO N.D.	COLONISTS are using old-fashioned shovels to fill in	the grave with dirt. A mourner hugs Beverly, then	walks off. A moment later Troi walks up and puts her	arm in Beverly's.					TROI			I thought it was a beautiful			eulogy, Beverly.					BEVERLY			Thank you.	Beverly looks around at the departing mourners.					BEVERLY			You know, I never realized how			many friends Nana had...					TROI			Did you come home often?					BEVERLY			Not really. After I married Jack			and moved to Earth... I never			seemed to get back here...	Beverly looks intrigued by something.					BEVERLY			Deanna... did you notice a			peculiar man at the service? He			looked like he was in his midthirties...			dark hair?					TROI			No...         STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE         8.9    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			He threw a flower on Nana's			grave... a camellia... it was her			favorite flower. She used to keep			them all over the house.					TROI			Maybe he was a friend... or one of			her patients.					BEVERLY			Maybe. It was just such a			personal gesture... and he gave me			the oddest look...	A beat, then Beverly shakes the feeling.					BEVERLY			Well... I suppose I should go back			to the house. There are some			things there I'd like to take care			of.				(beat)			It's only a few minutes away.			Would you mind coming along?					TROI			I'd love to.	As Beverly and Troi walk off...                                             CUT TO:10   INT. HOWARD HOME - DAY	A large, open living area. The LIVING ROOM is adjacent	to a SITTING ROOM... and there are doors to suggest	other rooms. There is a stairway leading up to an	offscreen second story. The decor should suggest an	earlier time and way of life -- a warm Scottish country	home from the early 19th century. Herbs and other	exotic-looking medicinal ARTIFACTS can be seen	throughout the house. And there are a few 24th century	devices in evidence -- a replicator, computer terminal,	etc.	Troi is standing at a table, looking at an old-style	PHOTOGRAPH of Beverly standing next to an elderly	woman. Beverly is standing nearby, looking through	some belongings.         STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE         8A.10   CONTINUED:					TROI				(re: photograph)			Your grandmother had remarkable			green eyes...          STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE 9-10.             10   CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY			Every woman in the Howard family			has had green eyes... except for			my mother and me.					TROI			How well do you remember your			mother?	Beverly stops, remembering.					BEVERLY			Not very well...

I just have the			image of her face... and I can			hear the sound of her voice, but			I can't tell you anything specific			she ever said...				(beat)			Mostly, I remember Nana.	Beverly sees something in a corner and moves to it...	stops at an exotic-looking CANDLE -- it has an	elaborate metal base with engravings on it. The candle	FLAME is burning brightly. (NOTE: It is not a waxburning	candle -- it looks more like the kerosene	variety.)					TROI				(re: candle)			That's beautiful... what is it?					BEVERLY			A family heirloom... it's been in			the Howard clan for at least			twenty generations. It's supposed			to symbolize the "enduring spirit			of the Howards, wherever they may			go -- a shining light to guide			their fortune."				(smiles)			Nana always kept it lit.

Beverly looks around for a long moment...	taking in the house... then she sits on a chair by the	fireplace and picks up a large leather-bound JOURNAL	sitting on a side-table with several other books. She	eyes it with curiosity, runs her fingers over the	cover, and opens it...10A  INSERT - THE JOURNAL	as she opens it to the first page, where the name	"FELISA HOWARD" is hand-written in ink. She turns to	a few more pages -- every page has a hand-written date	and journal entry on it...10B  RESUME SCENE	Beverly begins to flip through the pages... intrigued	by what she reads. She stands, still turning the	pages, and walks up the staircase, disappearing out of	view...10C  NEW ANGLE - THE ROOM	After a silent beat, a NOISE is heard at the door --	the rattling of the lock. The door creaks open... and	a man steps into the house. It's NED QUINT -- a dour	man in his mid-fifties with a heavy Scottish accent.        STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE        11A.10C  CONTINUED:	He walks directly to the table where the exotic candle	is burning. He eyes it with an angry and unhappy	look... then blows out the flame and is about to throw	the candle to the floor--					BEVERLY'S VOICE			Who's there?	Quint turns, surprised at the voice --11   INCLUDE BEVERLY	as she comes down the staircase.					BEVERLY			What the hell are you doing?         STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE         12.11   CONTINUED:	She rushes over to him, grabs the candle out of his	hands, angry.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			Get out of my house.					QUINT			I wouldn't get so high and mighty			with me, Beverly Howard Crusher.			I've spent more time here in the			past five years than you have in			the past twenty.	She looks at him in surprise, taken aback.					BEVERLY			How do you know who I am?					QUINT			I'm Ned Quint. I took care of			your grandmother's house and her			affairs.					BEVERLY			Nana never mentioned you...					QUINT			There's a lot of things she didn't			tell you.	Beat. Beverly examines the candle, calming down a	little. Quint eyes the candle with intent.					QUINT			Now -- let me get rid of that			candle.	Quint reaches out to take the candle from her, but she	pulls it away.					BEVERLY			What do you mean?					QUINT			That candle has brought nothing			but misery and bad luck to your			grandmother.	Beverly's eyes flash and she stiffens slightly.         STAR TREK: "Sub Rosa" - 11/05/93 - ACT ONE         13.11   CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY			Now listen, Mister Quint -- I			don't know what your relationship			was with my grandmother.
