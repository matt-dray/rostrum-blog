You might have learned			an interesting lesson. Tsk, a			macro head, a micro brain.	Worf is obviously unrepentant.

PLANET PLAIN (OPTICAL)	The bridge crew are standing in approximately their	previous bridge positions on a treeless planet plain.	They have just been snatched from their ship, their	captain and they are understandably confused and	uncertain except for Tasha and Worf whose security	orientation have them immediately combat ready.

As Riker, very curious,	moves toward "Q", CAMERA MOVES AND PANS TO REVEAL also	a headquarters-type campaign tent of the same era,	complete with shade canopy and transportable field	furniture. "Q" indicates two such chairs with a small	table which holds a pair of tall, cool drinks.					"Q" (MARSHAL)			Join me, Riker. A good game			needs rules and planning...	Riker hesitates.					"Q" (MARSHAL)				(continuing)			Wasn't it your own Hartley who			said "Nothing reveals humanity			so well as the games it plays?"				(smiles; nods)			Almost right. Actually, you			reveal yourselves best in how you			play.	Data has moved in next to Riker and speaks quietly.					DATA			Sir, what he has in mind could			provide us with vital information.	Riker nods, moves toward the campaign tent. "Q" sits,	waves invitingly toward the empty seat. He also picks	up one of the tall drinks and WE CAN HEAR ICE CLINKING	in it.22   RIKER AND "Q"	as Riker inspects the remaining drink without sitting	yet, picks it up and looks a question toward Troi.					TROI				(registering surprise)			What I sense is... pleasure, sir.	Riker sips the drink, registers surprise too.					RIKER			Incredible. I was just thinking			of an old-fashioned lemonade...        STAR TREK: Hide And "Q" - 9/25/87 - ACT ONE        12.22   CONTINUED:					"Q" (MARSHAL)			... and so it became that.

Hesitantly,	a couple of them sip. Worf, however, tilts his glass	pouring the contents out onto the sand. Strangely,	this pleases "Q"'s sense of humor.					"Q" (MARSHAL)			The rigid Klingon code! Drink			not with thine enemy!				(to Riker)			Which explains something of why			you defeated them.					RIKER			Still arguing the human past?			Perhaps you're not that original.					"Q" (MARSHAL)			Au contraire!

As Picard	seats himself:					PICARD			We'll confer on the bridge here			if no one...	Without looking in that direction, Riker gestures	Picard to be silent and, surprised, Picard hesitates	during which Riker turns toward the others.					RIKER			The bridge is fine since I've			called the entire staff...					PICARD				(interrupting)			Correction, Number One; knowing			the decision you face, I've			permitted you this gathering.	Riker seems genuinely amused by Picard's correction,	as if yielding to a bright but headstrong child. Riker	nods, uses a gentle tone.					RIKER			Of course, Jean-Luc.	Riker looks up startled to see Beverly and Wesley ENTER	bridge from the turbolift.					RIKER				(continuing)			This meeting isn't for you,			Wesley!					WESLEY			Why not, sir? You helped make			me a bridge officer...				(corrects self)			... an acting ensign.	Looking from one to the other.        STAR TREK: Hide And "Q" - 9/25/87 - ACT FOUR        44.91   CONTINUED:					RIKER			All right, he stays. The first			thing he'll hear is... because I've			been given unusual powers, I'm			not suddenly a monster. Except			for those abilities, and I don't			yet know how far they go... I'm			the same William T. Riker you've			always known.	There's a long silence, no one speaking up.					RIKER				(continuing)			Well?

Do you believe I			haven't thought of that, Jean-Luc?					PICARD			And have you noticed that you and			I are now on a first-name basis?	A flicker of surprise on Riker's features indicates	he really hasn't.					PICARD				(continuing)			Will, something has happened to			you already...					RIKER			In what way? Haven't you seen			how much I've regretted not saving			that child? Captain, using the			"Q" power to save her might not			have been wrong!				(to bridge crew)			No more than it was wrong to save			the rest of you from those soldier			things.					PICARD			Let's keep in mind that particular			danger was invented by "Q".        STAR TREK: Hide And "Q" - 9/25/87 - ACT FIVE        45.91   CONTINUED: (2)					TROI			What we represent to the "Q",			Will, are lowly animals, tormented			into performing for their			amusement...					RIKER			Actually, they think highly of			us, Troi.

It comes from a far corner	of the bridge where a Figure stands with its back to	us. "Q" turns now, revealing himself draped in what	is recognizable even in this century as the somber	robes of something like the Franciscan Holy Order --	and "Q" is playing it to the hilt with gentle voice,	kindliness shining from his face, fingers pointed	together as in prayer. He CROSSES IN to stand with	Riker, head bowed in humility.					"Q" (BROTHER)			Let us pray for understanding,			for compassion, for...        STAR TREK: Hide And "Q" - 9/25/87 - ACT FIVE        46.92   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(moving to "Q")			Let us do no such damned thing!				(pulls at "Q"'s robes)			What is this need of yours for			costumes?

Then it's not			yet certain? He's not yet			committed?					"Q" (BROTHER)				(quickly, loudly;				overlapping last line)			The truly evil part of this is			your jealousy, Captain.				(to Riker)			You love each one of your people!			Demonstrate it! You have the			power to leave each of them with			a gift proving your affection.	Riker isn't sure of this. He looks to Picard	inquiringly, but speaks a bit thickly at times.					RIKER			There'd be no... harm, would there,			if I, if I gave them something			I know they'd like?	Picard's next few expressions are a study in a change	of decision. His first instinct is to recommend	against it... and he almost voices it. But then, Picard	begins to suspect that this may, in fact, give Riker	a chance to understand the human effect of near-godlike	power.					"Q" (BROTHER)			How touching. A plea to his			former captain.				(watching Picard)			"May I please give some happiness			to my friends, sir? Please sir?"					PICARD				(beat)			In fact... I authorize and support			that idea, Riker.				(to the crew)			And please cooperate with him,			if you wish.					TROI				(troubled; cautioning)			Are you certain, sir?

Their surprise is complete. On a	very intimate level that concerns themselves, this	seems godlike power they are witnessing. Picard, on	the other hand, seems to be analyzing, measuring, what	is happening.					GEORDI			Hey Wes, you've grown into a very			good looking guy!	Tasha gives a "definitely" to that sentiment. Troi	is concerned about Beverly who seems stunned as she	walks nearer her son, scrutinizing him closely. Data	gives Picard a puzzled "what are you up to" look.	Picard appears to be holding his breath as he	anticipates further developments.96   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Riker is eyeing Data now.					RIKER			Data...					DATA				(forcefully shaking				 head)			No!					RIKER			It's what you've always wanted,			Data to become human!	Data almost says "yes," but then:					DATA			Yes, sir, that is true. But I			never wanted to compound one			illusion with another. It might			seem real to "Q" -- even you,			sir... but it would not be so to			me. Was it not one of the			Captain's favorite authors who			wrote, "This above all, to thine			own self be true?"				(beat)			Sorry, Commander, I must decline.	Riker turns to Geordi. As he moves to him and removes	the VISOR, unobtrusively handing it to Geordi:            STAR TREK: Hide And "Q" - 9/25/87 - ACT FIVE            50.96   CONTINUED:					RIKER			Well, my friend, I know what you			want. Welcome to the wonderful			world of vision.	Geordi looks around in awe. His eyes come to rest on	Tasha.					GEORDI			You're as beautiful as I imagined,			and more.					RIKER			Then we can throw the VISOR away?	Geordi slowly replaces the VISOR over his eyes.					GEORDI			I think not, sir. The price is			a little high for me. I don't			like who I would have to thank.			I can still steer the ship with			this.97   ANGLE EMPHASIZING WESLEY AND BEVERLY	as Beverly appraises the new form of her son.					BEVERLY			If you accept this new you,			Wesley, you'll lose wonderful			times, so many important			experiences...98   EMPHASIZING WORF (OPTICAL)	as Riker moves to inspect him in turn.					RIKER			And Worf, who wants nothing...					WORF			Except honor and my duty			fulfilled.					RIKER				(interrupting)			Proud warrior Worf, without a			single tie to his own kind...            STAR TREK: Hide And "Q" - 9/25/87 - ACT FIVE            51.98   CONTINUED:	In a LIGHT FLASH, it's not Worf who changes but someone	else who APPEARS at his feet -- a Klingon warrioress.	Her eyes flash as she looks up at her man Worf, an arm	encircles him at the knees -- her other arm holds a	Klingon weapon -- a kligat -- as she looks around, sees	nothing but sliens. Then moving with surprising speed,	she comes to her feet and lashes out with her weapon	at Troi, who is the person nearest. Worf moves quickly	too, takes the blow intended for Troi, SLAMS the	warrioress down. In Klingon tradition, she flattens	herself to the floor and crawls, SNARLING to embrace	Worf's feet.					WORF				(whirling to Riker)			No! She is from a world now alien			to me. I have no place in my life			for this now!99   ANGLE ON WESLEY	moving to Riker. His voice is that of an adult male.					WESLEY			Mister Riker...				(shakes head)			... it's too soon for this...					RIKER			If it's because your mother			objects...					WESLEY			No, I'd just like to get there			on my own. Honest!	Picard is now looking very pleased... both with himself	for estimating this correctly, and with his people for	their common sense. Riker sees and understands.					RIKER			How did you know, sir? I feel			like such... such an idiot!					PICARD			Quite right, you should!					RIKER			But it was... such a pleasure to			have been able to do those things.            STAR TREK: Hide And "Q" - 9/25/87 - ACT FIVE            52.99   CONTINUED:	As "Q" PASSES, Picard blocks his path.					PICARD			It's all over "Q". You have no			further business here.					"Q" (BROTHER)			Human, you have just destroyed			yourself... !					PICARD			But only after you've paid off			your wager, "Q".					"Q" (BROTHER)			I recall no wager!					PICARD			I'm sure your fellow "Q" remember			you agreed to never trouble our			species again. Just as they're			aware you've failed to tempt a			human to join you. So, "Q", I			strongly suspect you have some			explaining of your own to do...	A sudden MAJOR FLASH OF BRILLIANT LIGHT... wiping out	the entire SCENE for a moment. Then WE SEE REVEALED	the bridge crew exactly as we saw them when this ACT	began. "Q" is no longer there -- Wesley is fifteen	again -- Worf is without his warrioress -- Tasha is	the familiar security chief. And all are at their duty	positions, with Wesley assisting Data at Ops, Beverly	standing near Picard.100  ANOTHER ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD	Everyone is speechless. Then, Picard breaks the	silence.					PICARD			Extraordinary! "Q" sought to			discover the distinguishing			characteristic of humanity and			never learned what Coleridge			said: "It must be the possession			of a soul within us that makes			the difference."					GEORDI			Sir... we show the same "hole" in			time again.
