ASYLUM CELL	An austere room -- devoid of furnishings, except for a	BED and a DOOR with a small thick-paned window. RIKER	is sitting on the bed, dressed in casual hospital-type	clothing. He is trying to maintain control, but there	is an underlying tension. He looks strung out, like	he's been at this for a long time...	He speaks to an offscreen DOCTOR who we never clearly	see (this will be Data, speaking with a distinctive	accent so we don't recognize his voice).					RIKER				(to Doctor)			You're absolutely right, Doctor.			In fact, right now it's hard to			imagine ever hurting anyone...					DOCTOR (O.S.)			How do you feel about that person			you used to be?					RIKER			I feel... terrible. But thanks to			you, I'm much better now. And I			feel confident that when I leave,			I'll be ready to take my place in			society again.					DOCTOR (O.S.)			When do you think that will be?	Riker looks at him... gives him a nervous smile...					RIKER			Well... now. Right away.					DOCTOR (O.S.)			What makes you say that?					RIKER			You said when I was able to accept			what I'd done, and understood the			consequences of my actions, that			I'd be free to go.       STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - TEASER       2.1    CONTINUED:					DOCTOR (O.S.)			"Free to go." Are you saying you			don't think you should stand trial			for what you've done?	Riker pauses... he's skittish, trying to please the	Doctor and say the right thing -- but he's losing the	fight to stay calm.					RIKER			I'm looking forward to proving my			innocence...					DOCTOR (O.S.)			I thought you said you accepted			what you'd done.	Riker tries to backtrack.					RIKER			But that's not what I meant. I...			I meant that I was sick when it			happened. I wasn't responsible			for what I did...	A tense beat.					DOCTOR (O.S.)			How do I know that you're not just			telling me what I want to hear?	Riker doesn't have a response.					DOCTOR (O.S.)				(doubtful)			Perhaps we should continue this			discussion next week...	Riker's temper flares -- he stands.					RIKER			No. I want to talk about it			now...					DOCTOR (O.S.)				(calmly)			You're starting to sound angry			again. Maybe you need another			treatment...	Riker drops all pretense of being the "good patient"	and lets his genuine feelings come out.       STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - TEASER       3.1    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			What I need is to get out of this			cell. I'm locked up day and			night... you control every			move... tell me what to eat, what			to think, what to say...	Riker moves around the room, liked a caged animal.					RIKER				(continuing)			And when I show a glimmer of			independent thought, you strap me			down, inject me with drugs and			call it a "treatment."					DOCTOR (O.S.)			You're becoming agitated...					RIKER			You bet I'm agitated! I may be			surrounded by insanity, but I'm			not insane. And I won't let you			or anyone... me think I am....	Riker hesitates, stumbling over his words... tries to	correct his last statement.					RIKER			I won't let you or anyone think			that...	Riker's whole demeanor changes -- he stops being the	tortured patient and becomes just Wil Riker. He looks	offscreen and speaks to somebody.					RIKER			I'm sorry. Can we take it from			"You're becoming agitated"?2    NEW ANGLE	to REVEAL that we have been in the ship's THEATER. A	cell is set up on a stage. The theater seats are	empty, except for BEVERLY, who is directing the play.	DATA -- who is playing the Doctor -- is also on the	cell stage.       STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - TEASER       4.2    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY				(to all)			Why don't we break for tonight.			I think we've made a lot of			progress.					RIKER			But I'm still not confident about			that final speech...	Beverly moves to Riker onstage.					BEVERLY			There's such a thing as over-rehearsing,			Wil. You'll do just			fine.				(beat)			Try to relax. You're resisting			the character. Let yourself feel			what he's feeling.	Riker is frustrated.					RIKER				(unsure)			Maybe I'm just not right for this			part...	Data chimes in.					DATA				(to Riker)			Most humanoids have the potential			to be irrational. Perhaps you			should attempt to access that part			of your psyche.	Beverly nods, tries to give Riker the insight he needs.					BEVERLY			Haven't you ever felt at odds with			everyone -- like the whole world			was against you?	Riker thinks.					RIKER			Yeah... my first year at the			Academy...       STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - TEASER       4A.2    CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY			Try to tap into that feeling.			That's what your character is			going through in this scene.	Riker nods, feeling a little better.       STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - TEASER       5.2    CONTINUED: (3)					RIKER			I'll work on it...					BEVERLY			It'll be wonderful. You're going			to knock 'em dead.	Riker nods. As everyone moves to go...3    INT. CORRIDOR	A few minutes later. Riker walking along, still	dressed in his inmate costume. He's practicing lines	from his final speech, trying to get it right.					RIKER			"You control every move... tell me			what to eat, what to think, what			to say... "	He tries again, this time with more emphasis:					RIKER				(continuing)			"What to eat, what to think, what			to say... "				(beat)			"And when I show a glimmer of			independent thought, you strap me			down, inject me with drugs and			call it a 'treatment'... "	Over the above, a CREWPERSON walks past and gives Riker	a curious look. Riker is too absorbed to notice. He	stops at a Turbolift and taps a button by the door. As	he waits...					RIKER				(continuing)			"I may be surrounded by insanity,			but I'm not insane --"	The doors open and Riker runs directly into an ALIEN	LIEUTENANT. The Lieutenant stares at him with intense	eyes, face utterly expressionless. Riker steps back,	startled...					RIKER			Excuse me...       STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - TEASER       6.3    CONTINUED:	The Lieutenant walks past him. Riker enters the	Turbolift, glances back to see --	The Lieutenant has stopped and is watching Riker. For	a moment, he seems almost menacing. Then he walks off	down the hall...	Riker stands there a moment... trying to shake the	creepy feeling... Then he ENTERS the Turbolift. As	the doors close...                                              FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                 STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE       7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:           (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)            4    INT. READY ROOM	Riker and PICARD standing at the desk, looking at a	terminal.					RIKER				(surprised)			Tilonus Four? Didn't their			government just collapse?					PICARD				(nods)			It's in a state of total anarchy.			When the Prime Minister was			assassinated, a Federation			research team was on the planet.			It is believed they were forced to			go into hiding...				(beat)			Your mission will be to locate and			evacuate them.					RIKER			Can't they go to local			authorities?					PICARD			There are no local authorities.			The government's been splintered --			several factions are vying for			power. And they're desperate for			weapons or technology of any			kind...				(beat)			Apparently, some factions are			resorting to torture to gather			information. A Starfleet research			team would be a prime target.	Riker weighs the situation.					RIKER			Then I'll have to go alone...			undercover.      STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE      7A.4    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Agreed. Mister Worf is ready to			give you a detailed briefing on			Tilonian culture.	Riker nods... and smiles, remembering something.       STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE       8.4    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER				(smiles)			Looks like I'll have to back out			of Doctor Crusher's play after			all...	Picard reacts, supportive.					PICARD			No, no... you'll have plenty of			time for that, Number One. We			won't be arriving at Tilonus for			another five days.				(beat)			Besides, if you back out now,			Beverly will come after me to play			the part.	Riker nods and they exchange a smile. As Riker	EXITS...5    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Later. Riker and WORF standing at the wall MONITOR,	which displays an AERIAL MAP of TILONUS FOUR. Worf	points to a specific region on the map.					WORF			This is the last known location of			the research team. They had			occupied a small building in the			Southwest quarter of the city.			You will begin your search there.	Riker considers.					RIKER			The Southwest quarter covers over			two hundred square kilometers.			That's a lot of ground for one man			to cover...				(lightly)			I'd better pack an extra pair of			boots.       STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE       9.5    CONTINUED:	Worf shoots him a look, not in the mood for jokes. A	tense beat. Then he moves to the table, where SEVERAL	pieces of EQUIPMENT have been laid out -- a canteen,	some clothing, a tricorder, etc. Worf points to a	bundle of plain-looking CLOTHING.					WORF				(re: clothing)			This apparel will allow you to			pass as a common merchant.	Worf picks up a small Tilonian PENDANT.					WORF				(re: pendant)			This Tilonian pendant has been			equipped with a communicator			circuit.	Riker takes the pendant -- holds it up to the clothing.					RIKER				(with humor)			It doesn't really match the			outfit...	Worf's temper flares.					WORF			I suggest you pay closer			attention, Commander. Your life			will be at stake.	Worf stares intensely at Riker -- almost threatening.	It's a very odd moment -- strange and creepy.					WORF				(hard)			Do you understand what I am			saying?	Riker is taken aback by Worf's tone.					RIKER				(an edge)			Yes... of course I do...	Worf picks up a small, exotic-looking KNIFE. Riker	observes somberly, his mood darker now.      STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE      10.5    CONTINUED: (2)					WORF				(re: knife)			Because you will be posing as a			merchant, you will need to know			how to use the Nisroh for the			traditional bartering ceremony.	Worf demonstrates by raising the blade high into the	air, moving it in a complex, ritualistic manner...					WORF				(continuing)			You will be judged on your prowess			with the blade...	Worf moves the blade in quick thrusting motions...	faster.. more elaborate... Without warning, the blade	CATCHES THE SIDE OF RIKER'S HEAD. Riker recoils,	startled.	Worf reacts, genuinely concerned.					WORF			I am sorry, Commander! I did not			intend --					RIKER			That's okay, that's okay...	Riker touches his head -- the wound is bleeding.					RIKER				(continuing)			I guess I really wasn't paying			attention...				(beat)			I'd better get to Sickbay. We'll			pick this up later.					WORF			Aye sir...	Worf watches with concern as Riker heads for the	door...6    INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)	Riker sitting on a bed; Beverly HEALING his head wound	with a medical device.      STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE      11.6    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY				(with humor)			You'll do anything to get out of			this play, won't you?				(beat)			Well, you're going to have to do			better than this...	Riker smiles.					RIKER			The play's tomorrow night. I've			still got twenty-four hours left.	Beverly shuts off the device. Riker turns -- his wound	is completely healed.					BEVERLY			Don't get any ideas. I'll expect			you on stage at eighteen hundred			hours.					RIKER			Right...	Riker stands to go -- and stops, reacting to a sharp	pain in his head.					RIKER				(re: his head)			It still hurts...	Beverly quickly scans his head with a medical	tricorder.					BEVERLY			There's no nerve damage... you			shouldn't be feeling any pain.					RIKER			Probably just a symptom of stage			fright --	Suddenly, the doors OPEN and GEORDI rushes in with TWO	N.D. CREWMEMBERS. One of the crewmembers is badly	INJURED -- his face and uniform are marred by scorch	marks and blood. Geordi and the other N.D. carry him	along, urgent...					GEORDI				(re: wounded N.D.)			He was working on a conduit on			Deck Thirty-seven. A plasma torch			blew up in his hands...      STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE      12.6    CONTINUED: (2)	The crewmember screams in pain -- it's an awful sight.					WOUNDED CREWMEMBER			It hurts! Oh God -- it hurts!	The scene takes on a frantic, disturbing tone as they	help him toward a nearby bed...	Riker moves out of the way. The wounded N.D. moans in	pain and looks directly at him. Riker reacts,	startled. The N.D. stares at Riker even as he is laid	on the bed... as Beverly begins to treat the wounds...	He just keeps staring... strange... unsettling...	Riker edges toward the doors... unable to tear his eyes	away from the man... shaken by the sight... EXITS...7    INT. TEN FORWARD	Later. Riker and TROI sitting at the bar, drinks in	front of them. Riker is troubled by the day's events.					RIKER			I've been on a lot of missions...			and I've seen a lot of people get			injured...				(beat)			But I've never been affected like			this...	Riker is chilled by the memory.					RIKER				(continuing)			He was looking right at me.					TROI			And that was disturbing to you...					RIKER			It was like he was... blaming me			or something. But it's more than			just this one incident. For the			past few days, I've been feeling			like everyone's staring at me...			or talking about me...					(MORE)      STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - 02/16/93 - ACT ONE      13.7    CONTINUED:					RIKER (Cont'd)				(lightly)			I feel like I'm in "Frame of			Mind"...					TROI			"Frame of Mind"?					RIKER			Doctor Crusher's play. Ever since			I started rehearsing the role,			I've been feeling a little			restless... uneasy...	Troi considers.					TROI			You're probably drawing on			feelings that you're not used to			expressing...					RIKER			Yeah. The play is full of			disturbing images. People losing			their minds... being tortured by			doctors...				(beat)			I can't get it out of my head...	Troi is supportive, tries to help.					TROI			Sometimes it's healthy to explore			the darker sides of the psyche.			Jung called it "owning your own			shadow."				(beat)			This could be a sign that you're			a real actor, Wil. It's becoming			more than just a role to you.	Riker is intrigued by her words.					RIKER			Maybe you're right...					TROI			Don't be afraid of your darker			side. Have fun with it.	Riker nods, feeling better. He lifts his glass to take	a drink, and stops -- reacting to a pain in his temple,	where the wound was. He puts his hand to his head, and	something across the room catches his eye...    STAR TREK: "Frame of Mind" - REV. 02/24/93 - ACT ONE    14.8    NEW ANGLE	of the strange, alien Lieutenant (as seen in the	Teaser). He is sitting across the room, alone at a	table, staring at Riker with his expressionless face.	He stands and heads for the door...9    RESUME	Riker turns to Troi.					RIKER				(re: Lieutenant)			Who is that?	Troi turns to look, but the doors are just closing.	The Lieutenant is gone.					RIKER				(continuing)			You just missed him.				(beat)			Do we have a new Lieutenant on			board?					TROI			I'm not sure. Do you want me to			check the personnel logs?	Riker shakes off the creepy feeling, stands to go.					RIKER			No... I'll check them tomorrow...				(beat)			I think I'll get to bed early.			Tomorrow's the performance and I			want to be up for it.					TROI			I'm looking forward to it.				(beat)			Break a leg.					RIKER			I'll try not to take that			literally.	They share a smile.

But now there	is a full AUDIENCE -- Picard, Beverly, Worf, Troi,	Geordi and several other crewmembers and civilians are	watching, engrossed.	The play is in its final moments. Riker is sitting on	the bed, strung-out. Data (as the Doctor) is standing	nearby. Riker's performance is different from before --	more focused and authentic. A genuine passion drives	him through the scene -- he is utterly convincing in	the role.					DATA/DOCTOR				(doubtful)			Perhaps we should continue this			discussion next week...	Riker stands, temper flaring.					RIKER			No. I want to talk about it			now...					DATA/DOCTOR				(calmly)			You're starting to sound angry			again. Maybe you need another			treatment...					RIKER			What I need is to get out of this			cell.

He has no trouble with his final speech this	time around -- it's passionate and intense.					RIKER			You bet I'm agitated! I may be			surrounded by insanity, but I'm			not insane. And I won't let you			or anyone else tell me I am.	Riker prowls about the stage... hands shaking... voice	breaking with emotion. A believable, bravura	performance that has the audience riveted and moved.					RIKER				(continuing)			You can destroy my mind, but you			can't change the truth. I didn't			kill that man.				(beat)			And that's what's driving you			crazy...	A long tense beat.					DATA/DOCTOR			I can see we have a lot of work to			do.	Data turns and EXITS.
