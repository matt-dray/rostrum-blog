TEN FORWARD	Begin close on the mouth of a trombone... then reveal	RIKER playing the horn to an appreciative audience made	up of GEORDI, TROI and several CREWMEMBERS. Riker	finishes his recital with a flourish... and a flat	note. As Riker grins good-naturedly, everyone laughs	and applauds.					GEORDI			Alright, Commander... you've got			until your next birthday to get			that right.	As everyone laughs, Troi asides to Riker...					TROI			Many things improve with age...			maybe your trombone playing will			be one of them.	Then WORF and BEVERLY approach from the bar area. Worf	carries a large birthday cake covered with lit candles.					BEVERLY			It's candle time, birthday boy.	Worf places the cake on a table. Riker blows out the	candles to more applause. Then Troi approaches him.   STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 10/9/90 - TEASER   1A.2    CONTINUED:					TROI			What did you wish for, Will?					RIKER			Music lessons.	More laughter as we go to...3    INT.

I am detecting some			unusual fluctuations in subspace			frequencies.	Picard frowns.					PICARD			We had better take a look, Mister			Data.	The Supernumerary steps aside and Data takes his place	at the science station with Picard flanking him.    STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 10/9/90 - TEASER    2.3    CONTINUED:					DATA			It appears we are being probed.	Picard leans over him.					PICARD			Source?					DATA			The third planet of the Alpha			Onias system.

But I cannot be			certain.	Riker digests this. Then...					PICARD			I suppose you'll just have to go			down there and find out.	As he heads toward the aft Turbolift...					RIKER			Worf, Geordi... you're with me.	Then Picard stops him with...					PICARD				(half apologetic)			Number One... Happy Birthday.	Riker acknowledges this with a smile. Then as he,	Worf, and Geordi step into the Turbolift...6    INT.

Then Geordi scans with	his tricorder.					GEORDI			I'm detecting high levels of			volcanic gases... sulphur dioxide,			methane, hydrogen sulphide...					RIKER			Toxic?					GEORDI			We're okay for now... But I			wouldn't want to spend my vacation			here.					RIKER			What about energy readings?	Worf frowns at his own tricorder.					WORF			Magnetic clutter is increasing.			I cannot make an accurate			determination.					GEORDI			Same here. I'm getting some very			confused readings...					PICARD'S COM VOICE				(breaking up, through				 static)			Bridge to Riker. Report.

I am advising you...9    INT. CAVERN	Riker and his Team listen to the garbled transmission.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			... and your team to transport			up... At once...	Geordi reacts to his tricorder, turns, scans...					GEORDI			Good advice, Commander. We've			got a sudden build-up of gases			here... especially methane.	He indicates a roiling, swirling cloud of lethal	looking vapor which now blocks the far end of the	cavern. Riker reacts, keys his insignia...					RIKER			Transporter Room, take us up.10   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM	TRANSPORTER CHIEF HUBBLE struggles with the	Transporter Scan.					HUBBLE			I can't get a solid lock on you,			sir. Too much interference.11   INT. CAVERN - ON AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)	Gas boils up around them. The Away Team is coughing.	Geordi drops to his knees. Worf moves to assist him.	The BEAM OUT BEGINS, STOPS, then TRIES TO START again.12   OMITTED    STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/19/90 - TEASER    5.13   INT.

TRANSPORTER ROOM	Hubble fine-tunes her equipment, then energizes...					HUBBLE			I'm trying again, sir.15   INT. CAVERN	Geordi and Worf are both on the floor. Motionless.	Riker is the last to fall.									CUT TO:16   INT. RIKER'S SICKBAY ROOM	And a bright light on the Sickbay ceiling... Camera	tilts down to reveal an N.D.NURSE as she ENTERS and	reacts to an unseen patient.					N.D. NURSE			Doctor Crusher... He's awake.	Beverly ENTERS -- An older Beverly whose hair is now	styled differently and streaked with gray. We do not	see Riker's face as she leans over him.					RIKER			Beverly?					BEVERLY				(pleased smile)			You remember me... that's good.			What else can you remember,			Captain?					RIKER				(confused)			Captain?	And that's when we get a good look at Sickbay -- a	Sickbay which is subtly different. Riker reacts as	he looks up at --    STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/13/90 - TEASER    6.16A  ANGLE - THE DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE ABOVE HIS BED	With a highly reflective surface.

In fact, we expected			this.	Riker shows some steel.					RIKER			Could you be more specific?					BEVERLY			That day on Onias Three you were			infected with a strain of Altarian			encephalitis.

He can't negate the reality of	all this... at least not yet.					RIKER				(almost afraid to ask)			The Enterprise... for how long?					BEVERLY			Nine years.	Riker absorbs this latest blow. Then regains his	balance, and comes right back at Beverly...					RIKER			If I've lost my memory... how do			I find it again?					BEVERLY			Memory is formed out of			association. Smells, sounds, and			images in the present could			possibly trigger them.   STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/19/90 - ACT ONE   10.17   CONTINUED: (4)					RIKER				(seeing it)			Like the way a song can remind			you of... old friends...					BEVERLY			Exactly. In associational			therapy, we expose the patient			to familiar surroundings. This			could stimulate the brain's neural			synapses into regenerating.	Riker heads to the door, determined.					RIKER			Then let's get started. There's			nothing more familiar to me than			the Enterprise. If anything's			going to bring back...	But Beverly stops him with...					BEVERLY			Will... I said your memory could			return.

CORRIDOR	As Riker walks down the corridor with Beverly, he	reacts to the changes sixteen years have wrought upon	the Enterprise and her crew. (GENERAL NOTE: Throughout	the ship, the changes are extremely subtle.)					RIKER			What about Geordi and Worf? Were			they infected, too?					BEVERLY			Thankfully, no. Geordi appears			to have been immune and the virus			has no effect on Klingons.	A striking looking KLINGON WOMAN in a Starfleet uniform	walks by. As she strides off, Riker stares after her.					RIKER			Speaking of Klingons...   STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/19/90 - ACT ONE   11.18   CONTINUED:	Beverly manages a smile.					BEVERLY			There have been a lot of changes			on the Enterprise in the last			sixteen years.	They enter the Turbolift.19   INT.

Riker is delighted...					RIKER			Geordi...	Geordi turns around, bringing still another shock with	him. His VISOR is gone, replaced by normal eyes.					GEORDI			Good to see you up and about			again, sir.	Riker can't help staring...					RIKER			Geordi... your eyes... what			happened to your VISOR... ?					GEORDI			My VISOR?

Riker just nods, then moves	on, past the SUPERNUMERARY at tactical and down the	ramp... to see WORF at Ops.

He also turns, smiles	a toothy grin at Riker. Riker manages a stunned nod to	both aliens, then enters the Command Area. DATA (the	only crew member who is unchanged) sits in the center	chair. He rises at Riker's approach.					DATA			Welcome back, Captain. We did			not expect to see you on the			Bridge so soon.					RIKER			Commander Data... You are my First			Officer?	A beat.

I'll start at the			beginning, which was four years			ago. A Romulan battle cruiser			strayed into Federation space.			Its warp coils had collapsed, and			its life support was failing.					TROI			You saved them, Will. You and			the Enterprise.					PICARD			This impressed the Romulans, to			say the least. After years of			distrust and conflict, they			started to talk. You have been			our key spokesman...	Then to Riker's inquiring look.					PICARD			... in securing an alliance with			the Romulans.	Riker is stunned... but manages to keep his balance.					RIKER			How far have these negotiations			progressed?					PICARD			The preliminaries are over. All			we need do now is escort the			Romulan Ambassador to the final			session.					TROI			Where you will help complete the			negotiations and sign the treaty.	Riker digests all of this. Comes to a conclusion.					RIKER			Captain, excuse me, sir, I mean			Admiral...

But	they seem oblivious to his concern.					PICARD			I agree, Ambassador. All of the			difficult issues have been			resolved.					TOMALAK				(with a cordial smile)			After much debate. Your Captain			Riker is the kind of negotiator			even the Ferengi should avoid.					PICARD			But we have come to an agreement			both sides can live with.
