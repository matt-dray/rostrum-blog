DEEP SPACE (OPTICAL)	The USS ENTERPRISE moves through the galaxy at warp	speed.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 42303.7.			The Enterprise is bound for Star			Station India to rendezvous with			a Starfleet courier.	INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE	The lights on the bridge are down, with only the OPS	and CONN stations illuminated. An n.d. crew goes quietly	about it's business.	NOTE: THIS DIALOGUE HAS TO BE REWRITTEN:					PICARD (V.O.)			Hopefully the mission will			provide an opportunity to			evaluate our newest staff			officer...	INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS	A pensive CAPTAIN JEAN-LUC PICARD paces restlessly,	pausing in front of the antique brass ship's barometer	mounted on the bulkhead.					PICARD (V.O.)			In the short time she's been			aboard, Doctor Pulaski has			distinguished herself as a			meticulous and competent			physician. But can someone so			focused on her own specialty also			assume the broader duties of the			ship's Chief Medical Officer?	CONTINUED:	Absently, Picard raps the barometer's face plate with	his knuckle. Surprisingly, the needle moves --	pointing to "STORMY."	INT. TEN-FORWARD	COMMANDER RIKER, GEORDI and several male crewmembers	from Engineering are seated around a table near the	bow ports. The center of attention is clearly the new	Specialist Trainee, RINA, an arrestingly beautiful	young woman.					RINA			... warp drive theory always came			easy for me, but I'm looking			forward to some hands on			experience.					RIKER			I'm sure we'll be able to			accommodate you.	Rina is well aware that Riker is flirting with her,	but she's not flattered. She concentrates on finishing	her drink.	Geordi, on the other hand, seems oblivious to the	tension.					GEORDI			I know what you mean. It's a			really electrifying experience			to be down there where the action			is. Whenever I push the drive			past warp six I still get a lump			in my throat.	Riker takes Rina's empty glass from her hand.					RIKER				(standing)			Can I get you another?					RINA			Tell me Commander. Is it the			custom on the Enterprise for the			First Officer to wait on			trainees?	CONTINUED:					RIKER				(smiling)			If they were all like you, I'm			certain it would be.					GEORDI				(to Rina)			What's it like these days at the			academy? Is Tsiolkovski still			teaching Propulsion Theory?					RINA			Are you kidding? They'll have			to tear down the building around			him. The first time I saw him...	MOVE WITH RIKER as he heads for the bar carrying two	empty glasses. He slides them across the bar to an	n.d. bartender.					RIKER			Same again.	In the b.g. we see DOCTOR KATHERINE PULASKI leave her	table and approach Riker.					PULASKI			Good to see you, Commander. When			you missed your test this morning			we all feared the worst.					RIKER				(turning)			My apologies, Doctor. A minor			crisis...				(beat)			in Engineering.					PULASKI				(not buying it)			You know, a Rheinman tissue			sample sounds a good deal worse			than it is. I can assure you			there's no discomfort involved.					RIKER			It's not that! It's just... my			duties are so diverse.				(beat)			Suppose we leave the appointment			open?	CONTINUED: (2)					PULASKI			Spontaneity is the sand in the			clockworks of science.					RIKER			But it's just an unimportant			detail...	A raised eyebrow from Pulaski tells Riker this is a	dead-end.					PULASKI			If I didn't consider it important			I wouldn't insist. Don't force			me to relieve you of duty to make			my point.					RIKER			You can't be --				(beat)			I'll work something out. But			my schedule is tight for the next			three or four days...					PULASKI				(smiles)			So I see.	They both glance toward the table where Rina and Geordi	are still in conversation.	BEYOND THE PORTS the stars streak toward us at warp	speed.	Rina has a clear view.					RINA			Beautiful, isn't it?	GEORDI'S POV -- He "sees" the ship's navigational	shield as a gossamer scrim of shimmering color, and	beyond, countless waves of energy bursting from	exploding suns.					GEORDI			The most beautiful thing I know.	ON RINA as she turns to face him. She's not used to	hearing men talk like this.	INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS	Picard stands in the darkness, his face bathed in	starlight. He's staring out the port at the same view	that facinates Rina.	A CHIME SOUNDS.					PICARD				(to com panel)			Picard.					COM PANEL VOICE (V.O.)			Captain, this is the bridge.			We're receiving a distress signal			on an open sub-space frequency.					PICARD				(to com panel)			Sound emergency stations, and			respond on the same frequency.	Picard rushes for the door.	EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The great ship sweeps past at warp speed.	INT. BRIDGE	ENSIGN WESLEY CRUSHER emerges from the turbolift	adjusting his uniform and rubbing the sleep from his	eyes.	WE FOLLOW as he stops at the food slct, grabs a cup	of tea, and moves to replace the n.d. crewmember at the	CONN.					PULASKI (O.S.)				(from com panel)			Sickbay on full emergency			status, Captain.	Picard is on his feet with Riker and COUNSELOR TROI	next to him. COMMANDER DATA is at the OPS station and	WORF is at TACTICAL.					PICARD			Stand by, Doctor. Commander			Data. Have we locked on to the			signal yet?	CONTINUED:					DATA			Yes, sir. A voice only			transmission from the USS			Lantree, a Federation supply			ship.					PICARD				(to viewscreen)			Lantree, this is Jean-Luc Picard			of the USS Enterprise. What			is the nature of your emergency?	A long beat of silence as they wait anxiously for a	response.					VOICE (V.O.)				(from viewscreen)			-- can't hold out any -- dying			-- too many -- help ...				(silence)	Riker and Worf glance at each other.					DATA			Sir, we are still recieving their			signal. There is simply no			message.	CLOSE ON Picard's worried expression.					PICARD				(to viewer)			Lantree! Are you under attack?										FADE OUT:                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:	EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Underway at warp speed.	INT. BRIDGE	Picard and the others are at their stations.					PICARD				(to com panel)			USS Lantree, this is the			Enterprise, come in, Lantree.	Nothing.					PICARD			Replay that last transmission.	The Lantree's last desperate call is replayed.					VOICE (V. O.)				(from viewscreen)			-- can't hold out any -- dying			-- too many -- help ...				(silence)					PICARD (CONT.)				(to Troi)			Counselor?					TROI			Great stress is all I'm able to			sense.					RIKER			Have we got a fix on her?					DATA			Two point two milli-parsecs,			bearing three-zero at one-four-			five degrees.					PICARD				(to Riker)			Number One?	CONTINUED:					RIKER			We better take a look.				(to Data)			What vessel is it?	Data accesses the computer.					DATA			USS Lantree, a class R Starfleet			supply ship assigned to Gamma			seven seven, Captain L.I. Taleka			commanding. Normal complement,			twenty-six officers and crew.					RIKER			Armed?					DATA			Class three defensive only.					RIKER			Is she still underway?					DATA			Indeed. She is at maximum speed.	Picard and Riker glance at each other.					PICARD			Alter course to intercept.					WESLEY				(enters course)			Course to intercept.					RIKER			Execute.				(to Worf)			Let's go to Yellow Alert.					WORF			Yellow Alert, sir.	The KLAXONS SOUND.					RIKER			Engineering?	INT. ENGINEERING	KLAXONS continue as the crew moves to alert stations.	CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Engineering.	Geordi replaces an n.d. crewmember at the command console.					RIKER (V.O.)				(from com panel)			Give us maximum warp.					GEORDI			Maximum warp, sir.				(to crew)			Let's show 'em what we've got.	The crew springs to action. Rina is electrified.					GEORDI (CONT.)				(to Rina)			Go to the backpanels and give			me a direct reading of the			dilithium temperature spread.	INT. ENGINE ROOM	Rina enters...	And up on the catwalk, one of the crewmember is distracted	by her; he trips, and tumbles over the railing onto	the main deck.	The automatic ALARM SOUNDS. Rina and several others	rush to the man's aid. His leg is broken.	Geordi runs in.					GEORDI			What happened?					CREWMEMBER			My fault, sir. Missed the turn.	Geordi looks up at the catwalk, then down at the	crewmember. Then he looks at Rina.					GEORDI				(pained)			Ensign... maybe you better stay			in the control room.	Rina recoils as if she'd been slapped. But she says	nothing. Wounded, she gets to her feet and exits.	EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	In the distance is the USS Lantree, underway at warp	speed. The Enterprise is closing on her slowly.	INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE	The bridge crew is at stations. On the viewscreen is	the Lantree.					PICARD			Open hailing frequencies.					WORF			Hailing frequencies open.					PICARD			Lantree, this is the Enterprise.	No response.					PICARD (CONT.)			Captain Telaka, this is Picard,			USS Enterprise. Do you read me?	Only the EMPTY WHISTLING TONE of the Lantree's carrier	signal answers. The bridge crew is uneasy.					DATA			No life signs, Captain.					PICARD			Nothing?					DATA			Nothing, sir.					WORF			This could be an ambush.					RIKER			Force fields up. Arm photon			torpedoes.					WORF			Force fields up.					CREWMEMBER			Torpedoes armed and ready.					RIKER			Red alert.	The KLAXONS SOUND.	CONTINUED:					RIKER (cont.)			What else have we got in the			neighborhood?					WESLEY			No other vessels of any kind			within two parsecs.	The Lantree is now larger in the viewscreen.					PICARD			No battle damage.					DATA			All systems seem functional,			Captain. Everything is in perfect			order.					PICARD			And no life signs.					DATA			No life signs.	Picard turns to Riker.					PICARD			We're going to have to board her,			Will.	EXT. SPACE	The Enterprise and the much smaller Lantree streak	along together at warp speed.	INT. ENGINEERING	Riker talks to Geordi. Rina is here as well.					RIKER			The only way we can wind up in			the same starfield is if you			bring us out of warp speed at			precisely the same instant as			the Lantree.					GEORDI			First I have to get control of			the her engines. Very tricky.	CONTINUED:					RIKER			That's why we gave you the job.				(friendly pat)			Let me know as soon as you're			set.					GEORDI			Will I be on the away team?					RIKER				(aware of Rina)			Too dangerous for a valuable man			like you.				(smiles)			Fortunately, first officers are			expendable.	He starts out, then turns to Rina.					RIKER (cont.)			Just in case we don't make it			back...				(kisses her hand)			It was a pleasure.	He exits.	Geordi turns to the crew.					GEORDI			I'll man the bridge station.			Our first problem is to gain			control of the Lantree's drives.				(to Rina)			Come on. You'll get a chance			to see what the bridge is like			on alert.	Her eyes widen.	INT. BRIDGE	The first team is on the bridge as Geordi enters,	followed by Rina.					GEORDI			Ready to give it a try, Captain.	Geordi sits at the console with Rina watching over his	shoulder.	CONTINUED:					GEORDI			First we have to download the			Starfleet access codes for the			Lantree...				(punches buttons)	Not even Picard is immune to Rina's beauty.					PICARD				(smiling)			Ensign?	Rina is flattered at being noticed by the captain, but	she's still trying to keep an eye on what Geordi is	doing.					RINA			Yes, sir.					PICARD			Perhaps you'd like to take a look			from down here.				(indicates the area				 in front of the				 viewscreen)	Frustrated again; but she has no choice.					RINA			Thank you, Captain.	INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM	Worf, Riker, Data and a couple of n.d. crewmembers are	preparing to be transported.					RIKER			We're going in amidships			protected by an isolation			forcefield. We'll take one quick			look. Fifteen seconds. If we			don't like what we see, we beam			back immediately.					GEORDI (V.O.)				(from com panel)			We have a lock on the Lantree,			Commander.					RIKER				(to com panel)			Okay, let's drop out of warp			speed. And see if you can keep			us in the same galaxy.	EXT. SPACE	The Enterprise and the Lantree travel side by side.	AS THE TWO SHIPS DROP OUT OF WARP SPEED, they wind up	separated by some distance.	INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM	Riker and his team are ready.					GEORDI (V.O.)				(from com panel)			Sorry about that. We got as			close as we could.					RIKER			That's okay, Geordi. What's a			light year among friends?	Riker turns to the others.					RIKER			If it looks secure at first			glance, we'll proceed to the			bridge.				(beat)			If we find anyone alive, the			medical team will beam over.					WORF			Set phasers for kill.	They set phasers.					RIKER			Let's do it.	The controller touches the panel and they beam away.	INT. USS LANTREE	The away team materializes adjacent to the central	computer. Phasers at the ready, they find no one in	sight.	Data plugs a memory module into the computer, touches	a few buttons, then takes the module with him.					DATA			I have the ship's logs, sir.	Riker scans the area. He glances at Worf.	CONTINUED:					RIKER			Let's see if anbody's home.	Cautiously, they open the door to the adjacent area.	It's empty.	INT. CORRIDOR	Worf emerges. He checks the corridor. Still no one	in sight. Riker, Data and the others follow him out.	Slowly they move on. They come to the sickbay door.	Worf opens it, glances in--and freezes.					RIKER			What is it?	INT. SICKBAY	Every bed contains a body. Worf guards the entrance	as Data scans the bodies with a tricorder.					RIKER			How's the environment?					DATA			No abnormal viral or bacterial			forms.	Riker goes to the nearest bed and looks at the dead	crewmember's face. The man is wrinkled and ancient.					RIKER			They were carrying passengers?					DATA			He is not a passenger. He is a			crewmember.					RIKER			But he's nearly two hundred years			old!					DATA			It would seem they all are.	Riker looks around the room in astonishment. The other	corpses are equally antique.	Riker looks from one to the other in horror.	They back away.	INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS	The door opens and there is Worf at the ready with his	phaser. Data and Riker enter the room.	CAPTAIN TELAKA is sprawled across his desk, face down.	His hand still holds a communications device. Riker	looks down at it. The hand is thin, bony, and	wrinkled.					RIKER			How old was Captain Telaka?					DATA			Thirty-two earth years.	Riker reaches down and gently turns Telaka's head--knowing	what to expect, and still shocked by what he	sees.	The face is withered, and the transparent skin is	stretched over a toothless skull.	INT. LANTREE BRIDGE	The door opens and Riker enters, phaser at the ready.	Worf and Data follow him in.	At the CONN station, a crewmember is slumped over the	console. Like the others, he is wrinkled and ancient.	Grim, Riker moves to the console and touches a panel.					RIKER			Enterprise... this is the USS			Lantree.	Picard appears on the viewscreen.					PICARD				(from viewscreen)			Enterprise here.					RIKER			Captain, the entire crew has been			wiped out.					PICARD			What happened?	Riker looks down at the corpse of the toothless hag	in the first officer's chair.	CONTINUED:					RIKER			It looks like they were in a			battle with time, and lost.										FADE OUT:                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:	EXT.

ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY	One of the ancient looking Lantree corpses is lying	on a platform surrounded by a forcefield. The platform	moves slowly through a twenty-fifth century CAT scanner	as Dr. Pulaski and her assistants study the readouts	with growing frustration.					PULASKI				(to com panel)			Transporter Room, we're finished			here. Thanks for your help.					TRANSPORTER COM VOICE			You're welcome, Doctor.			Energizing now.	The corpse sparkles briefly then disappears. One of	the technicians touches a control panel and the area	inside the forcefield is flushed with an electric blue	light. Then the protective field is dropped.					PULASKI				(to com panel)			Captain. We've returned the last			of the Lantree crew to their			ship.					PICARD (V.O.)				(from com panel)			How soon will you have an autopsy			report, Doctor?					PULASKI				(beat)			From everything we can see...			they all died of natural causes.	INT. BRIDGE	Picard is seated at the command station.					PICARD			Natural causes? What in nature			could kill an entire crew at the			same time?					PULASKI'S COM VOICE			For the record Captain, these			people died of old age.	Data, at the OPS station, enters a query into his	console, and swivels to face Picard.					DATA			Sir, according to the Lantree			logs the oldest crew member was			seventy-three, and the mean age			of the crew was thirty-two point			six six.	INT. CONFERENCE LOUNGE	All of the regulars are seated around the conference	table.					PICARD			Doctor?					PULASKI			Every member of the Lantree crew			had a complete examination at			the beginning of their last duty			cycle just eight weeks ago.				(glances at Riker)			They were in perfect health.					TROI			Nothing since then? No geriatric			symptoms reported?					PULASKI			A single medical entry noting			that the first officer was			treated for Thelusian flu five			days ago.					PICARD			Thelusian flu?	CONTINUED:					PULASKI				(shakes her head)			An exotic, but harmless rhinal			virus. And there was no evidence			of infection in the first			officer's autopsy.					RIKER			If we don't know what we're			looking for, how can we be			certain the Lantree is safe?					PULASKI			We can't. We'll have to assume			whatever caused this is still			aboard.	Picard clenches his jaw.					PICARD			Lieutenant Worf. You know what			to do.					WORF				(standing)			Sir.	Worf exits.					DATA			Captain, the Lantree's last port			of call was three days ago. The			Darwin Genetic Research Station			on Gagarin Four.	Picard and Riker look at each other.					PULASKI			At the very least they deserve			a warning.					PICARD				(frowning)			I was thinking of a quarantine.					PULASKI			I'll consider that possibility.					PICARD			You'll con --	CONTINUED: (2)					PULASKI			Captain.

LANTREE - BRIDGE	Worf, surrounded by a protective force field, stands	in front of the Lantree's security station.					WORF				(to com panel)			Codename Firestorm. Access A-D-			three-three-two-four-nine.					COMPUTER VOICE			Federation security code			recognized. Access confirmed.	Worf takes a last look around the bridge. With great	sadness, his eyes move from one crewmember's body to the	next -- comrades in arms -- slain by an enemy they	never had a chance to fight.					WORF			Set auto-destruct. Twenty second			delay.					COMPUTER VOICE			Auto-destruct active. Eighteen			seconds... sixteen seconds...	Worf pauses for a moment, a silent salute to the	bravery of the Lantree crew. he touches his insignia.					WORF			Energize.	He's transformed into glittering energy and vanishes.					COMPUTER VOICE			Twelve seconds... ten seconds...	EXT.

Not that			she used the transporter much,			she preferred using the			shuttlecraft.				(shrugs)			I'd have given her a shuttle if			it would have kept her here.			Best CMO I ever served with.					PICARD			Tell me, Taggart. If she served			you as well as you say, why did			you let her go?	CONTINUED:					TAGGERT				(laughs)			I guess you haven't run into her			stubborn streak.				(beat)			The moment she heard of the			opening on the Enterprise, she			put in a request for transfer.			Knew your service record backward			and forward.

If we used a			sample of the doctor's DNA --			say from a blood test -- that			was taken before --					RINA			Could we filter out her genetic			alterations? Absolutely!					PICARD			You're picking up some bad			habits, Ensign, but yes, you took			the words right out of my mouth.				(beat)			Can you make the modifications?					RINA			Of course!					PICARD			Make it so.	He exits with Data.	Rina is dumbstruck.

Picard steps forward and	extends his hand.					PICARD			Welcome aboard, Doctor.	Everyone rushes to welcome the CMO back.	And Riker is ready -- anxious -- to bite the bullet.					RIKER			Doctor... I'm ready to take the			Rheinman test.	Pulaski looks at him quizzically.
