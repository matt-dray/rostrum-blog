ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF and SUPERNUMERARIES at their	stations. There is a sense of urgency in the air.					PICARD			Magnify.	Worf works his console. The image on the viewscreen	shows the plasma streamer in which a Federation SCIENCE	VESSEL, is trapped.					RIKER				(to Picard)			The last report we have says they			were observing the streamer at			medium range. Maybe they went			in for a closer look... got more			than they bargained for.					PICARD			Hail them.					WORF			No response.					PICARD			Life signs?	Data works his console.       STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - TEASER       1A.2    CONTINUED:					DATA			Our scanners cannot penetrate the			plasma streamer's distortion			field.	Picard considers the situation.					PICARD			Can we tractor the vessel out?        STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			No, sir -- the ionic interference			is too heavy.					RIKER			I'll take a shuttle.					PICARD			Too risky -- you could be pulled			in, too.				(to Com)			Bridge to Engineering -- Geordi,			can we beam an Away Team onto the			science ship?3    INT. ENGINEERING	GEORDI is at his controls, REGINALD BARCLAY a couple	of panels down; other N.D. ENGINEERS are also working.					GEORDI			We can beam them over there,			Captain -- but with all this			interference, we might not get			a positive lock to bring them			back.	Barclay gets an idea, turns to Geordi.					BARCLAY			Commander... what if we bridged			our Transporter system with			theirs? It might be enough to			cut through the ionic field.	Geordi thinks.					GEORDI			To do that, we'd have to activate			the Yosemite's Transporters by			remote...					BARCLAY				(quick)			No problem, sir. I can			reconfigure their controller to			accept commands from here.	Geordi is sold.        STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - TEASER        3.3    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Good idea, Reg.				(to com)			Captain, I think we can do it.			We're gonna bridge the two			Transporter systems.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Acknowledged. Meet Commander			Riker in Transporter Room Three.					GEORDI			Aye sir.				(to Barclay, on the				 move)			Barclay -- I'll need a systems'			engineer on this Away Team.	Barclay hesitates -- he doesn't want to join this Away	Team, tries to stall.					BARCLAY			I'll ask Ensign Dern to join you.					GEORDI			I meant you, Barclay.					BARCLAY			Shouldn't I stay here and set up			the remote link?	Geordi motions to Ensign Dern.					GEORDI			Dern can handle that. Let's go.	Barclay hesitates, but he has no choice. He stands	to follow Geordi, looking a little worried -- and the	reason will soon be clear. They EXIT.4    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Riker, Worf and BEVERLY ENTER. Geordi and O'BRIEN are	working the console. A few feet away, Barclay has a	wall panel open and is re-working isolinear chips --	he looks distracted by something. Riker stops at	Geordi and O'Brien.        STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - TEASER        4.4    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Status, Mister O'Brien?					O'BRIEN			You're in for a bumpy ride,			Commander.	Barclay reacts to the comment, alarmed -- listens to	the rest of the conversation with growing concern...					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			I'll have to send you over one			at a time... because of band-width			limitations. And the transport			cycle will take a bit longer.					RIKER			How much longer?					O'BRIEN			Four, five seconds... about twice			the normal time.	Barclay closes the wall panel and joins the others.	He tries to play it cool, like nothing's wrong.					BARCLAY			What do you... what exactly do			you mean by a bumpy ride?					O'BRIEN			There may be a small amount of			static charge accumulation.			You'll feel a bit of tingling --			nothing to worry about.	Barclay nods -- more worried than ever.					RIKER			Let's do it.	Riker steps up onto the Transporter stage. Barclay	stands a few feet behind the others, trying to hide	his nervousness.	O'Brien works the console.					O'BRIEN			Engaging system interlock...				(beat)			Pattern buffers synchronized...        STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - TEASER        5.4    CONTINUED: (2)	A HUMMING SOUND begins as the Transporter system	charges up -- and builds in intensity...					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			Phase transition coils at			stand-by...				(beat)			Energizing.	Riker DEMATERIALZES in a Transporter effect that is	noticeably longer and louder than normal. O'Brien	closely monitors his console. After a beat, he looks	satisfied.					O'BRIEN			He's there.	Without hesitation, Worf steps onto the Transporter	stage...5    INTERCUT: ANGLE FAVORING BARCLAY (OPTICAL)	as the process begins again. He watches, trying to	stay calm... but every detail of the process -- every	sight and sound -- seems to intensify his discomfort.					O'BRIEN (O.S.)			Engaging interlock...				(beat)			Buffers synched...	Again, the HUMMING NOISE builds...					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			Energizing.	We HEAR the sound of Worf dematerializing. Barclay	draws in a deep breath to calm himself. He doesn't	want to do this...					BEVERLY			I'll go next.	Beverly steps onto the stage.					O'BRIEN			Engaging interlock...				(beat)			Buffers synched...        STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - TEASER        6.5    CONTINUED:	O'Brien reacts to his console.					O'BRIEN			Whoa, wait a minute...				(works, confident)			I'm reading an ionic fluctuation			in the matter stream... No			problem.	O'Brien works, not too concerned.					O'BRIEN			Okay... Energizing.	Beverly DEMATERIALIZES. Barclay reacts, dismayed by	the complication. He's broken out in a sweat now...	and it's all he can do to keep himself from leaving	the room...					GEORDI (O.S.)			Barclay.	Barclay jumps, startled. Geordi motions to the	Transporter stage: "Your turn." It's an awful moment	for Barclay -- he doesn't want to reveal his true	feelings about this -- but what can he do?					BARCLAY			Aye sir...	He braces himself, walks toward the stage... steps onto	the stage... places his feet within a transport pad...	closes his eyes...					O'BRIEN			Engaging interlock...				(beat)			Buffers in synch...	The HUMMING NOISE builds. Barclay tenses up... readies	himself for the most dreadful experience of his life...					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			Phase coils...	Then, in an instant, Barclay is overcome with panic.					BARCLAY			I'm sorry -- I can't do this.        STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - TEASER        7.5    CONTINUED: (2)	Barclay steps down off the stage, quickly EXITS.	Geordi and O'Brien watch him go, surprised.

TROI'S OFFICE	TROI is talking to Barclay, who looks depressed by	recent events. He's moving around the room, picking	up objects and setting them down, anything to take the	weight off of the moment. Troi tries to reassure him.					TROI			You were faced with a difficult			transport, Reg. Anyone would have			been apprehensive in that			situation.	Barclay is despondent.					BARCLAY			Tell that to Commander La Forge			and the rest of the Away Team...					TROI			I'm sure they understand. As soon			as you feel up to it, you can			probably still join them --					BARCLAY				(quickly)			No.	Troi reacts, sensing a deeper issue at hand.					TROI			Reg... is there something you're			not telling me?	Barclay shifts, uncomfortable.					BARCLAY			Actually, this isn't the first			time I've been... apprehensive.				(beat)			Every single time I've had to do			it, I've had a certain feeling			of... I guess you could call it...				(finds the words)			... mortal terror.       STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - ACT ONE       9.6    CONTINUED:					TROI			I see. How long have you had this			fear of transporting?	Barclay shakes his head and shrugs -- his look says	that this is a serious problem for him. Troi	considers.					TROI			Why have you kept it a secret?					BARCLAY			Why? My career in Starfleet would			be over, that's why.					TROI			I doubt that.					BARCLAY			I usually manage to avoid it			somehow. You wouldn't believe			how many hours I've logged on			shuttlecrafts...				(shudders)			The thought of being deconstructed			molecule by molecule. It's more			than I can stand...	Barclay sits down, dejected.					BARCLAY			Ever since I was a child, I've			been scared to death that if I			ever dematerialized... I wouldn't			come back whole again.				(beat)			I know it sounds crazy.	Troi is reassuring.					TROI			There's nothing crazy about it,			Reg -- you are being taken apart			molecule by molecule. You're not			the first person to have anxiety			about transporting.	Barclay listens intently, wanting to hear more.    STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - REV. 7/17/92 - ACT ONE    10.6    CONTINUED: (2)					TROI				(continuing)			We can desensitize you to this			type of fear. It's a slow and			gradual process... but it works.					BARCLAY			It does... how?					TROI			Well... the first step might			be a relaxation technique. Like			Plexing.					BARCLAY			Plexing?					TROI				(nods)			It's a Betazoid method. The next			time you feel nervous about			transporting, you would stimulate			a neural pressure point -- like			this...	Troi demonstrates by quickly tapping her neck with her	index and middle fingers in the region just behind her	jaw.					TROI			There's a nerve cluster just			behind the carotid artery -- it			stimulates the part of the brain			that releases natural endorphins.	Intrigued, Barclay gives it a try -- he briskly taps	his neck.					BARCLAY			Plexing... sounds easy enough...	Barclay stops tapping, breathes a sigh of relief. He	stands, driven by a rush of confidence.					BARCLAY			You know, I feel better already.			I can do this.					TROI			Reg... there's no need to rush...      STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - ACT ONE      10A.6    CONTINUED: (3)					BARCLAY			No, no, no. We've talked before			about confronting my fears. "The			best way out is through." You			said that once, remember?					TROI			I suppose I did...					BARCLAY			I'm going to beam over there.			I can do it.	OFF Barclay's determination...7    EXT. SPACE - THE SCIENCE SHIP (OPTICAL)	trapped inside the gaseous layers of the plasma	streamer.8    INT. SCIENCE SHIP - OPS	The darkened room is heavily DAMAGED, as if by an	explosion. Charred black walls... overturned	equipment... no sign of a crew. Beverly is searching	the room... Geordi is studying a damaged console as	Riker and Worf ENTER from an adjoining corridor, having	completed a search of the science station.					RIKER			No sign of survivors. No sign			of a anyone.       STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - ACT ONE       11.8    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Maybe they abandoned ship.					WORF			Unlikely. Both escape pods are			still on board.	A beat as they consider. Geordi indicates the room.					GEORDI			Well, there was an explosion in			here. We know that much.					RIKER			Any idea what caused it?					GEORDI			I've ruled out a reactor core			failure... and there's no sign			of a systems overload.	Worf begins to scan the room with his tricorder, waving	it past the floor and ceiling and walls. He stops at	a wall with nasty-looking burn marks on it.					WORF				(off tricorder)			Blast analysis indicates the			explosion originated...	Worf follows his scan across the room... down along	the wall... and stops with his tricorder pointed at	the center of the Transporter chamber.					WORF				(continuing)			...here. In the center of this			transport chamber.					GEORDI			How is that possible? The			Transporter is still functional.					RIKER			Could someone have beamed an			explosive device aboard?    STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - REV. 7/17/92 - ACT ONE    12.8    CONTINUED: (2)	They consider the implications.					BEVERLY (O.S.)				(calls out)			Commander Riker...	Riker and Worf move to Beverly. She is looking at a	male CREWMEMBER, who is lying behind a large console.	Beverly scans the body with a medical tricorder.					BEVERLY				(re: crewmember)			Lieutenant Joshua Kelly -- he			was the ship's engineer.					RIKER			How did he die?	Beverly completes her scan, stands up.					BEVERLY			There's evidence of burns... but			they don't look serious enough			to have killed him... I'm going			to have to take him back for an			autopsy.	Riker nods. OFF his grim expression...9    INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	O'Brien is staring doubtfully at the person standing	next to him.					O'BRIEN			You're sure about this, sir?	INCLUDE Barclay, who is bravely trying to stay calm,	but not doing a very good job of it.					BARCLAY			I'm sure. Please proceed.					O'BRIEN			This'll only take a minute...      STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - ACT ONE      12A.9    CONTINUED:	O'Brien works the console. Barclay stares at the	Transporter platform, mentally preparing himself for	the journey. O'Brien tries to reassure him.					O'BRIEN			Should be a smooth ride over, sir.					BARCLAY				(unconvinced)			Good... good...	O'Brien studies him for a moment, feeling a genuine	sympathy for the man.       STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - 7/15/92 - ACT ONE       13.9    CONTINUED: (2)					O'BRIEN			I know how you feel about this,			sir.	Barclay is surprised.					BARCLAY			You... you're afraid of			transporting?					O'BRIEN			No -- of arachnids.				(off Barclay's look)			Spiders. Sickening, crawly little			things, don't you think? All			those legs...					BARCLAY			They've never bothered me.	O'Brien keeps working.					O'BRIEN			A few years back, I was called			in to re-route an emitter array			at a Starbase on Zayra Four.			Turns out the entire system was			infested with Talarian hook			spiders.				(beat)			Ever see a Talarian hook spider?	Barclay shakes his head, no.					O'BRIEN			Their legs are half a meter long.				(beat)			Anyway, I had a choice. Do I walk			away and let the emitter blow			itself to hell... or do I crawl			into a Jeffries Tube with twenty			hook spiders?	Barclay is hanging onto every word.					BARCLAY			What happened?    STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - REV. 7/17/92 - ACT ONE    14.9    CONTINUED: (3)					O'BRIEN			It was the hardest thing I ever			did. But I got through it. After			that, I was never quite as afraid			of spiders.	O'Brien's words have an effect on Barclay, who derives	a swell of courage from the story. He looks at the	Transporter platform and takes a deep breath.					BARCLAY			Thanks...	Barclay walks toward the Transporter platform... stops	and braces himself... every step is an event...	He steps up onto the stage... finds a Transporter	pad... Play the suspense as Barclay waits for the	moment to come. He starts to tap his neck, plexing as	he did in Troi's quarters. Tap, tap, tap...	O'Brien works the controls and the Transporter system	HUMS to life. The HUMMING grows louder. Barclay stops	tapping -- it isn't helping. He's sweating now...	heart pounding... terrified. O'Brien waves a hand over	the console.					O'BRIEN			Energizing.	Barclay begins to DEMATERIALIZE.                                             CUT TO:10   CLOSE ON BARCLAY - TRANSPORTER EFFECT (OPTICAL)	(Transporter Room side) partially phased, the room behind	him becoming SPARKLES OF ENERGY. For the first time, we	are seeing what it feels like to transport. Barclay	winces at the awful experience, but keeps his eyes open,	looking around, alert the entire time. After a few	seconds, we see Barclay himself start to PHASE OUT, as	his body is broken down into molecules...10A  BARCLAY'S POV (OPTICAL)	as O'Brien and the Transporter Room DISSOLVE away into	sparkles of energy. The SPARKLES momentarily fill the	entire field of view... then DISSOLVE out to reveal the	SCIENCE SHIP SET, with Geordi standing nearby...    STAR TREK: "Realm of Fear" - REV. 7/17/92 - ACT ONE    14A.11   INT.

Ready to			work?					BARCLAY			Yes, sir.					GEORDI			Good. Start by downloading the			ship's science logs. Over			there...					BARCLAY			Aye sir.	Barclay's confusion gives way to relief: he made it.	He moves to a wall, opens a panel, and starts to scan	the isolinear chips with a tricorder.12   ANGLE ON RIKER	As he crosses to Geordi.					RIKER			Still four members of the crew			unaccounted for. You come up with			anything?	Geordi indicates several metal FRAGMENTS that are	scattered on the floor.					GEORDI			I don't know how these fit in,			but...

He indicates the	box.					BARCLAY			So what's in the box?					O'BRIEN			I thought you might like to meet			Christina.	Barclay looks at him, curious.

Barclay looks down and	freezes when he notices that the tarantula is crawling	onto his hand.
