SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship orbits Bre'el, a small, verdant planet orbited	by a single moon, irregularly shaped.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 43539.1.			We have moved into orbit around			Bre'el Four to investigate a			potentially catastrophic threat			to the population from a			descending asteroidal moon...2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	To include MAIN VIEWER. PICARD, TROI and RIKER in the	Command Chairs. DATA and WORF at their stations.	SUPERNUMERARY at Conn. On the Main Viewer is DOCTOR	GARIN, a middle-aged man. He is obviously very	troubled. Another SCIENTIST is at his side. In the	b.g. various TECHNICIANS check monitors. It has the	look of controlled chaos that fills a hurricane center	during a big storm.					DATA			The satellite's trajectory			continues to deteriorate,			Captain... This orbit will bring			it to within five hundred			kilometers of the planet's			surface.					GARIN			We're predicting the atmospheric			drag will bring it down on the			next orbit.					SCIENTIST			Have you been able to find any			explanation for this?					DATA			No, Doctor... it is a most unusual			phenomenon.        STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/17/89 - TEASER        1A.2    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Won't the moon disintegrate prior			to impact?					SCIENTIST			No, it has a ferrous crystaline			structure and will be able to			withstand tidal forces, Captain...					RIKER			Couldn't we just blow it into			harmless chunks?					DATA			The total mass of the moon would			remain the same, Commander. And			the impact of thousands of			fragments would spread destruction			over an even wider area.        STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/16/89 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:					PICARD			How long before impact...					DATA			Twenty-nine hours... projected			somewhere on the western			continent. It would destroy an			area eight hundred kilometers in			radius.					SCIENTIST			That damage would be			insignificant, Captain, compared			to the seismic repercussions...			massive landquakes, and			tsunami...					GARIN			The force would raise a cloud of			dust around the planet, leading			to a significant temperature			reduction. We could be looking			at our own ice age.					PICARD				(keying insignia)			Commander La Forge, is there any			way the Enterprise might be able			to coax this satellite back where			it belongs... ?									INTERCUT:3    INT. ENGINEERING	GEORDI's at a console. SUPERNUMERARIES at various	positions. The matter/anti-matter blender bubbling with	power.					GEORDI			We'd need to apply a delta-vee			of at least four kilometers per			second. Even with warp power to			the tractor beam, it would mean			exceeding recommended impulse			engine output by at least			forty-seven percent. It'd be like			an ant pushing a tricycle... a			slim chance at best...        STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/17/89 - TEASER        3.3    CONTINUED:					RIKER				(to Picard)			Given a choice between slim and			none, I'll take slim any day...					PICARD			Make it so.					RIKER			Lieutenant Worf, signal all ships			in this sector to rendezvous and			join us in relief efforts.					WORF			Aye, sir.					PICARD				(to Main Viewer)			We'll keep you informed of our			progress. Picard out.4thru	OMITTED89    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The tractor beam flares out of the ship and grabs onto	the small moon. The warp engines flare brighter as we	apply power. The ship is trying to "plow" the moon	into a higher orbit.10   INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	As before. Picard and Riker looking at the viewer.	The tractor beam holds the small moon. The moon does	not move.	Picard gets up and walks closer to the viewer.					RIKER			Can you give us any more,			Geordi... ?					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Not without burning out the			tractor beam emitter... the			circuits are already beyond their			thermal limit.        STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/17/89 - TEASER        4.10   CONTINUED:					DATA			Delta-vee is ninety-two meters per			second. The mass is too great.			We are having an effect but it			is negligible.	In the background, a strange noise... it begins low...	more like a million voices than a million machines...					RIKER			What is that...					DATA			Unable to identify source...	It gets louder...					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Impulse engines passing saftey			limits. We're seconds from			automatic shutdown.					PICARD			Reduce engines... tractor beam			off...	The sound continues to grow... and seems to surround	the ship... they react... almost deafening now...					RIKER			Worf, what the hell do the sensors			show... ?					WORF			The sound is not registering,			Commander...	The sound swirling inside and all around... ends with	a slight POP. Q APPEARS, naked, suspended above	everyone, as though held by an invisible puppet.					Q			Red Alert.					PICARD			Q.	And Q promptly crashes to the floor.

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	As it orbits Bre'el, maintaining its distance to the	moon, Klyo.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, supplemental. We			are no closer to finding a			solution to the deteriorating			orbit of the Bre'el Four moon...			but with the arrival of Q, we now			have a good idea of the cause.18   INT. BRIDGE	Starting with Q putting on his jump suit...					GEORDI (O.S.)			We couldn't drive the tractor			emitters hard enough, Captain...	Panning to find Picard is getting a debriefing on the	failed moon attempt from Geordi...					GEORDI			The beam was flexing, and it was			impossible to transfer enough			kinetic energy to the moon...					PICARD			Our options?					GEORDI			We did everything by the book and			a little extra... we need more			time or more power and we're short			on both. I'll take a look and see			if there are any rules I haven't			broken.       STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/20/89 - ACT ONE       5A.18   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Keep me advised.	Geordi EXITS.

Whose lives?					PICARD			The millions of people down there			who are watching as their moon			falls out of the sky...					Q			I haven't the vaguest idea what			you're talking about... and I have			a much more serious problem...			I am no longer a member of the			continuum. My superiors have			decided to punish me.	Picard frowns... refusing to participate with this	game of Q's...					PICARD			And punish us as well, it seems...	He ignores Q, moves away...        STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/20/89 - ACT ONE        6.18   CONTINUED: (2)					Q			They said I've spread too much			chaos through the universe and			they have stripped me of all my			powers.	They look at him with disbelieving eyes. Off their	reaction --					Q			You do not believe me... ? Would			I humiliate myself like this?					RIKER			If it served your purposes, yes.					Q			It is the truth. I stand before			you, defrocked. I'm condemned			to be a member of this lowest of			species. A normal, imperfect,			lumpen human being.					TROI			Turning you into a human was part			of their punishment... ?					Q			No, it was my request. I could			have chosen to exist as a			Markoffian fire lizard or a			Belzoidian flea, anything I			wished... so long as it was			mortal, but I only had a fraction			of a second to mull and I chose...			"this"... and asked them to bring			me here...					TROI			Why?        STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/20/89 - ACT ONE        7.18   CONTINUED: (3)					Q				(moving to Picard)			Because in all the universe you			are the closest thing I have to			a friend, Jean-Luc.	Q smiles to Picard... Picard's look says it all. Data	aims a tricorder at Q.					DATA			He is reading as fully human.					Q				(looks around the				 bridge)			Is there an echo in here?					TROI			I'm even sensing an emotional			presence in him. I would			normally describe it as being			terrified.					Q			How rude.	Enough of this... Picard rises, moves back into the	fray.					PICARD			Q, what is it you want...					Q			Your compassion...				(a beat, off Picard's				 look)			All right... Sanctuary on your			ship... dreary as that may sound			to both of us...					PICARD			Return the moon to its orbit.					Q			I have no powers. Q the ordinary.					PICARD			Q, the liar. Q, the misanthrope.       STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/20/89 - ACT ONE       7A.18   CONTINUED: (4)					Q			Q, the miserable. Q, the			desperate. What must I do to			convince you people...					WORF			Die.        STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/20/89 - ACT ONE        8.18   CONTINUED: (5)					Q			Very clever, Worf. Eat any good			books lately?					PICARD			Fine. You wish to be treated as			a human?					Q			Absolutely.					PICARD			Mister Worf, throw him in the			brig.					WORF			Delighted, Captain.					Q			Jean-Luc... you can't do this...	Worf moves to him...					WORF			You will walk or I will carry you.					Q			Given the options -- I'll walk.	As they EXIT...					Q				(to Picard)			You've disappointed me, Jean-			Luc... I'm very disa...	And Worf closes the turbolift doors... Riker and Picard	exchange a glance.18A  INT. TURBOLIFT (FORMERLY SCENE 19)	Worf and Q.					Q			It was a mistake... I never should			have picked human... I knew it			the minute I said it.					(MORE)          STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - 11/14/89 - ACT ONE          9.18A  CONTINUED:					Q (Cont'd)			To think of the future in this			shell... forced to cover myself			with fabric because of outdated			human morality, to say nothing			of being too hot or too cold,			growing feeble as the years pass,			losing my hair, catching a			disease, being ticklish, sneezing,			having an itch, a pimple, bad			breath, having to bathe...					WORF				(acknowledges)			Too bad.19   INT. CORRIDOR (FORMERLY SCENE 20)	Q and Worf exit the turbolift and walk down the	corridor.					Q			"Klingon"... I should have said			"Klingon". In my heart, I am a			Klingon, Worf... So you understand			I could never survive in			confinement...			The universe has been my back			yard... this is cruel and unusual			punishment. As a fellow Klingon,			if you would speak to the captain			on my behalf, I would be eternally			grateful... which doesn't mean			as much as it used to, I admit.19A  INT. DETENTION CELL (OPTICAL)					WORF			Be quiet or disappear back where			you came from.	Worf ushers him in.					Q			I can't disappear any more than			you can win a beauty contest.					(MORE)          STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - 11/14/89 - ACT ONE          10.19A  CONTINUED:					Q (Cont'd)			If I ask a very simple question,			do you think you can grasp it			without troubling your intellect			too much... ready? If I still			had powers, would I permit you			to lock me away?					WORF			You have fooled us too often, Q.					Q			Perspicacity incarnate. Please			don't feel compelled to tell me			the story of "the boy who cried			Worf"?					WORF			Computer, activate forcefield.	The room is now divided by a rim of lights. Q tests	the force field. We see the EFFECT. Worf leaves. A	security guard holds position...					Q				(yelling at Worf)			I demand to be let out of here,			do you hear me? You will			deactivate this cell immediately.				(no answer)			"Romulan". I should have said			"Romulan", you Klingon goat!	And he sits down in frustration.20   OMITTED21   INT. READY ROOM	Picard and Riker seated at the desk.					PICARD			The question is -- what sort of			jaded game is he playing this			time?       STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/17/89 - ACT ONE       11.21   CONTINUED:					RIKER			Maybe he just wants a big laugh.			He'll take Bre'el Four to the edge			of disaster, then pull the moon			back.					PICARD				(thoughtful)			Or he may have nothing to do with			it at all.					RIKER			Do you honestly believe Q is			telling the truth?					PICARD			Oh, I agree that is highly			unlikely. But we have to proceed			with our current dilemma as though			Q is powerless to prevent it,			don't we?					RIKER			As he sits, and watches us			struggle...					PICARD			I don't see much choice.				(speaking to com)			Mister Worf, hail the Bre'el Four			science station...					WORF'S COM VOICE			They're standing by, Captain...	Picard turns on his monitor to reveal Garin and the	Scientist.					PICARD			I'm sorry to report that our first			attempt to restore the moon to			its proper orbit has failed.					GARIN			We have less than twenty-five			hours before impact...       STAR TREK: "Deja Q" - REV. 11/17/89 - ACT ONE       11A.21   CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			Our chief engineer is working on			ways to reinforce our tractor beam.					PICARD			There is hope... but if you have			an evacuation plan...					GARIN			We have already started moving			people from the coastal areas of			the western continent...					PICARD				(acknowledges)			We will make another attempt			shortly... Picard out.	He turns off the monitor...					RIKER			I gotta tell you Geordi is not			optimistic...	Suddenly, the room begins to glow...
