MAIN BRIDGE	WORF, DATA and WESLEY are at their stations. PICARD	and RIKER have their eyes on the Main Viewer. BEVERLY	and TROI are present as advisors. The entire ship is	on alert, ready for anything.					PICARD (V.O.)			The garbled transmission reported			the colony under attack from an			unidentified spacecraft.

The results are negative.					DATA			There is no response. Rana Four			is emissions quiet.	Troi is also having trouble with her specialty.					TROI			Captain, there are eleven thousand			inhabitants in the colony. At			this range I should be feeling			something.... I'm not.					PICARD			Mister Data, put the planet			on the Main Viewer.3    ANGLE - MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	The planet of Rana IV slowly grows into being on the	Main Viewer.					PICARD			Magnify.	The screen magnifies.

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND RANA (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise orbits Rana IV.6    INT. CORRIDOR	Picard with Troi and Beverly walk toward the	Transporter Room. He is consulting with them on the	two occupants of the structure on Rana IV.					BEVERLY			If they're the only survivors			of a global holocaust, they can't			be in very good shape.					PICARD				(to Troi)			Counselor... ?	They pause at the entrance to the Transporter Room.	Troi is vague and uncomfortable with her reading.					TROI			What I sense of them is human...					PICARD			And something else... ?					TROI				(hesitates)			It's difficult to explain... I			feel these two people are			somehow... different.				(apologetic)			I'm sorry. I cannot be any			clearer than that.	Riker EXITS the Transporter Room and joins them. Says	to Picard, indicating the room --					RIKER			We're ready.     STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - REV. 8/4/89 - ACT ONE     6.7    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Data, Worf and GEORDI are in position on the pad.	Riker and Beverly join them. Picard and Troi observe.					PICARD			Good luck, Number One.					RIKER			Energize...	The away team DEMATERIALIZES.									CUT TO:8    EXT. RANA IV - ESTABLISHING SHOT - HOUSE - DAY(OPTICAL)	The house, a typical twenty-fourth century colonial structure,	stands alone on its plot of trees and grass surrounded	on all sides by scorched earth. There is no sign of	life, inside or out.9    ANGLE ON FRONT OF HOUSE (OPTICAL)	As the away team MATERIALIZES in the protection of a	grove of trees near the house's front door. Riker	wants an instant survey.					RIKER			What can you tell me?					GEORDI			The house is a typical settlement			structure with adaptations. Its			thermal properties all seem to			conform to known materials.					DATA			If there are indicators as to why			this particular area has remained			intact, I cannot detect them.					RIKER			Worf, the interior of the house.	Worf is already scanning it with his tricorder. (NOTE:	The interior of the house is dark.)       STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - 7/31/89 - ACT ONE       7.9    CONTINUED:					WORF			One individual is located at the			south end of the house, the other			toward the north. There is a			weapon -- a low-yield phaser,			nonfunctional -- in proximity to			the front-room individual.	Riker considers all of this.					RIKER			I guess a frontal assault is			unwarranted. Stay here. I'm			going to try an old-fashioned			knock on the door.10   NEW ANGLE - RIKER	Riker leaves the cover of the trees and moves toward	the house. Suddenly Geordi sees something --					GEORDI			Commander, there's a --	Too late. Riker steps into a concealed snare that	hauls him up into a tree by one foot. The others leave	cover to help him. The noise and confusion is	considerable.11   ANGLE - FRONT DOOR OF HOUSE	An elderly man, KEVIN UXBRIDGE, comes cautiously out	of the house, holding the phaser.					KEVIN			Who's there? Who are you people?	The away team stops in its effort to get Riker down	and faces the threat. Riker, still hanging, has the	presence to respond.					RIKER			Commander William Riker, USS			Enterprise, and crewmembers. May			I get down and approach you, sir?	Data and Geordi go back to helping Riker.					KEVIN			You leave him right where he is.       STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - 7/31/89 - ACT ONE       8.11   CONTINUED:					WORF				(to Riker)			Commander, shall I incapacitate			him?					RIKER			No.				(to Kevin)			We're a rescue party. We picked			up your colony's distress call			and came as fast as we could.	Just then an elderly woman, RISHON UXBRIDGE, appears	at the front door. While Kevin is a naturally	suspicious person, she is naturally trustful. She is	thrilled to see the rescuers. She gently scolds Kevin.					RISHON			Kevin, what are you doing? Can't			you see they're here to help us?			Can't you see they're human?					KEVIN				(to Rishon)			Stay in the house, Rishon. It			could be some kind of trick.12   ANGLE - AWAY TEAM	As Rishon ignores Kevin and approaches the away team.	There are tears of joy in her eyes. Riker slips down	out of the tree.					RISHON			We'd just about given up hope.			We thought maybe the whole			Federation had been attacked.					BEVERLY			Do you know of any other			survivors?	Rishon looks at her with desperate eyes.					RISHON			It's been days since we've seen			or heard anybody else...				(off Beverly's look)			Please, no -- don't tell me we're			the only ones...     STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT ONE     9.12   CONTINUED:	Kevin tries to comfort Rishon. He says to Riker in a	shaky tone of voice --					KEVIN			They came in a spaceship so big			you could see it up in orbit.			They took our world apart piece			by piece.					RIKER			Who?					KEVIN			We don't know. We never saw			their faces.					RIKER			You don't know where they came			from -- where they are now?					KEVIN				(shakes head)			I guess they've gone away.	Beverly takes out her medical tricorder and scans the	couple. They react. Beverly is apologetic.					BEVERLY			I'm sorry. I'm only performing			a physical. Could I have your			names please -- for the record.					RISHON			I'm Rishon Uxbridge... and this			is my husband Kevin.	Data joins them with --					DATA			Botanists. Originally from the			aquatic city New Martim Vaz in			the Atlantic Ocean on Earth.			Residents of the Rana Four			colony for five years.				(to Rishon; a smile)			You, ma'am, are eighty-two years			of age and a composer of			Tao-classical music.					(MORE)     STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT ONE     10.12   CONTINUED: (2)					DATA (Cont'd)				(to Kevin)			You, sir, are eighty-five years			of age and a specialist in			symbiotic plantlife. You have			been married fifty-three years.	The couple stare at Data in amazement. So does the	rest of the away team. He explains --					DATA				(continuing)			I memorized the colony register			on the way to Rana in the event			such information was needed.13   ANGLE - RIKER	Riker moves away from the others to study the house	up close. Kevin leaves Rishon to follow him.					KEVIN			Is something wrong?					RIKER			Your house -- with your permission			I'd like to look inside.					KEVIN			Why? What could interest you			in there?					RIKER			Mister Uxbridge, as far as we've			been able to determine, you and			your wife -- and this house --			are all that survived the attack.			It was either a bizarre			coincidence or by design. I			don't favor the coincidence			theory.					KEVIN				(confused)			Are you saying we were left alive			intentionally?					RIKER				(hesitant)			Yes.     STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT ONE     11.13   CONTINUED:					KEVIN			I don't understand. You don't			think Rishon and I did something			to merit our survival, do you?			I mean, betrayed the others... ?					RIKER			I'm not accusing you of anything,			Mister Uxbridge. The attacking			force spared you for some reason.			We're only trying to find out why.				(indicates house)			May I look inside... ?					KEVIN				(numb; bewildered)			I said you could.14   INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM	As Riker ENTERS. The interior is as normal as a twenty-	fourth century colonial interior can be. There are elements	of Rishon, elements of Kevin. Nothing to indicate that	they are bad people. The rest of the away team follows	Riker in. They spread out.15   ANGLE - RISHON AND KEVIN	Rishon and Kevin ENTER the house. Rishon is determined	to make her rescuers welcome. She heads for the	kitchen with --					RISHON			I'll make a cup of tea for			everyone. We have wonderful tea			on Rana. It grows wild nearly			everywhere...	She suddenly realizes Rana IV and its tea are gone	forever; she can't finish. She hurries away to the	kitchen. Kevin watches her go. Worf approaches him	and makes an honest attempt to cheer him up.					WORF			Sir, may I say that your attempt			to hold our away team at bay with			a nonfunctioning weapon was an			act of unmitigated gall.	Kevin looks at the phaser that he's still holding.    STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - REV. 8/10/89 - ACT ONE    12.15   CONTINUED:					KEVIN			Didn't fool you, huh?					WORF				(rare smile)			I admire gall.	Geordi joins them. He too is interested in Kevin.					GEORDI			Excuse me. Out front -- that			was about the best job of			concealing a snare that I've ever			seen. Could you tell me what it			was for?					KEVIN			Got a local critter that's			developed a taste for what's in			the garden.				(sad realization)			Guess I should've dismantled it.			Guess I don't have to worry about			him anymore.	He happens to look across the room and see --16   ANGLE - DATA	Data has wandered to a small table where an ornate	MUSIC BOX sits. He studies the music box. Just then	Rishon emerges from the kitchen and moves toward a	cupboard where her tea service is stored. She sees	Data looking at the music box.					RISHON			Go ahead. Pick it up. It's a			music box. It's been in my			family for generations.17   TIGHT ON MUSIC BOX	Data carefully lifts the box. (NOTE: any convenient	waltz music will do for the music.) A few bars and we:									SMASH CUT TO:     STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT ONE     13.18   INT. ENTERPRISE - TROI'S QUARTERS - CLOSE ON TROI	Troi is going about her normal daily routine inside	her quarters. Suddenly she comes alert as if hearing	something. We realize she is hearing the music from	the music box in her head (although she doesn't know	this)! And it stays, playing over and over...19   BACK TO LIVING ROOM - RIKER AND BEVERLY	Riker and Beverly are consulting with each other near	the front door. Riker is at a lost to explain the	riddle of the house and Kevin and Rishon.					RIKER			I've been in every room. There's			nothing unusual about this house			except that it's here. What about			them?					BEVERLY			They're in reasonably good health.			Both show signs of mental stress.			Understandable considering what			they've been through.					RIKER				(mystified)			But somehow they're different.	Riker looks o.s. in the direction of Rishon (with	Data).					RIKER				(continuing)			Let's get back to the ship. We'll			take them with us.20   ANGLE - RISHON AND DATA	As the music in the music box runs down. Data smiles.	Just then, Riker interrupts them.					RIKER				(continuing)			Excuse, Mrs. Uxbridge. We have			to return to the ship now.					RISHON			Commander, I haven't finished			fixing your tea --     STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT ONE     14.20   CONTINUED:					RIKER			I'm sorry, but we're finished			here. We can give you and Kevin			time to pack. You can bring as			much as you want.	Rishon gives him a look of astonishment. Kevin appears	at her side and give Riker the same look.					RISHON			What do you mean pack?					KEVIN			You're not thinking of taking us			with you, are you?					RIKER				(surprised)			Surely you don't want to remain			here. How will you take care of			yourselves?					RISHON				(to Kevin; frightened)			Kevin, I can't leave my home!			Don't let them do this to us.					KEVIN			No one's going to make us leave.					RIKER			You'll be protected on the ship.			You could still be in danger on			Rana.					KEVIN			Commander, we appreciate your			concern but we're not going			anywhere. We'll manage. We			always have.	Riker thinks for a beat. These two people are beyond	his understanding. And he's concerned about them.					RIKER			All right. I can't make you come			with us. Are you familiar with			one of these... ?	Riker hands Rishon his communicator. She nods.       STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - 7/31/89 - ACT ONE       15.20   CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER				(continuing)			We'll remain in this system for			the next several days at least.			If you should reconsider, please			contact us.					RISHON			We'll be fine, Commander.

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND RANA IV (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise keeps orbit around the shattered planet.22   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - FAVORING PICARD	Picard is in the middle of debriefing Riker, Beverly,	Geordi and Data. Troi is there as a consultant -- but	she seems distant, lost in thought, troubled (because	the song is still playing in her mind). All are seated	at the table except Picard who paces with controlled	energy.					PICARD			Are they collaborators? Did they			in fact provide their colony's			assailants with something that			abetted the total destruction of			Rana Four in order to protect			their own lives?	Beverly is skeptical.					BEVERLY			What could two botanists in their			eighties possess that could			possibly aid whoever attacked this			planet?					PICARD			We have no idea what the enemy			needed, Doctor. Love, fear, hope			-- a cup of tea. It is a strange			universe we live in.					GEORDI			Maybe they're being held hostage			in some fashion.					BEVERLY			Nothing in the tricorder readings			indicated emotional stress.					PICARD				(looks to Troi)			Counselor... ?     STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT TWO     17.22   CONTINUED:	All eyes turn to Troi. But she hasn't heard Picard.	She is lost in her own thoughts. Picard has to repeat	--					PICARD				(continuing)			Counselor Troi... ?					TROI				(coming awake)			I'm sorry... I can't sense them			well enough...	Picard gives her a quizzical look. Suddenly from Geordi	--					GEORDI			Specimens...				(off their looks)			Maybe they've been preserved as			specimens... pets... trophies...			exhibits in a zoo...					PICARD				(thinks)			No. The assailants would have			picked someone younger for that,			someone who would have given them			a proper show for their money.     STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT TWO     18.22   CONTINUED: (2)	Picard looks at Riker --					PICARD				(continuing)			Number One, you say the couple			is incapable of sustaining			themselves?					RIKER			There's a fusion reactor in the			house, probably good for another			five years of power. But their			watertable is tainted and they			have no way of feeding themselves			other than a small garden.					PICARD			They won't come to the ship?					RIKER			They were adamant.	Picard considers all that he's heard for a beat.					PICARD			We'll do all that we can to help			them... but in the meantime I want			them kept under surveillance.	Suddenly Troi, looking pale and drawn, stands up to	leave.					PICARD				(continuing)			Counselor, is something wrong?					TROI			I'm sorry... I don't feel well.			I would like to go to my			quarters...					PICARD			By all means.					BEVERLY			Is there anything I can do?	Troi shakes her head and leaves the room without	another word. Picard watches her go, concerned. The	others too.									CUT TO:     STAR TREK: "The Survivors" - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT TWO     19.23   INT. CORRIDOR - ON PICARD	Picard walks alone, moving toward a turbolift.
