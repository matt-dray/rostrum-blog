                            TEASER                              

	FADE IN:

1    INT. CORRIDOR - PRESENT

	WORF and TROI ENTER from the Holodeck doors. They are
	dressed in casual clothing -- it's late, and the mood
	is light and intimate. Troi is smiling, and even Worf
	is happy -- it's clear they had a great time, wherever
	they were.

					TROI
			That was an incredible program.

					WORF
			I am glad you approve. I have
			always found the Black Sea at
			night to be a most... stimulating
			experience.

	Troi rolls her eyes at him as they begin to walk down
	the corridor.

					TROI
			Worf, we were strolling barefoot
			along the beach while balalaika
			music played in the air... ocean
			breeze washing over us... stars in
			the sky... a full moon rising...
			and the most you can say is
			"stimulating"?

					WORF
				(groping)
			It was... very stimulating.

	Troi smiles as they turn a corner...

									CUT TO:

2    ANOTHER CORRIDOR - PRESENT

	Worf and Troi walking towards her quarters.

					TROI
			The truth is, I don't spend nearly
			enough time on the Holodeck.
					(MORE)


    STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - TEASER    2.

2    CONTINUED:

					TROI (Cont'd)
			I should take my own advice and
			use it to relax.
				(beat)
			Next time, I'll choose the
			program. If you like the Black
			Sea, you're going to love Lake
			Cataria on Betazed.

	Worf frowns a little. They stop outside Troi's
	quarters. An awkward moment.

					WORF
			Deanna... perhaps before there is
			a "next time" we should discuss...
			Commander Riker.

					TROI
				(playful)
			Why, is he coming along?

					WORF
				(awkward)
			No... but I do not wish to... I
			mean, it would be unfortunate if
			he... if you and I are going to
			continue... I do not want to hurt
			his feelings...

					TROI
			Worf... I think it's all right to
			concentrate on our feelings...
			yours... and mine.

	She smiles affectionately at him, and Worf returns the
	smile. We can see that there is a genuine attraction
	between the two of them.

    STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - TEASER    3.

2    CONTINUED: (2)

	There is a beat as they look into each other's eyes...
	the sexual tension rises a notch... will they or won't
	they? Finally, Worf takes the plunge -- leans over to
	kiss her... she lifts her lips to his, but just before
	they can kiss, the nearby Turbolift doors OPEN and
	PICARD bursts out, wearing only his bathrobe --

					PICARD
			Counselor!

	Worf and Troi look at him, startled. Picard rushes to
	them. He's wild-eyed, clearly something is wrong.

					PICARD
				(urgent)
			What's today's date? The date?

					WORF
			Stardate 47988.

	Picard thinks about this for a moment -- trying to sort
	through something in his mind.

					PICARD
				(to himself)
			47988...

					TROI
			Captain, what's wrong?

	Picard looks at her.

					PICARD
			I'm not sure... I don't know
			how... or why, but...
				(beat)
			I'm moving back and forth through
			time.

	OFF their reactions...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            

	INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - PRESENT

	A short time later. Troi is handing Picard a cup of
	tea. Picard is pacing, trying to make sense of what's
	happening to him. Mid-conversation.

					PICARD
			It was as though I had physically
			left the ship and gone to another
			time and place... I was in the
			past...

					TROI
			Can you describe where you were...
			what it looked like?

					PICARD
			It's all slipping away so fast...
			like waking up from a nightmare...

	Picard concentrates.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			It was years ago... before I took
			command of the Enterprise. I was
			talking with someone... I don't
			remember who...
				(beat, remembering)
			But then -- everything changed.
			I wasn't in the past any longer...
			I was an old man, in the future...
			I was doing something outside...
			what was it?

	He holds out a hand, rubs his fingers together as
	though remembering doing something with his hands...
	but what?

					PICARD
			I'm sorry. It's gone. I can't
			remember...

					TROI
			It's all right. Have you
			considered the possibility that
			this was just a dream?

    STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE    5.

3    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			It was more than a dream... the
			smells and the sounds... the way
			things felt to the touch... it was
			all so real...

	Troi considers.

					TROI
			How long did you stay in each of
			these time periods? Did it seem
			like minutes... hours?

					PICARD
			I'm not sure.
				(struggling to recall)
			At first... there was a moment of
			confusion, of disorientation. I
			wasn't sure where I was. But that
			passed... and then I felt
			perfectly natural... as though I
			belonged in that time. But I
			can't remember how long I stayed
			there.
				(frustrated)
			I know this doesn't make much
			sense... it's a feeling more than
			a distinct memory.

	He looks down at his tea cup -- it's empty. Troi
	notices and picks up the tea pot to pour him another
	cup.

					TROI
			Maybe we can identify specific
			symbols. Can you remember
			anything you saw, an object, a
			building perhaps --

	As Troi talks, Picard extends his arm with his teacup,
	offering it to her. As he extends his arm, the SCENE
	SUDDENLY CHANGES TO:

3A   ANGLE - CLOSE ON A VINE

4    EXT. VINEYARD - FUTURE - DAY

	We are now twenty-five years in the future. Picard is
	an OLD MAN, wearing civilian clothes and a hat to
	protect himself from the sun. He has a beard and
	longer hair. (But he should not look as old as he did
	at the end of "The Inner Light".) He is kneeling in a
	row of grape vines at his home in France (as seen in
	"Family").

    STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE    6.

4    CONTINUED:

	He is reaching out for a vine with the same hand and in
	the same manner that we just saw him hold out his cup
	in Troi's quarters. As his hand closes around the
	vine, he hesitates. He seems disoriented, confused for
	a moment, just as he described to Troi. He looks
	around the vineyard in puzzlement. But the moment
	passes, and he accepts this time as the present.

	He concentrates on examining the vine in his hand. He
	takes a pruning shear and snips off a few stray
	branches. There are gardening tools nearby. He works
	quietly for a moment... then we hear a voice shout
	across the vineyard.

					GEORDI'S VOICE
				(calls out)
			Captain Picard to the Bridge!

	Picard reacts, a little surprised. He looks toward the
	sound of the voice, shielding his eyes from the sun...

5    NEW ANGLE

	revealing GEORDI walking toward Picard. He is wearing
	civilian clothes and he has also aged twenty-five
	years. His VISOR is gone and has been replaced by
	ARTIFICIAL EYES, which have a distinctive electronic
	look to them. Geordi is smiling broadly.

					GEORDI
				(with humor)
			Sir, I think we have a problem
			with the warp core, or the phase
			inducers, or some other damn
			thing.

	Picard stands up with some difficulty. He's old, and
	his voice and attitude should suggest advanced age and
	an eccentric, sometimes cantankerous demeanor.

					PICARD
			Geordi...

	The two men approach each other and shake hands --
	these are two old friends who haven't seen each other
	in a very long time.

					GEORDI
			Hello, Captain... or should I make
			that Ambassador?

    STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE    7.

5    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(snorts)
			Hasn't been Ambassador for a while
			either.

					GEORDI
			How about Mister Picard?

					PICARD
			How about... Jean-Luc?

					GEORDI
				(smiles)
			I don't know if I can get used to
			that.

	They look at each other for a moment, taking in the
	sight.

					PICARD
			Good Lord, Geordi. How long has
			it been?

					GEORDI
			Oh... about nine years.

					PICARD
			No, no... I mean, since you last
			called me Captain? When was the
			last time we were all together...
			on the Enterprise?

					GEORDI
			Close to twenty-five years.

					PICARD
			Twenty-five years...
				(looks him over)
			Time's been good to you.

	Geordi playfully pats his stomach.

					GEORDI
			It's been a little too good to me
			in some places.

	He glances around.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			Can I give you a hand?

					PICARD
			Oh... I'm just tying some vines.

    STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE    8.

5    CONTINUED: (2)

	Geordi kneels down and examines a vine.

					GEORDI
			Looks like you've got leaf miners.
			Might want to use a bacillus
			spray.
				(off his look)
			My wife is quite a gardener. I've
			picked up a little bit of it.

	Geordi takes a tie and begins carefully tying the
	vines. Picard bends down with a little difficulty...
	and the two of them start to work on the vines.

					PICARD
			How is Leah?

					GEORDI
			Busy as ever. She's just been
			made director of the Daystrom
			Institute.

					PICARD
			And the little ones... Bret and
			Alandra? And...

					GEORDI
			And Sidney. Not so little any
			more. Bret's applying to
			Starfleet Academy next year.

	Picard shakes his head at the rapid passage of time.

					PICARD
			So what brings you here?

					GEORDI
			Oh... I just thought I'd drop by.
			I'd been thinking about the old
			days on the Enterprise... and I
			was in the neighborhood...

	Picard gives him a sharp look. The Picard of the
	future is a bit disgruntled, a cranky old man.

					PICARD
			Don't give me that. You don't
			make the trip from Rigel Three to
			Earth just to... drop by.

	Geordi knows he can't fool this man. The mood becomes
	a little more somber.

					GEORDI
			No.

  STAR TREK: "All Good Things... "- REV. 03/14/94 - ACT ONE  9.

5    CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD
			So. You've heard.

					GEORDI
			Well... Leah has a few friends at
			Starfleet medical... and word gets
			around.

	Picard snorts and turns his attention to the vines.
	Grumpily --
					PICARD
			I'm not an invalid, you know.
			Irumodic Syndrome can take years
			to run its course.

					GEORDI
			I know. But when I heard I
			just... wanted to come by all the
			same.

	Picard looks at him for a moment, and then some of the
	crusty exterior falls away... and we can tell that
	despite his protestations to the contrary, Picard is
	warmed by the moment. Picard finally breaks the
	moment.

					PICARD
				(softer)
			Well... as long as you're here,
			you can help me carry in some of
			these tools.

	Picard awkwardly and painfully gets to his feet.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			My cooking may not be up to Leah's
			standards, but I can still make a
			decent cup of tea.

	Picard and Geordi both grab an armful of equipment and
	they start walking.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			By the way, I read your last
			novel. Not bad. I thought the
			protagonist was written a bit
			flamboyantly, but that's just my --

	Picard's eyes trail off as he sees something
	offcamera...


   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE   10.

6    PICARD'S POV

	Standing in the vineyards are THREE scraggly-looking
	HUMANS. They point at Picard, shouting and jeering.

7    RESUME PICARD

	He reacts to this strange sight in the vineyard.

8    NEW ANGLE - INCLUDING GEORDI

	Geordi follows Picard's look, but sees nothing. Picard
	is mystified -- what's going on? We MOVE IN on Picard.

					GEORDI
			Captain, are you all right?
			Captain?

					TASHA'S VOICE
			Captain?

	Picard turns at the sound of Tasha's voice, and as he
	does, the SCENE CHANGES TO:

9    INT. SHUTTLECRAFT - PAST

	Picard is sitting in the co-pilot's seat, wearing his
	OLD-STYLE UNIFORM as seen in the first season. TASHA
	YAR is sitting next to him. She looks exactly as she
	did in the series pilot.

					TASHA'S VOICE
			Are you all right, sir?

	He looks disoriented and confused again. He is still
	not fully aware of what's happening to him. Then the
	moment passes.

					TASHA
			Sir... ?

   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE   11.

9    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind
			seems to have wandered for a
			moment...
				(beat)
			What were you saying?

	Tasha has that no-nonsense, military prickliness.
	These are two people who have just met a short time
	ago.

					TASHA
			I was asking if you'd ever been
			aboard a Galaxy Class starship
			before, sir.

	Picard tries to focus his mind on the here and now,
	putting aside his strange feeling of disorientation for
	a moment.

					PICARD
			No. I'm, of course, very familiar
			with the blueprints and
			specifications... but this will
			be my first time aboard.

					TASHA
			Well then, sir, if I may be so
			bold -- you're in for a treat.
			The Enterprise is quite a ship.

					PICARD
			I'm sure she is.

	Picard gives her that strange stare again. For some
	reason, something about her troubles him slightly.

					TASHA
			Have I done something wrong, sir?

					PICARD
			No. You just seem very...
			familiar.

	She nods, uncertain exactly what he's talking about.
	The console BEEPS. Tasha hits a control and we hear a
	com voice --

					COM VOICE
			Enterprise to Shuttlecraft
			Galileo. You are cleared for
			arrival in Shuttlebay Two.

   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE   12.

9    CONTINUED: (2)

					TASHA
			Acknowledged, Enterprise.

	Tasha works the controls a moment, then looks out the
	window.

					TASHA
				(continuing)
			There she is...

	Picard looks out the window...

10   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Through the windows of the shuttle we can see the
	ENTERPRISE sitting in its dock above Earth.

11   CLOSE ON PICARD'S FACE

	As soon as Picard sees the ship, his feeling of
	disorientation is forgotten, and he can't help but
	smile at the beautiful sight. PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE
	ARE NOW IN:

12   INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - PRESENT

	Picard still smiling, staring, holding a cup of tea
	half-way to his mouth. (NOTE: We will no longer be
	using the convention of Picard returning to the exact
	moment he left.) Troi looks at him oddly.

					TROI
			Captain?

	Picard glances around, momentarily disoriented.

					PICARD
			Tasha... I was just with Tasha, in
			the shuttle...

	Picard slumps back into a chair. He puts his hands to
	his head, clearly distraught. Troi can see that
	there's something very wrong with the Captain. She
	hits a panel.

   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE   13.

12   CONTINUED:

					TROI
			Troi to Doctor Crusher.
			Something's wrong with the
			Captain. We're on our way to
			Sickbay.

	As Troi moves to the Captain with concern on her

13   INT. SICKBAY - PRESENT

	Later. Picard is sitting on a bio-bed, still wearing
	his bathrobe. BEVERLY is finishing a scan.

	Troi is standing with Picard as Beverly approaches with
	the results of a scan.

					BEVERLY
			I've finished the neurographic
			scan. I don't see anything that
			might cause hallucinations or a
			psychogenic reaction.

					TROI
			Is there any indication of
			temporal displacement?

					BEVERLY
			No. Usually a temporal shift
			would leave some kind of trypamine
			residue in the cerebral cortex.
			But the scan didn't find any.
				(lightly)
			Personally, I think you just enjoy
			waking everyone up in the middle
			of the night.

	Picard smiles a little -- grateful for Beverly's effort
	to lighten the mood.

					PICARD
			Actually, I just like running
			around the ship in my bare feet.

	Beverly smiles at him. OGAWA walks over, holding a
	PADD. She is visibly pregnant -- around six months.

					OGAWA
			The bio-spectral test results,
			Doctor.

	Beverly looks over the PADD.

					BEVERLY
				(to Picard)
			Your blood gas analysis is
			consistent with someone who's been
			breathing the ship's air for
			weeks.

			Thanks, Alissa.

	Ogawa smiles and withdraws. Beverly turns to Troi.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			Deanna... would you excuse us?

					TROI
			Of course.

	Troi moves away and EXITS Sickbay. Beverly turns back
	to Picard. She is solemn, troubled.

					BEVERLY
			Jean-Luc... I scanned for any
			evidence of Irumodic Syndrome, as
			you suggested. There wasn't any.
			But I did detect a small
			structural defect in your parietal
			lobe.

					PICARD
			A defect... that you've never
			noticed before?

					BEVERLY
			It's the kind of thing that would
			only show up on a level four
			neurographic scan.
				(beat)
			It could leave you susceptible to
			several neurological disorders...
			including Irumodic Syndrome.

	Picard absorbs this news.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			Now, it's possible you could have
			that defect for the rest of your
			life without developing a
			problem...

				(smiles wryly)
			Then why do you look like you've
			just signed my death sentence?

	He's trying to lighten the moment, and she realizes
	he's picked up on her underlying feelings.

					BEVERLY
			Sorry.
				(beat)
			I guess... this has caught me off
			guard.

	He takes a breath, squares himself -- he's not going to
	waste concern over something he can't control.

					PICARD
			Well, let's not worry about it.
				(beat)
			Something tells me you're going to
			have to put up with me for a very
			long time.

					BEVERLY
				(trying to be light)
			It won't be easy, but I'll manage.

	They smile at each other in a friendly, intimate way.
	RIKER ENTERS.

					PICARD
				(to Riker)
			Did Worf find anything?

					RIKER
			No, sir. His security scans came

	Picard gets up off the bed, thinks for a moment. He
	seems more sure of himself than he did earlier -- the
	memories are still vague but he's sure that something
	happened.

					PICARD
			It wasn't a dream... something did
			happen.

	Worf's COM VOICE interrupts --

					WORF'S COM VOICE
			Worf to Captain.

					PICARD
				(to com)
			Go ahead, Lieutenant.

					WORF
			Sir -- there is an incoming

	Reactions.

					PICARD
			Beverly?

	Beverly nods.

					PICARD

			Mister Worf, route it through to

	Picard moves toward the office...

14   INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS
(OPTICAL)

	Picard ENTERS, sits down at the desk and activates the
	desktop monitor. After a beat, ADMIRAL NAKAMURA
	appears on the screen.

					NAKAMURA
			Captain.

   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT TWO   17.

14   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Admiral.

					NAKAMURA
			I'm initiating a fleetwide Yellow
			Alert. Starfleet intelligence has
			picked up some disturbing reports
			from the Romulan Empire. It
			appears that at least thirty
			Warbirds have been pulled from
			other assignments and are heading
			for the Neutral Zone.

					PICARD
			Is there any indication why they
			would make such a blatantly
			aggressive move?

	Nakamura looks disturbed.

					NAKAMURA
			Our operatives on Romulus have
			indicated that there appears to be
			something happening in the Neutral
			Zone -- specifically, in the
			Devron System. Our own long range
			scans have picked up some kind of
			spatial anomaly in the area, but
			we can't tell what it is.

					PICARD
			What are our orders?

					NAKAMURA
			This is a delicate situation. I'm
			deploying fifteen starships along
			our side of the Neutral Zone. I
			want you to go there as well --
			see if you can find out what's
			going on in the Devron System.

					PICARD
			Am I authorized to enter the Zone?

					NAKAMURA
			Not yet. Wait and see what the
			Romulans do. You can conduct long-range
			scans, send probes if
			necessary... but don't cross the
			border unless they do.

					PICARD
			Understood.

15   EXT. VINEYARD - FUTURE - DAY

	In the same motion, the older Picard rises to his feet --
	and in doing so, stumbles and nearly falls. Geordi
	grabs him by the arm, tries to help him up.

					GEORDI
			Captain... what's wrong?

	Picard gets to his feet, looks around in confusion.
	Geordi is very concerned.

					PICARD
			This isn't my time. I belong
			somewhere else...

					GEORDI
			What?

	Picard stares at him, realizing he may not be making
	sense.

					PICARD
			I mean... I... I wasn't here a
			moment ago...

					GEORDI
			What do you mean? You've been
			right here with me...

	Picard gropes for an answer, tries to concentrate...
	but his mental faculties in this time period have
	deteriorated. He's much less cogent than the Picard
	we're used to -- it's hard for him to describe the
	experience.

					PICARD
			No, no... I was somewhere else...
			a long time ago...
				(beat)
			I was talking to someone...
			Beverly... Beverly was there...

	Geordi's beginning to worry that the old man is
	starting to lose it.

	Picard trails off, frustrated. Geordi looks at him.

					GEORDI
			Captain, I think we should go back
			to the house... call a doctor...

					PICARD
				(louder)
			No. I know what you're thinking.
			It's the Irumodic Syndrome -- it's
			beginning to -- to affect the old
			man's mind. Well, it's not that.
			And I wasn't daydreaming, either.

					GEORDI
			All right... all right... what do
			you want do about it?

	Picard thinks frantically for a beat, his mind trying
	to fasten onto a course of action. Finally, he seizes
	on something.

					PICARD
			I want to see Data.

					GEORDI
			Data... Why?

					PICARD
			I think he can help...

					GEORDI
			Help -- how?

					PICARD
				(angry)
			I don't know! I don't know, but
			I want to see him!

	Geordi takes a moment, not sure how to handle this
	situation, but finally agrees.

					GEORDI
			Okay... we'll go see Data. Is he
			still at Cambridge?

			Yes... yes... I think he's...

16   NEW ANGLE

	revealing SIX scraggly HUMANS standing nearby around
	Picard and Geordi. They are jeering and pointing at
	Picard, as seen earlier. Picard looks at them in
	shock.

				(urgent, to Geordi)
			Do you see them?

	No one is there.

16B  PICARD AND GEORDI

					GEORDI
			See... who?

					PICARD
			They're everywhere... laughing at

	Geordi doesn't know what to do -- it looks like Picard
	has gone completely crazy.

					GEORDI
			Come on, Captain... let's go see
			Data.

17   ON PICARD

			Yes... Data... yes...

	As they walk off...

									CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - FUTURE - DAY (MATTE)

	The old school looks much as it always has over the
	centuries, with a few 24th century touches.

 STAR TREK: "All Good Things... "- REV. 03/25/94 - ACT TWO 21.

19   INT. DATA'S LIBRARY - FUTURE - DAY

	A spacious and very comfortable room. The walls are
	lined with books. There is a FIRE roaring in the
	hearth. And there are about ten CATS wandering about
	or sleeping. (The mood and feel should remind us of
	the Sherlock Homes Drawing Room set.)

	Picard and Geordi are seated on a couch. DATA is
	standing nearby. He has not aged over the years, but
	there is a prominent streak of gray on one side of his
	head -- it looks unnatural, as if someone has taken a
	paint brush to his head. He is wearing the 24th
	century version of a smoking jacket. Data's struggle
	to become more human has progressed in the future. And
	although we will never spell out exactly how far he's
	come, we will see that he seems far more at ease with
	himself and others. He uses contractions, has a
	relatively sophisticated understanding of humanity, and
	seems to genuinely enjoy life.

					PICARD
			I know how it sounds... but it
			happened. It was real. I was
			back on the Enterprise.

	Data and Geordi exchange a look.

 STAR TREK: "All Good Things... "- REV. 03/25/94 - ACT TWO 22.

19   CONTINUED:

	Before they can comment, JESSEL, Data's English
	housekeeper, ENTERS with a tea service. She's a dour
	woman in her fifties with a heavy British accent.

					JESSEL
				(to Picard)
			How do you like your tea?

					PICARD
			Tea? Earl Grey. Hot.

					JESSEL
			Of course it's hot. What do ya
			want in it?

					PICARD
			Nothing...

	Picard shifts to another topic unexpectedly -- another
	sign that his mind tends to wander occasionally. This
	will continue to happen throughout the script.

					PICARD
			This is quite a place you have
			here, Data. I see they treat
			Professors pretty well at
			Cambridge...

	Picard laughs a little too loudly.

	Jessel brings tea to Data and Geordi.

					JESSEL
				(to Geordi, re: Data)
			If you're really his friend,
			you'll get him to take that grey
			out of his hair. He looks like a
			bloody skunk.

	Jessel moves back to the service, shoos a few cats off
	the furniture. Data gives Geordi a look.

					DATA
				(re: Jessel)
			She can be trying at times.
				(beat, smiles)
			But she does make me laugh.

					GEORDI
				(smiles)
			What is it with your hair, anyway?

					DATA
			I have found that a touch of gray
			adds an air of... distinction.

					PICARD
			Is this Earl Grey? I'd swear it
			was breakfast tea.

	Data moves back to Picard.

				(beat)
			You think I'm senile... that this

					GEORDI
			No one said anything like that.

	Data holds Picard's gaze steadily, not shying away from
	giving him the unvarnished truth.

					DATA
			In all honesty, Captain, it's a
			thought that has occurred to me.
				(beat)
			However, there is nothing to
			disprove what you are saying,
			either. So it's possible
			something is happening to you.

	Picard looks hopeful. Data starts pacing, a human
	gesture that Data has obviously acquired.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			The first thing we should do is
			give you a complete series of

			and possibly for the rest of the
			week.

	Picard is enthused.

					PICARD
			That's the Data I remember! I
			knew I could count on you!

	In his excitement, Picard spills some of his hot tea
	onto his lap. He yells out and JUMPS to his feet, and

20   INT. SHUTTLEBAY - PAST

	Picard is JUMPING out of the shuttlecraft, which is now
	sitting in the middle of the bay. Picard hesitates for
	a moment, disoriented at first. A large group of
	CREWMEMBERS are lined up in several ranks next to the
	shuttle standing at ease. Visible at the front of the
	group are Troi, O'BRIEN and Worf -- all are wearing the
	uniforms and "look" of "Encounter at Farpoint". Tasha
	steps out behind Picard and calls out in a loud voice:

					TASHA
				(to all)
			Commanding officer...
			Enterprise... arriving.

	At this command, an Ensign smartly brings an old-fashioned
	Bosun's whistle to his lips and BLOWS it. At
	the sound of the whistle, everyone in the bay snaps to
	attention. Picard stares at the scene for a moment,
	silently orienting himself to where and when he is. He
	takes a beat, then moves to a nearby podium, sets the
	PADD on it and looks up at the crowd. There's a
	distracted look on his face -- he's moving forward with
	the ceremony, but at the same time his mind is trying
	to assimilate all that's happened to him so far.

					PICARD
				(to all)
			To Captain Jean-Luc Picard,
			Stardate 41148...

	Picard glances up from the PADD...

	He reacts in surprise...

	There are now six scraggly humans standing on the
	catwalk, laughing and jeering.

26   PICARD

	looks away from the crowd, tries to concentrate on what

	Picard clears his throat and then continues...

			... to take command of the USS
			Enterprise as of this date.
			Signed Rear Admiral Norah Satie,

	He turns off the PADD, steps out from behind the podium
	and looks at his crew. They stare back at him
	silently, waiting for his first words for them -- the
	first words from the Captain of the Enterprise.

	PICARD'S POV - THE CATWALK

	There are now ten of the humans standing there -- all
	shouting at Picard with menacing looks.

32   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - PAST

	Picard is staring out the windows as the crew of the

			Mister Worf, I want you to
			initiate a Level Two Security
			Alert on all decks until further
			notice.

	Worf looks surprised, and gives an awkward glance to
	Tasha. Tasha takes a step forward. She keeps her
	voice level, but it's clear that Picard's order has
	rankled her for some reason.

					TASHA
			Sir, with all due respect... I'm
			the Security Chief on this ship.
			Unless you're planning to make a
			change...

	Picard is taken aback... reorients himself, then

	Picard, Worf, Tasha and Troi ENTER. Chief O'Brien is
	standing down in the command area. He hands a PADD to
	Picard. There are N.D. crewmembers milling about on
	the Bridge, working at opened panels... moving portable

					O'BRIEN
			Sir, Starfleet has just issued an

					TASHA
			What kind of vessels?

					O'BRIEN
			Freighters, transports... all
			civilian. None of them Federation
			ships.

	Picard reads the PADD, and as he does, his frown
	deepens -- what he reads rings a bell.

					PICARD
				(off PADD)
			It says a large spatial anomaly
			has appeared in the Neutral
			Zone...
				(beat)
			In the Devron System.

	Worf reacts strongly -- this is a younger, more
	outwardly aggressive Worf than the one we're used to
	seeing in the seventh season.

					WORF
			Perhaps it is a Romulan trick --
			to lure ships into the Neutral
			Zone as an excuse for a military
			strike.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Tasha, Worf)
			Starfleet's cancelling our mission
			to Farpoint Station and ordering
			us to the Neutral Zone as soon as
			we can leave spacedock.

	Picard considers -- his mind is racing, trying to
	figure out what to do next. He finally makes a
	decision.

			No... no, we'll proceed to

			Man your station, Mister Worf.

	Worf returns to the aft science station, bristling.

					TROI
			Captain, perhaps if we understood

			I don't intend to explain

			... to anyone. We will proceed to
			Farpoint Station, as originally

	A quiet, tense moment on the Bridge... no one moves.

			I think I know a way to get them

	Worf looks frustrated by her response. As Tasha walks
	across the Bridge, she moves past a WORKMAN, who is
	carrying a plaque toward the bulkhead next to the
	emergency Turbolift. He stops, lifts the ship's
	DEDICATION PLAQUE and begins to hang it on its familiar
	place on the wall...

34   INT. ENGINEERING - PAST

	Picard is in Geordi's office, sitting at a console,
	O'Brien standing next to him watching as the Captain
	rapidly works the console. Several N.D.s are working
	at various opened consoles and panels -- they're
	getting the ship ready to go.

	O'Brien is somewhat uncomfortable in the presence of
	the new Captain. Picard finishes working and hands
	O'Brien a PADD.

					PICARD
			Mister O'Brien, use these
			specifications to bypass the
			secondary plasma inducer.

	O'Brien takes the PADD, concern showing on his face.

					O'BRIEN
			You have to realize, sir... this
			isn't exactly my area of
			expertise. The Chief Engineer
			should be making these
			modifications.

					PICARD
			But the Chief Engineer isn't on
			board yet.
				(beat)
			Mister O'Brien... trust me. I
			know you can do this.

34   CONTINUED:

	He smiles at O'Brien, whom he knows well and fondly.

					PICARD
			All those years you spent as a
			child... building model starship
			engines... were well worth it.

					O'BRIEN
				(surprised)
			How'd you know that, sir?

					PICARD
			From... your Starfleet records.

	O'Brien is amazed that this Captain spent time
	scrutinizing the records so thoroughly... but it makes
	him feel more comfortable with this aristocratic man.

					O'BRIEN
			Yes, sir. I'll get right to the
			modifications.

	O'Brien takes the PADD and heads across the room.
	Picard continues to work in Geordi's office. Stay on
	Picard as O'Brien moves offcamera and begins giving
	orders to an offscreen Ensign.

					O'BRIEN'S VOICE
			Fletcher -- tell Munoz and Lee to
			get up here right away. We have
			to realign the entire power grid.
			We're all going to be burning the
			midnight oil on this one.

					DATA'S VOICE
			That would be inadvisable.

	At the sound of Data's voice, Picard turns and looks --
	and we now reveal Data, who has just entered the room.
	Through the following conversation, Picard watches with
	a smile as he sees O'Brien encounter Data for the first
	time.

	Data looks and acts as he did in the pilot. This is a
	less sophisticated, more naive Data than the one we're
	used to -- he's the Data we knew seven years ago: more
	innocent and less comfortable with everyday human
	interactions.

					O'BRIEN
			Excuse me?

  STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT THREE  33A.

34   CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA
			If you attempt to ignite a
			petroleum product on this ship at
			zero-hundred hours -- it will
			activate the fire suppression
			system, which will seal off this
			entire compartment.

	O'Brien looks at him blankly.

					O'BRIEN
			Sir... that was just an
			expression.

	Data reacts.

					DATA
			An expression of what?

  STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT THREE  34.

34   CONTINUED: (3)

					O'BRIEN
				(groping)
			A figure of speech... I was trying
			to tell him that... we were going
			to be working late...

					DATA
			Ah. Then "to burn the midnight
			oil" implies late work?

					O'BRIEN
			That's right.

					DATA
			I am curious. What is the
			etymology of that idiom? How did
			it come to be used in contemporary
			language?

	O'Brien isn't sure to what to make of this man.

					O'BRIEN
			I... don't know, sir...

	Picard finally comes to O'Brien's rescue.

					PICARD
			Commander Data, welcome aboard --
			it's good to see you.

	Data turns and sees Picard for the first time. They
	shake hands. Picard smiles at him warmly, genuinely
	glad to see him and have someone he can completely rely
	on. Data isn't sure why this man he has just met is
	smiling so warmly at him.

					DATA
			It is... good to see you, too,
			sir.

					PICARD
			I could use your help with the
			infusor array.

					DATA
			Certainly.

	They move to a wall panel near the warp core and open
	it. Picard points to a conduit.

					PICARD
			As you can see, we're having
			difficulty with the plasma
			conduits...

  STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT THREE  35.

34   CONTINUED: (4)

	Data eyes the panel.

					DATA
				(re: panel)
			This will require a completely new
			field induction subprocessor.
				(beat)
			It appears that we will be
			required to... ignite the midnight
			petroleum, sir.

	Picard glances at him, smiles slightly. Suddenly, we
	hear Beverly's voice --

					BEVERLY'S VOICE
			Jean-Luc... what's going on?

	Picard turns, and as he does the SCENE CHANGES TO:

35   INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE - PRESENT

	Picard standing in his bathrobe near the desk. Beverly
	and Riker are standing in the doorway, looking at him,
	puzzled. Picard is momentarily disoriented -- tries to
	orient himself to the here and now.

					PICARD
			It happened again.

	Beverly reacts.

					BEVERLY
			A time shift?

					PICARD
			Yes...

	Beverly immediately grabs a tricorder and scans
	Picard's head.

					RIKER
			What happened?

					PICARD
			It's still a little vague, but I
			can remember more this time. I
			think the more I shift between
			time periods, the more memory I
			retain...
					(MORE)

  STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT THREE  36.

35   CONTINUED:

					PICARD (Cont'd)
				(thinks)
			First, I was in what appeared to
			be the future... years from now.
			Then I was in the past again...
			right before our first mission...

	Beverly reacts to the tricorder readings.

					RIKER
				(to Beverly)
			What is it?

					BEVERLY
				(off tricorder)
			I just scanned his temporal lobe
			and compared it to the scan I
			performed just a few minutes ago.
			There's a thirteen percent
			increase of acetylcholine in his
			hippocampus.
				(to Picard)
			Within a matter of minutes, you
			accumulated over two days worth of
			memories.

	They all react... there's now real confirmation of what
	Picard's been saying. OFF Picard's reaction...

									FADE OUT.

36   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - PRESENT

	Picard, Riker, Worf, Data, Troi, Geordi, Beverly. Midconversation.

					PICARD
				(to Troi)
			Counselor, do you remember the
			first day I came aboard the
			Enterprise?

					TROI
			Yes.

					PICARD
			What happened after the welcoming
			ceremony?

					TROI
			There was a reception in Ten
			Forward... I introduced you to
			Worf and the other senior
			officers...

					PICARD
			Do you have any memory of me
			calling for a Red Alert in
			spacedock? Do you remember
			Starfleet diverting us from
			Farpoint to the Neutral Zone to
			investigate a spatial anomaly?

					TROI
			No...

	They consider this.

					DATA
			It would appear that there is a
			discontinuity between the time
			periods you have described.
			Events in one time period would
			seem to have no effect on the
			other two.

	They try to make sense of this.

					RIKER
			And yet in both the past and the
			present -- there's a report of the
			same anomaly in the Devron System.
			It's hard to believe that's a
			coincidence.

   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR   38.

36   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			For all I know, there may be one
			in the future, too.

					GEORDI
			Maybe the anomaly is some kind
			of... temporal disruption.

					BEVERLY
				(to Picard)
			But how is all this related to
			your time shifting?

					PICARD
			These are good questions. And I
			suspect I might find some answers
			when I return to the past... but
			for now we're facing a potentially
			dangerous threat from the
			Romulans.
				(beat)
			All departments should submit

			Dismissed.

	Everyone rises to go and heads for the door. Riker
	catches Troi's attention.

					RIKER
				(to Troi)
			Looks like it's going to be a late
			night... want to get some dinner
			first?

	Troi hesitates, glances at Worf. There's an awkward
	moment. Riker looks a little puzzled, not sure what's
	going on.

					TROI
			Actually, I...
				(re: Worf)
			I mean... we have plans.

	And in that moment, Riker suddenly realizes that Troi
	and Worf's relationship has progressed further than he
	ever realized. He's caught off-guard here, but tries
	to respond casually and naturally.

   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR   39.

36   CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
			Oh... I see. Well then... see you
			tomorrow morning.

					WORF
			Goodnight, sir.

					RIKER
			Worf...

	Worf and Troi EXIT to the corridor. Riker looks after
	them once they've gone. Clearly, the scene has
	disturbed him -- he's not sure how he feels about this.
	Finally, he turns and EXITS to the Bridge...

37   INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS

	Riker ENTERS. Beverly is standing near the aft
	console, watching Picard as he gives Data orders. The
	ship is at Yellow Alert.

					PICARD
				(to Data)
			... and I want continuous subspace
			sweeps. We might detect a
			temporal disturbance.

					DATA
			Aye sir.

	Riker and Picard move toward the Command area.

					PICARD
			Wil... this time shifting... when
			it happens, I experience a moment
			of disorientation. If this should
			happen during a crisis, I want you
			to be ready to take command
			immediately.

	Riker is still distracted by what just happened with
	Worf and Troi. He doesn't respond right away.

					PICARD
			Number One?

					RIKER
			Sorry, Captain. Be prepared to
			take command. Aye sir.

	Picard looks at him, notes his distraction.

   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR   40.

37   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Speaking of disorientation... are

	Riker tries to shrug it off.

					RIKER
			Just a little distracted. I'm
			fine.

	Picard doesn't quite believe this, but decides not to
	pursue the matter.

					PICARD
			You have the Bridge. I'll be in
			my Ready Room.

	Riker moves to sit down as Picard heads for the Ready
	Room.

38   ANGLE ON BEVERLY

	She watches Picard exit, a look of concern on her face.
	OFF her expression...

									CUT TO:

39   INT. READY ROOM - PRESENT

	Picard sitting at his desk. The door CHIMES.

					PICARD
			Come.

	Beverly ENTERS, walks directly to the replicator.

					BEVERLY
				(to replicator)
			Milk, warm -- dash of nutmeg.

	We HEAR the replicator work. Beverly takes a way a
	glass of milk and hands it to Picard.

					PICARD
			What's this?

					BEVERLY
			A prescription. A glass of warm
			milk and eight hours uninterrupted
			sleep.

					PICARD
			Beverly...


   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR   41.

39   CONTINUED:

				(lightly)
			Get some rest, or I'll have you
			relieved and sedated.

					PICARD
				(lightly)
			Yes, sir.

	They exchange a smile. Beverly puts her hand on his in
	a friendly gesture, but then leaves it there a beat
	longer then necessary, and gives it a little squeeze.
	She looks concerned. He looks up at her with a little
	bit of surprise.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			What's wrong?

	Beverly thinks, and for a moment, it seems as if she
	might say something... but she decides against it...
	she turns and heads for the door. Picard stands up.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Beverly.

	She stops, takes a moment, then finally turns around
	and looks at him.

					BEVERLY
			As a physician, it's often my job
			to give people unpleasant news...
			to tell them that they need
			surgery or that they can't have
			children...
				(beat)
			Or that they might be facing a
			difficult illness...

	She breaks off, looks away from him. Picard moves to
	her, touched by her concern.

					PICARD
			You said yourself it's only a
			possibility.

   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR   42.

39   CONTINUED: (2)

					BEVERLY
			But you've been to the future...
			you know it's going to happen.

	Picard takes a beat, then looks up at her again.

					PICARD
			I prefer to think of the future as
			something that is not written in
			stone. A lot of things can happen
			in twenty-five years.

	She looks at him for a moment, smiles... then leans
	over and kisses him on the lips. They pull apart after
	a beat. She looks into his eyes.

					BEVERLY
				(quiet)
			A lot of things can happen.

	Beverly turns and EXITS. Picard watches her go, a
	thoughtful look on his face... then he picks up the
	glass of milk and takes a sip... moves to the couch and
	stretches out. He's exhausted. He closes his eyes...
	his breathing deepens... he begins to drift off...

					GEORDI'S VOICE
			Sir? Wake up... sir?

	The SCENE CHANGES TO:

40   INT. DATA'S LIBRARY - FUTURE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Geordi is gently waking Picard, who is sleeping on
	Data's sofa. Picard blinks open his eyes.

					PICARD
			Yes... yes, what is it? Have we
			reached the Neutral Zone?

					GEORDI
			The Neutral Zone?

	Picard looks around, realizing what time period he's
	in...

					PICARD
			Sorry... I was... in the past
			again...
				(beat)
			What's going on?

   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR   43.

40   CONTINUED:

					GEORDI
			Data's arranged for us to run some

			lab. We're ready to go if you
			are.

					PICARD
			No... no, we don't have time for
			that. We have to get to the
			Neutral Zone.

					GEORDI
			Why?

					PICARD
			In the other two time periods...
			Starfleet reported a... uh... some
			kind of... spatial anomaly in
			the... in the...
				(beat)
			... in the Devron System! The
			Devron System in the Neutral Zone!

	Geordi sighs -- the old man's ravings are starting to
	get a little out of hand.

					GEORDI
			Sir...

					PICARD
				(thinking)
			If the anomaly was in the past...
			it might be here, too. We have to
			go find out...

					GEORDI
			Just because you've seen it in two
			other time frames, doesn't mean
			it's going to be here.

					PICARD
			But if it is -- that means
			something! Damnit, Geordi -- I
			know what we have to do!

	Geordi puts aside his own frustration.

					GEORDI
			Okay... but first of all, there is
			no Neutral Zone, remember?

	Picard thinks.

   STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR   44.

40   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
				(struggling)
			Right... right. Klingons... in
			this time period, the Klingons
			have taken over the Romulan
			Empire...

					GEORDI
			And the relations between us and
			the Klingons aren't real cozy
			right now.

	Picard struggles to his feet, irritated.

					PICARD
			I know that. I haven't completely
			lost my mind, you know.

	Picard pulls up short at his own tone, tries to take
	the edge out of his voice.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Sorry, Geordi... it's hard for me
			to concentrate... and remember
			things... I don't mean to take
			out that frustration on you...

					GEORDI
			It's okay...
				(beat)
			Well, if we're going to the Devron

42   INT. DATA'S LIBRARY - FUTURE - LATE AFTERNOON
(OPTICAL)

	A short time later. Where the hearth and fire were
	seen earlier there is now a large VIEWSCREEN and a
	computer console. Picard is talking to Admiral Riker
	on the viewer.

	Riker is twenty-five years older, his hair almost
	completely gray. His attitude is now that of a
	seasoned and experienced Starfleet Admiral... but
	there's something more. He's more brittle, less easygoing
	than the Riker we used to know... something's
	changed in him.

	He regards Picard fondly but with a hint of tolerance.
	The power relationships have changed here -- while
	Riker respects Picard he is no longer beholden to him.
	Mid-conversation. Data and Geordi are standing nearby.

					RIKER
			Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to
			help... but frankly, what you're
			asking for is impossible. The
			Klingons have closed their borders
			to all Federation starships.

					PICARD
			Wil... if this... spatial anomaly
			really is in the Devron System...

					RIKER
			I saw a report from Starfleet
			Intelligence on that sector this
			morning. There's no activity...
			there's nothing unusual happening
			in the Devron System.

					PICARD
			I don't believe that! Maybe their
			long-range scanners are flawed...
			we have to go there, see for
			ourselves!

	Riker is reluctant to turn him down flat... he looks
	for a way to ease out of it.

					RIKER
			Data, what do you make of all
			this?

	Data considers. He no longer makes decisions based
	purely on logic, but compassionately takes feelings
	into account, too.

			I am not certain. I cannot
			disprove what the Captain is

			And he is convinced he is

	Riker eyes him. Clearly Data is siding with the
	Captain. Riker feels he has to do something.

42   CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
			Right.

			Look, I've got the Yorktown out
			near the border... I'll have them
			run some long range scans of the

			anything, I'll let you know.

					PICARD
			That's not good enough.

					RIKER
				(firm)
			It's going to have to be. I'm
			sorry. That's all I can do.
			Riker out.

	The transmission ENDS. Picard steps back from the
	Viewscreen, frustrated and angry. Data turns to the
	computer console.

					DATA
				(to computer)
			Computer -- restore holographic
			image.

	The Viewscreen and computer console VANISH and are
	REPLACED by the fireplace and roaring fire.

					PICARD
				(angry)
			Damn him anyway... after all we've
			been through together... he's been
			sitting behind that desk too long.

					GEORDI
			Well... I guess all we can do is
			wait to see if the Yorktown finds
			anything.

					DATA
			There is another option.

	Picard looks hopeful, but Geordi is exasperated -- he
	was hoping that Riker had put an end to all this.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			We could arrange passage aboard a
			medical ship.

					PICARD
				(excited)
			Yes... yes...

	Geordi is a little chagrinned, but opts not to fight
	about it.

				(resigned)
			So now all we need is a medical

			Data, Geordi...

	There is an awkward beat as Beverly and Picard look at
	each other -- there is a tension in the air. At the
	exact same moment, Beverly moves to hug him, but Picard
	holds out his hand to shake hers. Then they both see
	what the other is doing, and they switch -- Beverly
	starts to shake his hand and Picard moves to hug her.
	They both finally drop their hands and smile at each
	other, embarrassed and amused at their own awkwardness.

					PICARD
			Let's just... choose one.

	They move toward each other and gently hug for a

	they separate and there's the awkwardness again.

					PICARD
			Well. Did you get my message?

					BEVERLY
			Yes. Jean-Luc... going into

				(shakes her head)
			But I never could say no to you.

			Ah. So that's why you married me.

					DATA
			How would you define unusual, sir?
			Every region of space has unique

	Picard thinks, remembers what happened originally.

					PICARD
			There should be a... "barrier" of

			It's the right time... right

			Who, sir?

	Picard straightens up and looks around the Bridge.

			Q! We're here! This has gone on

	There is no answer. The Bridge crew exchange looks

					Q
			It's Judge Q to you. And isn't it

	Picard looks around at the courtroom, the unruly crowd.

					PICARD
			The last time I stood in this

					Q
				(mocking)
			"Seven years ago... " How little

			you be so linear, Jean-Luc?

					PICARD
				(doggedly)
			You accused me of being the

					Q
			I believe my exact words were "a

					PICARD
			But we demonstrated that mankind

			benevolent. You agreed, and let

	Picard takes a breath, looks around the courtroom

					PICARD
			Are you putting mankind on trial

			Yes.

			Why?

					Q
			Oh, I'm sorry. That's not a "yes
			or no" question. You forfeit the

	He regards Picard with scorn.

					Q
				(continuing)
			I expected as much. You're such
			a limited creature... a perfect
			example of why we've made our

	Picard gives him a questioning look.

					Q
			The trial never ended, Captain.
			We never reached a verdict. But,
			now we have: you're guilty.

					PICARD
			Guilty of what?

					Q
			Of being inferior.

	Q looks at Picard with unconcealed contempt.

					Q
			Seven years ago I said we'd be
			watching you. And we have been.

			indulging Data in his witless

					PICARD
			We have journeyed to countless new

					Q
			In your own paltry, limited way.
			You have no idea how far you still
			have to go.

					PICARD
			We are what we are, Q -- and we're
			doing the best we can. It's not
			for you to set the standard by
			which we're judged.

					Q
			Oh, but it is. And we have. Time
			may be eternal -- but our patience

					PICARD
				(tight)
			Having rendered a verdict... have

					PICARD
			I think that this time, we have no

			What makes you say that?

			what happens to me.

					DATA
			That is true. Q's interest in you

	Picard shoots him a dirty look.

			That was only an analogy, Captain.

					PICARD
				(catching on)

	and take out a medical kit... prepare a hypospray...

					PICARD
				(to Riker)
			Wil, don't leave! We have to stay

					RIKER
			Captain, we can't stay...

	Picard is frantic to convince Riker to stay -- but his

	sounds almost like hysteria.

					PICARD
			We have to! Everything depends on

				(sotto)
			Alissa lost the baby.

	Picard reacts.

					BEVERLY
			I think it's the same thing that
			happened to Geordi. Somehow, the
			temporal energy from the anomaly
			caused the fetal tissue to revert
			to an earlier stage of

			unborn child began to... grow
			younger... until finally the DNA
			itself began to break down.

	Picard looks over at Ogawa.

					PICARD
			How is she?

					BEVERLY
			Physically, she's fine. For now.
			But if this temporal reversion
			continues, I don't think any of us
			are going to be fine for much

			That's a pretty big decision, Jean-Luc...

	Picard turns to see that Q is standing in the room. He
	is dressed in his Starfleet uniform.

					Q
			Tinkering with an anomaly you know

	FADE IN:

108  EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - FUTURE (OPTICAL)

	coming out of warp.

109  INT. BRIDGE - FUTURE (OPTICAL)

	Riker, Picard, Beverly, Data, Worf, Geordi, Gaines.
	Gaines at tactical, N.D.s man the other stations. Data
	and Geordi at aft stations. Picard is back in his
	travel clothes.

					GAINES
			Entering the Devron System, sir.

					RIKER
			All stop.

					DATA
				(off console)
			Sensors are picking up a small
			temporal anomaly off the port bow.

	Reactions.

					RIKER
			On screen.

	The VIEWSCREEN now shows a very small version of the
	ANOMALY seen throughout the show. Picard looks vastly
	relieved.

					PICARD
			I was right...

					GEORDI
				(off console)
			It's an anti-time eruption. It
			seems to have formed in the last
			six hours.

					PICARD
			We've got to stop it here... so it
			won't be able to travel back
			through time...

        STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT TEN       114.

109  CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			All right, Data -- we need a
			solution and we need it fast.

					DATA
				(off console)
			The anomaly is being sustained by
			the continuing tachyon pulses from
			the other two time periods. I
			suggest they be shut down.

					PICARD
				(serious)
			The next time I'm there, that's
			the first thing I'll do.

					RIKER
			Isn't there more we can do here...
			seal the rupture somehow?

					DATA
				(still working)
			I am investigating the options.

	As Picard MOVES toward Data, the SCENE CHANGES TO:

110  INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT

	Picard MOVING toward Geordi and Data at the aft
	consoles, as in Act Nine. (Note: Picard is at
	different locations in all three time periods, allowing
	for straight-cut transitions during the fast pace of
	Act Ten.)

					PICARD
				(quickly)
			Data, disengage the tachyon pulse.

					DATA
			Sir?

        STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT TEN       115.

110  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Just do it. The convergence of
			tachyon pulses from the three time
			periods is what causes the
			anomaly.

					DATA
			Aye, sir.

	Data works.

111  EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - PRESENT (OPTICAL)

	The ship holding position at the anomaly. We see the
	tachyon beam TURN OFF.

112  INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT

	As before.

					PICARD
			Report. Is there any change in
			the anomaly?

113  ANGLE ON DATA - PAST

	sitting at Ops.

					DATA
			No, sir.

	MOVE TO REVEAL:

114  INT. BRIDGE - PAST

	Picard in command. Data, Tasha, Worf, Troi, O'Brien at
	their stations.

					PICARD
			Disengage the tachyon pulse.

	The others exchange a look.

					O'BRIEN
			We haven't finished the scan, sir.

					PICARD
			I know that. But it's imperative
			that you disengage it immediately.

     STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT TEN 115A.        

114  CONTINUED:

					DATA
				(works)
			Aye, sir. Disengaging.

	Picard stares at the Viewscreen (not seen).

					PICARD
			Why isn't the anomaly affected?

					O'BRIEN
				(puzzled)
			Why would it be, sir?

	THE SCENE CHANGES TO:

        STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT TEN       116.

115  INT. BRIDGE - FUTURE

	Picard sitting in the command chair. Everyone else as
	seen before.

					PICARD
				(to all)
			I've shut off the tachyon pulses
			in the other time periods -- but
			the anomaly didn't change.

	This draws a few curious looks from the others -- but
	everyone now accepts that Picard is indeed travelling
	through time.

					DATA
				(off console)
			It remains unaffected here as
			well.

					BEVERLY
			What do we do?

					GEORDI
			The only way to stop this thing is
			to repair the rupture at the focal
			point where time and anti-time are
			converging.

					RIKER
			How do we do that?

					DATA
			It would require taking the ship
			into the anomaly itself. Once
			inside, we may be able to use our
			engines to create a static warp
			shell.

					GEORDI
				(onto the idea)
			Yeah, yeah... and the shell would
			act like an artificial subspace
			barrier -- separating time and
			anti-time...

					DATA
			Collapsing the anomaly and
			restoring the normal flow of time.
				(turns to Picard)
			But this would have to be done in
			the other two time periods, as
			well.

	Picard considers.

      STAR TREK: "All Good Things... "- REV. 03/17/94 - ACT TEN     117.

115  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			That could be a problem... the
			anomaly's so much larger in the
			other time periods...

	THE SCENE CHANGES TO:

116  INT. BRIDGE - PAST

	Picard finishing his sentence --

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			... It could be dangerous to take
			the ship in.

	Everyone looks at him.

					O'BRIEN
			Take the ship in where, sir?

	Picard takes a beat, then makes a decision.

					PICARD
			Into the anomaly, Chief. Lay in
			a course to the exact center.
			Transfer all available power to
			the shields.

	Shocked reactions around the Bridge.

					TASHA
			Sir... can you give us some
			explanation?

					PICARD
			No. I cannot.

					TASHA
			Captain, so far we've obeyed every
			order -- no matter how far-fetched
			it might have seemed. But if
			we're to risk the safety of the
			ship and crew... I think we have
			to ask you for an explanation.

	Picard looks around at the crew, which is staring
	intently at him, waiting to see how he'll handle this.

      STAR TREK: "All Good Things... "- REV. 03/14/94 - ACT TEN     118.

116  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			I know all of you have doubts
			about me... about each other...
			about the ship. All I can say is
			that even though we've only been
			together for a short time... I
			know that you are the finest crew
			in the fleet... and I would trust
			each of you with my life.
				(beat)
			I'm asking you to make a leap of
			faith -- and trust me.

	A quiet beat on the Bridge... then suddenly everyone
	starts working. The team has come together at last.

					TASHA
			Shields up, maximum strength.

					WORF
			Boosting field integrity on the
			warp nacelles. We may encounter
			shearing forces once we enter the
			anomaly.

					DATA
			I am preparing to initiate a
			static warp shell.

					O'BRIEN
			Course laid in, sir.

					TROI
				(off armchair console)
			All decks report ready, Captain.

	Picard looks at his crew -- he's proud of them and it
	shows.

					PICARD
			Chief... take us in.

	The SCENE CHANGES TO:

117  INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT

	Picard at aft console command -- everything as before.
	Data turns to him from the aft console.


        STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT TEN       119.

117  CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Captain, I have an idea. If we
			take the ship to the center of the
			anomaly and create a static warp
			shell...

					PICARD
				(overlapping)
			... a static warp shell, it could
			repair the barrier and collapse
			the anomaly.

					DATA
				(surprised)
			Yes, sir.

					PICARD
			Mister Data, you're a clever man --
			in any time period.

	Picard moves down to the command area with Data and
	Geordi.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Lay in a course to the center of
			the anomaly. Prepare to initiate
			a static warp shell.

	As Picard moves, the SCENE CHANGES TO:

118  INT. BRIDGE - FUTURE

	As before.

					PICARD
			The other two Enterprises...
			they're on their way.

					RIKER
			Very well.
				(to con)
			Ensign... take us in.

119  EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - FUTURE (OPTICAL)

	The ship begins moving towards the anomaly... closer...
	closer...


        STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT TEN       120.

120  INT. BRIDGE - PAST (OPTICAL)

	As before. Tense. The crew is watching the ANOMALY on
	the Viewscreen -- it's getting closer.

					O'BRIEN
			We're entering the anomaly, sir.

					PICARD
			All hands brace for impact!

	The ship ROCKS violently. The lights FLICKER.

					TASHA
			The temporal energy's interfering
			with main power. Switching to...

	Another JOLT carries us to:

121  INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT (OPTICAL)

	The ship is ROCKING. The anomaly has almost FILLED the
	Viewscreen. Lights flickering on and off here, as
	well. People hanging on.

					GEORDI
			... auxiliary power. I'm having
			trouble keeping the impulse
			engines on-line! I've got power
			fluctuations all across the board!

					PICARD
			Maintain course and speed!
				(to Data)
			Mister Data, how long until we
			reach the center?

					DATA
			Another thirty seconds at least,
			Captain.

	The SCENE CHANGES TO:

				(urgent)
			Captain! Sensors are picking

	Everyone looks at the Viewscreen --

128  VIEWSCREEN - PAST (OPTICAL)

	which is filled with the roiling anomaly. But faintly
	through the energy, we can see the GHOSTLY IMAGES of
	TWO ENTERPRISES. The ships are drifting in the anomaly
	very close to each other -- in fact, they appear to be
	moving through each other. It's a startling sight.

129  INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT (OPTICAL)

	The crew watching the exact same image on their
	Viewscreen -- two Enterprises.

130  INT. BRIDGE - FUTURE (OPTICAL)

	This crew watching the same image on their Viewscreen,
	It's an awesome moment.

131  INT. BRIDGE - PAST (OPTICAL)

	As before.

					DATA
			Captain, It appears to be working.
			The anomaly is beginning to
			collapse. I think that --

					TASHA
				(suddenly)
			Sir -- the temporal energy is
			rupturing our warp containment
			system!

					WORF
			We must eject the core!

					PICARD
			No. We have to maintain the
			static warp shell for as long as
			possible!

	The ship SHAKES harder.


        STAR TREK: "All Good Things... " - 03/10/94 - ACT TEN       123.

131  CONTINUED:

					TASHA
			We're losing containment! I can't
			stop it, it's going to --

	Suddenly, the bridge is ENGULFED IS A BLAST OF FLAMES
	AND DEBRIS --

132  INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT (OPTICAL)

	On the Viewscreen, one of the ghostly Enterprises
	EXPLODES -- destroyed. Reactions.

					PICARD
				(quickly, to Geordi)
			Transfer emergency power to the
			anti-matter containment system!

	The ship starts SHAKING more violently than ever.

					GEORDI
				(working frantically)
			I'm trying, sir... but there's a
			lot of interference...

					DATA
				(off console)
			The warp shell is definitely
			having an effect, sir. The

					GEORDI
			The containment system's going --
			I can't hold it --

					PICARD
			Maintain position! Mister La
			Forge --

	Scene CHANGES TO:

133  INT. BRIDGE - FUTURE (OPTICAL)

	As before -- shaking out of control. On the
	Viewscreen, we see the second Enterprise EXPLODE.
	Reactions to the sight.

					DATA
			Both of the other ships have been

	At this moment, Q APPEARS standing next to Picard.
	He's wearing a GRIM REAPER's outfit, complete with
	scythe and hourglass.

					Q
				(calm)
			Goodbye, Jean-Luc. I'll miss you.

135  INT. COURTROOM (OPTICAL)

	Silence. Picard standing alone in a now empty
	courtroom. He's dressed normally, present-day age.
	Picard is a little disoriented by the sudden silence.
	After a moment, Q's floating chair drops down into
	frame. Q is dressed in his Judge's robes again. He
	studies Picard.

					Q
			The Continuum didn't think you had
			it in you, Jean-Luc... but I knew

	Picard looks at him.

135  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Are you saying it worked? We
			collapsed the anomaly?

					Q
			Is that all this meant to you?
			Just another spatial anomaly...
			just another day at the office?

					PICARD
			Q, did it work?

					Q
			You're here, aren't you? You're
			talking to me, aren't you?

					PICARD
			What about my crew?

					Q
				(mocking)
			"The anomaly... my crew... my
			ship." I suppose you're worried
			about your fish too. Well, if it
			puts your mind at ease, you've
			saved humanity once again.

	Picard regards Q briefly.

					PICARD
			Thank you.

					Q
			For what?

					PICARD
			You had a hand in helping me get
			out of this.

					Q
			I was the one who got you into it,
			Jean-Luc. That was the directive
			from the Continuum.
				(beat)
			The part about the helping hand...
			was my idea.

	Q shakes his head.

					Q
			You just don't get it, do you,
			Jean-Luc?
				(leans in to him)
			The trial never ends.

	He smiles patronizingly.

					Q
				(continuing)
			We wanted to see if you had the
			ability to expand your mind and
			your horizons... and for one brief
			moment, you did.

					PICARD
			When I realized the paradox...

					Q
			Exactly. For that one fraction of
			a second, you were open to options
			you'd never considered. That's
			the exploration that awaits you...
			not mapping stars and studying
			nebulae... but charting the
			unknowable possibilities of

	Picard smiles... overwhelmed with relief... he laughs.
	Troi and Worf exchange a puzzled look.

					TROI
			Is something wrong, sir?

					PICARD
			No, no... in fact, I think I'll go

			I cheat.

	Data's head snaps up in shock.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			I'm kidding.

	Data collects the cards and begins shuffling at normal
	speed. Beverly looks thoughtful.

					BEVERLY
			I've been thinking... about all

					GEORDI
			It sure goes against everything
			we've heard about not polluting
			the time line...

					DATA
			I believe, however, that this
			situation is unique.

	They all look at him.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			Since the temporal anomaly did not
			occur, there have already been
			changes in the way this time line
			is unfolding. The future we
			experience will undoubtedly be
			different from the one the Captain
			encountered.

					RIKER
			Maybe that's why he told us.
			Knowing what that future could
			bring... gives us a chance to
			change things now.

	He gives Worf a meaningful look.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			So that some things never happen.
