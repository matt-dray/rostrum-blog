SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship is in orbit around a red/brown planet.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 43917.4			The Enterprise has been given the			singular honor of hosting the			first face to face meeting between			the Federation and the mysterious			race of beings known as the			Legarans. We are in orbit around			Vulcan preparing to welcome aboard			the Federation ambassador that			has made this historic event			possible.2    INT. CORRIDOR	PICARD and RIKER are walking to the Transporter Room.	They are in dress uniforms.					RIKER				(slightly awed)			I can remember studying his career			in school... the treaty of Alpha			Cygnus Nine, the Coridan admission			to the Federation, the Klingon			Alliance...					PICARD			I met him once... Many years ago,			just briefly at his son's wedding.				(smiles at memory)			But I'll tell you it was quite			a moment for a young lieutenant.			Standing in the presence of such			history... I was a little			tongue-tied to be quite frank...					RIKER			You... tongue-tied?         STAR TREK: "Sarek" - REV. 3/15/90 - TEASER         2.2    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Indeed. After all, how does one			make small talk with a man who			has virtually shaped the			Federation...					RIKER			Is it true that he'll be			retiring after this mission?					PICARD			Unofficially, that's what I hear.			And what a crowning achievement			this will be to his career. The			benefits of relations with the			Legarans are incalculable.	They have arrived at the Transporter Room.3    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	There are FOUR CREWMEMBERS forming an honor guard on	either side of the transporter stage. They stand at	attention. O'BRIEN is at the console, as KI MENDROSSEN	(a human -- fifty-five, stocky, comp), and SAKKATH (A	Vulcan, early twenties) MATERIALIZE on the pads. They	step off.					MENDROSSEN			Ah... Captain Picard. I am Ki			Mendrossen, the ambassador's chief			of staff. This is Sakkath, his			personal assistant.					PICARD			Has the ambassador been delayed?            STAR TREK: "Sarek" - 3/5/90 - TEASER            3.3    CONTINUED:					MENDROSSEN			He will be joining us momentarily.			But first we must discuss some			matters of the utmost delicacy.	Picard and Riker exchange a quick look. What's going	on?					PICARD			By all means.					MENDROSSEN			To be frank Captain, the			ambassador is not a young man.			He tires easily.					SAKKATH			He is going to need a great deal			of rest to prepare himself for			the difficult job that awaits him.					MENDROSSEN			Which is why it's imperative that			he be allowed to conserve his			strength. I must request that			you dispense with any official			ceremonies you would normally			accord a visitor of his rank.					RIKER			We had planned for a ship's			concert this evening.					PICARD			Yes, I believe that the ambassador			is extremely fond of Mozart.	Mendrossen reluctantly shakes his head.					MENDROSSEN			I'm afraid it would be impossible			for him to attend. Upon his			arrival he will be taken directly			to his quarters where he will			remain in seclusion until we reach			Legara Four.					PICARD			You have my assurance that the			ambassador will not be disturbed			during our voyage.          STAR TREK: "Sarek" - REV. 3/6/90 - TEASER          4.3    CONTINUED: (2)	Mendrossen relaxes, an ingratiating smile.					MENDROSSEN			That's all we ask. Well, now...			that's settled. The ambassador			is waiting.	Picard nods to O'Brien who works his controls.4    TRANSPORTER (OPTICAL)	SAREK and his wife, PERRIN (a human) MATERIALIZE.	Sarek is indeed old, but immensely commanding. A	genuinely regal figure. Perrin is much younger -- about	Picard's age -- poised and charming, with an immediate	warmth about her.					PICARD			Welcome aboard the Enterprise			Ambassador Sarek.					SAREK			We come to serve.					PICARD			Your service honors us.					SAREK			Allow me to present she who is			my wife.					PICARD			Mrs. Sarek.					PERRIN			Please call me Perrin, Captain.					PICARD			This is my first officer,			Commander Riker.	Riker and Sarek exchange nods.					PERRIN			Captain, if you'd be so kind as			to show us to our quarters.					SAREK			I prefer to view the conference			room first.          STAR TREK: "Sarek" - REV. 3/6/90 - TEASER          5.4    CONTINUED:	Mendrossen moves closer to Sarek.					MENDROSSEN			Ambassador, I'm sure Sakkath and			I can handle all the necessary			details...					SAREK			I will examine it for myself.	An awkward moment as Mendrossen and Perrin exchange	a brief glance.					PERRIN			Dear, perhaps it would be best			if we settled in first.	Sarek silences her with a look.					SAREK			They worry about my health,			Captain. Too much.				(a beat)			You will take me to the conference			room, please.	And there's no doubt that he means it.					RIKER			If you'll follow me, sir.	Mendrossen and Sakkath close in behind Sarek as Riker	leads them out of the Transporter Room. Perrin looks	back and smiles at Picard in gracious apology.5    CLOSE ON PICARD	Things haven't gone at all the way he expected. He	doesn't look troubled, exactly -- only wondering...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                      STAR TREK: "Sarek" - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE            6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:6    INT. CONFERENCE ROOM	The room is currently dominated by a large bulky tank	about chest high containing a gaseous/liquid revolting	mixture. GEORDI, WESLEY, and a few SUPERNUMERARIES	are busily connecting a complicated series of pipes	and cables around the tank. There are a few pictures	on the walls and a generic table with chairs. Wesley	peers into the tank with disgust.					WESLEY			Are the Legarans really going to			sit in this stuff?					GEORDI			Well, I'm sure not.					WESLEY			Can you believe this smell?					GEORDI			What smell?	Wesley looks up in surprise. Geordi laughs and Wesley	gives him an abashed grin.					GEORDI			What can I say... to us it's a			slime pit, to them it's home.					WESLEY				(a little eager)			The environmental controls are			ready. What's next?					GEORDI			Why? Are you in some kind of			hurry?					WESLEY			I have... sort of a date.					GEORDI				(surprised)			With who?					WESLEY				(shy, but proud)			Ensign Dumont.            STAR TREK: "Sarek" - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE            7.6    CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(whistles)			That is one attractive lady. I've			got to admit I'm surprised.					WESLEY				(grinning)			What, that she'd go out with me?					GEORDI			No, that you had the nerve to ask			her. Way to go Wesley.	Sarek, Sakkath, Perrin, Picard and Riker ENTER. Sarek	walks to the center of the room, looks things over and	is immediately displeased. Sarek's attitude is	irritated and he seems to grow more agitated by the	moment.					SAREK			The room is not ready.					PICARD			No Ambassador. Commander La Forge			and Ensign Crusher are---					SAREK			The Legarans are very sensitive			in matters of protocol. You will			remove all furniture from the			room. The walls must be bare.					MENDROSSEN			I'm sure that by the time the			Legarans arrive, everything will			be set up according to our			specifications. Isn't that right,			Captain?					PICARD			Ambassador, please be assured that			everything will be ready by the			time the conference begins.					PERRIN			My husband and I have every			confidence in you, Captain.	Sarek continues to look over the room.         STAR TREK: "Sarek" - REV. 3/15/90 - ACT ONE         8.6    CONTINUED: (2)					SAREK				(voice rises slightly)			I have worked for ninety-three			years in preparation for this			meeting. It is vital that no			detail be overlooked.	Sakkath moves next to Sarek. As Sakkath looks at	Sarek, there is a subtle change in Sarek's demeanor.	He becomes more impassive, less irritated. The	interaction between Sakkath and Sarek should not be	immediately obvious.					SAKKATH			Perhaps we should allow these			gentlemen to return to their work,			Ambassador.					SAREK			That will be acceptable.	Sarek leads the way back out of the room with Sakkath	and Mendrossen. As he reaches the doorway Sarek pauses	and looks at the wall.					SAREK			These walls are too bright.	Sarek, Sakkath and Mendrossen EXIT.         STAR TREK: "Sarek" - REV. 3/15/90 - ACT ONE         9.7    OMITTED8    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship goes into warp.9    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard and Riker (now in standard uniforms) at Command	along with TROI. WORF at his station.					TROI			So what was the ambassador like?					RIKER			The way Mendrossen described him,			I expected him to be a frail old			man.					PICARD			I hope I'm that frail when I'm			two hundred and two. His aides			did seem a little overprotective,			didn't they?					RIKER			From what I could see, the			ambassador doesn't need to be			protected from anything.					PICARD			Nevertheless, we will honor Mister			Mendrossen's request and allow			Ambassador Sarek his privacy.				(beat, sighs)			I suppose they were foolish and			vain, my expectations of this			voyage. Sharing his thoughts,			his memories, his unique			understanding of the history he			has made...					TROI			Does this mean you're going to			cancel the concert this evening?					PICARD			No, the concert will go on as			scheduled. But it is a pity that			the guest of honor will be absent.        STAR TREK: "Sarek" - REV. 3/15/90 - ACT ONE        9A.9    CONTINUED:					RIKER			For all we know, the ambassador			might enjoy an evening's			entertainment...					TROI				(to Picard)			Why not ask his wife if she'd like			to attend?	Picard considers this for a beat. He nods.           STAR TREK: "Sarek" - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE           10.9    CONTINUED:					PICARD			I think that's an excellent idea.	Riker smiles in approval. Picard stands.					PICARD			The bridge is yours, Number One.	Picard heads for the turbolift.10   INT. GUEST QUARTERS	The door CHIMES. The blinds over the windows are	closed. As Perrin moves toward the door, we can see	that she looks very tired, almost exhausted. She	presses the control panel and the door slides open,	revealing Picard.					PERRIN			Come in, Captain.					PICARD			I hope I'm not intruding.					PERRIN			Not at all. But I'm afraid that			Sarek is in meditation at the			moment.					PICARD			Actually, I came to see you.	Perrin leads him into the room.					PERRIN				(lightly)			Why, how nice Captain. I so			rarely get visitors of my own.			Usually everyone wants to see the			ambassador.					PICARD			I find that hard to believe.	Perrin smiles at him warmly. She indicates a seat for	the captain and they both sit down.         STAR TREK: "Sarek" - REV. 3/7/90 - ACT ONE         11.10   CONTINUED:					PERRIN			These quarters are lovely.				(beat)			The ambassador and I were both			very pleased when we heard that			the negotiations would take place			aboard the flagship of the			Federation.					PICARD			The honor is ours.					PERRIN			My husband has followed your			career with interest. He finds			it to be satisfactory.					PICARD				(reacts with pleasure)			High praise from a Vulcan.					PERRIN			Ah, then you have had experience			with Vulcans, Captain. Some			people who expect an emotional			response often find Vulcans			quite cold when they are merely			being...					PICARD			Logical.					PERRIN			Exactly.					PICARD			I have come to extend my personal			invitation to you... and your			husband, if he is available, to			attend a Mozart recital this			evening.	And now Perrin's face really brightens in anticipation.					PERRIN			Mozart? That would be wonderful.			Any chance that they will be			performing the string quartet			number six?					PICARD			I'm sure it could be arranged.           STAR TREK: "Sarek" - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE           12.10   CONTINUED: (2)					PERRIN			It's a very tempting offer...				(looks over at door to				 adjacent room)			I doubt that the ambassador will			be able to attend, but I will make			it a point to ask him.	Picard stands and Perrin escorts him to the door.					PICARD			Well, then I hope to see you			tonight.					PERRIN			As do I.	Picard EXITS.11   CLOSE ON PERRIN	as she turns away from the door. Her face clouds	slightly as she moves toward the closed door to the	adjacent room.12   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS	Sarek is kneeling on a angled stool (like a computer	stool). His eyes are wide open, and his expression is	not calm and distant, but conscious and troubled.13   ANGLE ON DOOR	The door slides aside and Perrin ENTERS. The easy,	light manner that she showed to Picard is gone. This	is a deeply worried woman. She goes over to Sarek and	puts her hand on his shoulder. Sarek looks up at her.					PERRIN			You are still unable to meditate?					SAREK			It is of no importance.					PERRIN			It has eluded you for many weeks.	Sarek gets up, towers over his wife with a vague air of	threat.           STAR TREK: "Sarek" - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE           13.13   CONTINUED:					SAREK				(low)			I said, it is of no importance.					PERRIN				(not backing down)			You know I am right.					SAREK			My wife, you will leave me now.			I require solitude.	There is a beat of silence as Perrin considers	refusing. She thinks better of it, then EXITS. PUSH	IN on Sarek... and we see a flicker of turmoil within.14   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM	Geordi and Wesley are still working on the tanks. The	supernumeraries are no longer present. The pictures	and furnishings seen earlier have been removed.					WESLEY			The temperature in the tank is			now one hundred fifty degrees			Celsius.					GEORDI			Okay, lock it off.	Wesley works the control on the tank. He turns back to	Geordi and his tone of voice suddenly becomes somewhat	surly.					WESLEY			Is that it? Can I get out of			here?	And at first it just seems like kidding around...					GEORDI			What's your hurry? You don't			really think something's gonna			happen between you and Suzanne			Dumont...					WESLEY			At least I'm not spending the			night with a good book like some			people...           STAR TREK: "Sarek" - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE           14.14   CONTINUED:	And now slowly it begins to turn into something more...	with just an edge --					GEORDI			What's that supposed to mean?					WESLEY			Just what it sounds like.					GEORDI			You'd get more action out of a			good book than you'll ever see			on this date, I guarantee it...			she's not going to waste her time			with someone like you.	And now this is really getting nasty...					WESLEY			Someone like me?					GEORDI			She's way out of your league.					WESLEY			Since when did you become an			expert on women?					GEORDI			Compared to you, every man on this			ship is an expert on women.					WESLEY			At least I don't have to find my			women in the Holodeck!					GEORDI				(deadly)			What did you say?					WESLEY			You heard me!	Wesley shoves Geordi hard. Geordi looks like he's	going to take Wesley apart when...15   NEW ANGLE	Riker ENTERS. He looks at the two of them as they	glare at each other.           STAR TREK: "Sarek" - 3/5/90 - ACT ONE           15.15   CONTINUED:					RIKER			Something wrong?	They don't respond, but continue to stare at each	other.					RIKER				(edge of command in				 voice)			I asked a question.					GEORDI			No, sir. Nothing wrong here.					WESLEY				(to Riker)			May I be excused, Commander?	Riker nods and Wesley EXITS. Riker looks at Geordi and	his voice is a little less official.					RIKER			Anything you want to talk about,			Geordi?					GEORDI			No, sir.	Geordi returns to the tanks. On Riker's puzzled	expression...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                   STAR TREK: "Sarek" - REV. 3/8/90 - ACT TWO         16.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:16   INT. SHIP'S THEATER	The ship's concert has not yet begun, but	SUPERNUMERARIES are filing into the room. On stage,	a string quartet with DATA prominent among them, is	tuning up.17   OMITTED18   ON PICARD AND RIKER	as they ENTER and move to their seats.					PICARD			I noticed that Lieutenant Worf			put Ensign D'Amato on report...			for insubordination.					RIKER			D'Amato's been an exemplary			officer.	They sit. BEVERLY and TROI are seated nearby.					PICARD			Indeed he has. Look into it,			Number One.				(beat)			I assume work has been progressing			in the conference room?					RIKER			Yes, sir. I checked on Geordi			and Wesley a few hours ago.				(beat while he wonders				 whether to mention it)			For a moment there... I thought			that the two of them were actually			going to... hit one another.         STAR TREK: "Sarek" - REV. 3/6/90 - ACT TWO         17.18   CONTINUED:	Picard notices something o.s. and stands up.19   NEW ANGLE	including doorway. Sarek and Perrin have entered.	Mendrossen is behind them and Sakkath is close by	Sarek. Everyone in the theater stands.	FOLLOW THEM as they walk over to where Picard and Riker	are waiting.					PICARD			Ambassador Sarek, Perrin... on			behalf of my entire crew, welcome.	Picard and Perrin exchange a smile. Sarek notices	this.					SAREK			It was my wife's suggestion that			we attend... and it seemed an			ideal diversion.
