SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship is motionless in space.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log, stardate 45156.1.			Our mission to Mudor Five has			been completed and since our next			assignment will not begin for			several days, we are enjoying a			welcome respite from our duties.2    INT. TEN FORWARD	RIKER, DATA, and WORF are clustered around O'BRIEN and	a pregnant KEIKO (about eight months along). O'Brien	and Keiko have that proud-but-nervous look of	expectant parents. While Data are Riker are very	interested in Keiko's pregnancy, Worf looks	exceptionally bored.					O'BRIEN				(to Riker)			If it's a boy... Michael. After			my father.					KEIKO			Wait a minute... we decided on			Hiro, after my father.					O'BRIEN			We talked about this last night.					KEIKO			That's right, and we decided on			Hiro.					RIKER			Wait. I've got it. How about...			William. Now there's a name...			William O'Brien. That has a nice			ring to it.	That gets a few chuckles. Keiko laughs gently... then	she suddenly puts a hand to her stomach.        STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/14/91 - TEASER        2.2    CONTINUED:	Riker looks concerned but Keiko smiles at him.					KEIKO				(to Riker)			It's all right. He's just doing			somersaults.	She takes Riker's hand and places it on her swollen	belly.					KEIKO				(continuing)			Right... there!	Riker smiles at the sensation.					RIKER			He's going to be a hell of a			gymnast.					DATA				(to Keiko)			May I?	She nods and Data carefully puts his hand near	Riker's. Worf is so bored that he all but yawns as he	watches this occur. Data's expression is curious...	childlike. The child kicks again and Data reacts.					KEIKO				(weary smile)			If he's not turning, he's kicking			and punching. When I want to			sleep, he wants to wake up. At			this point, I just wish it were			over.	Data removes his hand.					O'BRIEN				(to Keiko)			Have to go -- I've got a			transporter simulation to run on			the bridge.       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/12/91 - TEASER       2A.2    CONTINUED:	He kisses his wife and then puts his hand on her	stomach.        STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/15/91 - TEASER        3.2    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(continuing, to unborn				 child)			Good-bye, Michael.	O'Brien smiles at Keiko with humor and then he EXITS.									CUT TO:3    INT. CARGO BAY	BEVERLY is talking to GEORDI near a large stack of	containers. This is a very large cargo bay and there	is a door similar to the one in the shuttle bay that	opens to space. This door is smaller and it is	currently closed. The containers are marked	"Hazardous" and Geordi has been checking over some	manifests on a PADD.					GEORDI			No.					BEVERLY			Come on, Geordi					GEORDI			No.					BEVERLY			Just try it once. It's not as			hard as you think. I'm telling			you... you'll be terrific.	Geordi's still reluctant, but she's wearing him down.	He glances quickly around the bay to make sure no	one's watching then starts to quickly sing...					GEORDI			"... I am the very model of a			modern major general, I've			information vegetable, animal and			mineral... "				(quickly embarrassed,				 to Beverly)			I can't do this! I can't sing in			front of people.					BEVERLY			Yes you can! That was terrific!				(she takes his arm)			Now you were a little off pitch,			but I think we can take care of			that...        STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/19/91 - TEASER        4.3    CONTINUED:	On Geordi's "get me out of this" expression...									CUT TO:4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	LIEUTENANT MONROE at conn, ENSIGN MANDEL at ops. Troi	is introducing three children to PICARD. The children	are: MARISSA, a painfully shy nine-year-old who looks	down at her shoes during the entire scene; JAY GORDON,	a very solemn, serious boy who looks Picard right in	the eye (he is a proper, polite boy who is eager to	please, rather adult); and PATTERSON, a lively six-	year-old with a winning smile and tons of energy.	Picard is a little ill-at-ease here... this is not	his favorite duty.					TROI			Captain, I'd like to introduce			the winners of the primary school			science fair. This is Marissa,			Jay Gordon, and Patterson.			They're here for their tour.					PICARD			Hello.	Marissa keeps staring at her shoes; Picard sees only	the top of her head. But --					JAY GORDON			How do you do?					PATTERSON				(a big voice)			Can we see the battle bridge?			And the torpedo bay?					PICARD			I'm afraid not.				(trying to make it				 sound fun)			But... we will be visiting both			the hydroponics and astrophysics			laboratories.	Patterson's face falls slightly: "Gee, what fun."					TROI				(to kids)			I'm sure you'll have a wonderful			time.       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/12/91 - TEASER       4A.4    CONTINUED:	They're not quite convinced, but Picard presses	onward.        STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/15/91 - TEASER        5.4    CONTINUED:	O'Brien ENTERS in the b.g. and goes to work at the aft	science station.					PICARD			Well. If you'll come with me...	He leads them to the forward turbolift and the four of	them EXIT. O'Brien and Troi exchange a look.					O'BRIEN			I'm not sure who to feel sorry			for... the captain or the kids.	On Troi's smile...5    INT. TURBOLIFT	The turbolift is MOVING. There is a beat of awkward	silence as Picard and the kids look each other over.	Picard tries to get things moving. He launches into	what we suspect is the same speech, year after year.					PICARD			I want you all to know that we on			the Enterprise are very proud of			the science fair winners.			Perhaps some of you will choose			to pursue a career in Starfleet.			I heartily urge you to do so.	He stops, looks at them. Marissa is still looking	down; the boys stare up at him, Patterson smiling, Jay	Gordon utterly serious, but they don't respond.					PICARD			Well, then. Ah... what did you			do for your science projects?					PATTERSON				(loudly)			I planted radishes in this			special dirt and they came up all			weird!					PICARD			I see. Very commendable.				(to Jay Gordon)			And you?       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/15/91 - TEASER       5A.5    CONTINUED:					JAY GORDON			An analysis of the life span of			the swarming moths of Gonal Four.				(with emphasis)			They only live for twenty hours.			Then they all die.        STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/14/91 - TEASER        6.5    CONTINUED:					PICARD			How interesting. And you --	But before he can get to Marissa, suddenly the ship	ROCKS SLIGHTLY and the turbolift STOPS. Picard and	the kids are surprised for a moment, but before they	can say anything the ship SHAKES VIOLENTLY. The	LIGHTS start to race by, indicating that the	turbolift is FALLING in the shaft.					PICARD				(urgent)			Hang on -- we're falling!	The top light goes OUT and the children SCREAM in	terror...6    INT. CARGO BAY	Beverly and Geordi are shaken violently...7    INT. TEN FORWARD	People react in alarm as tables, chairs, and glassware	are shaken...8    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	The violent shaking STOPS and the bridge crew tries to	sort things out for a moment. Lieutenant Monroe tries	to take charge as she climbs to her feet near the conn.					MONROE			What happened?					MANDEL				(reading console)			Sensors are picking up subspace			distortions and high-energy			particles directly to starboard.	Monroe looks at the readings at the conn.					MONROE			Looks like we ran into a quantum			filament.				(to O'Brien)			Damage report?        STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/15/91 - TEASER        7.8    CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(reading aft science				 console}			We've lost primary life-support.			Switching to secondary systems.			Impulse and warp engines are offline.					MANDEL				(urgent)			There's another filament moving			toward us, sir!					MONROE				(urgent, to com)			All decks brace for---	She is cut off as the ship is VIOLENTLY SHAKEN.

MAIN BRIDGE	The Red Alert lights continue to blink on the darkened	bridge. For a moment there is only the sound of	crackling circuitry from the exploded conn console...	then a few moans as people start to come to. O'Brien	manages to stand and hit a button on one console...	then the bridge is dimly illuminated by emergency	lights. He helps Troi to her feet.					O'BRIEN			Counselor?					TROI				(a little shaky)			I'm all right.	Mandel groans on the deck near ops. Troi helps him up	as O'Brien starts to check some consoles.					TROI				(to com)			Medical team to the bridge.	No response. Troi frowns and hits her communicator.					TROI				(continuing)			Troi to sickbay.				(beat)			Troi to engineering.				(beat)			Counselor Troi to any crewmember,			please acknowledge.	She looks over at O'Brien, who looks helplessly at	several blank screens.					O'BRIEN			The computer's down, looks like			we still have impulse power...			but not much else...	Mandel gets to his feet and starts to check the three	turbolifts.       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT ONE       8A.9    CONTINUED:					TROI				(looks around)			Where's Lieutenant Monroe?       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/15/91 - ACT ONE       9.9    CONTINUED:	O'Brien looks around the bridge, and then spots a body	lying near the conn console.					O'BRIEN				(indicates body)			Counselor...10   ON TROI AND O'BRIEN	O'Brien kneels and turns the body over; it's Monroe.	He checks the arterial pulse, then shakes his head.11   OMITTED11A  NEW ANGLE	As Mandel tries to key the panel next to the forward	turbolift.					MANDEL			The turbolifts aren't working.				(beat)			We're trapped up here.	On their reactions...									CUT TO:12   INT. TURBOLIFT	CLOSE ON Picard. He's unconscious, lying on his right	side with his right leg awkwardly folded underneath	him. From o.c. we hear the sound of children softly	crying. He begins to wake up and we MOVE TO REVEAL	that he's still in the turbolift. There are a couple	of emergency lights, but it's still pretty dark.	Marissa, Jay Gordon, and Patterson are huddled	together, watching Picard. Patterson is crying, Jay	Gordon is silent and withdrawn, and Marissa is	trembling.					PICARD				(very hoarse)			Are you...				(tries to clear throat,				 then louder)			Are you children all right?       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/15/91 - ACT ONE       10.12   CONTINUED:	The children just stare at him, too scared to speak.	Picard tries to sit up... then lets out a painful	grunt as he moves his right leg, which causes the	children to flinch slightly. Picard moves more	gingerly and manages to get to a sitting position.	He carefully moves the leg to a comfortable angle.	Picard hits his communicator.					PICARD			Picard to bridge.				(beat)			This is the captain. Can anyone			hear me?	A beat.					PATTERSON			Why don't they answer?					PICARD			I don't know.					JAY GORDON			They're all dead.					PICARD				(firm)			They're not dead. Communications			are down, that's all.	He looks at the three tremulous faces staring at him.	They're trying, but they are little and scared.	Patterson is snuffling, about to lose it again;	Marissa looks like she could break down any second.	Jay Gordon is pale and remote, having accepted doom as	the only possible outcome.					JAY GORDON			We're going to die, too.					PICARD			We most certainly are not --	But this pronouncement has set Patterson off. He	bursts into tears and Marissa gulps, ready to sob.	Picard needs to get them under control and he puts all	his command presence into his voice and tries to take	charge.					PICARD				(firm)			Listen to me!       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT ONE       11.12   CONTINUED:	They fall silent and look at him.					PICARD				(continuing)			No one is going to die. The			bridge will send a rescue party			as soon as possible, so I want			you to stop crying. Everything			is going to be all right.	The children look at him. It seems like Picard has	finally managed to get things under control... then	all three kids start crying again, even louder this	time. Picard will have to find some other way of	dealing with them.									CUT TO:12A  INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Troi and O'Brien are at the aft science station. The	console is mostly blank except for one or two	displays. Monroe's body has been moved off the	bridge.					O'BRIEN				(working console)			This is the Federation Starship			Enterprise calling any vessel			within range. We are in distress			and need assistance. Please			respond.				(beat, then to Troi)			I'm still not sure we're even			transmitting. I'll set the			message on auto-repeat and see if			we get a response.	A sudden METALLIC NOISE from the aft turbolift (not	the same one Picard used) gets their attention. They	watch as the turbolift doors start to slowly open in	a jerky, stop-start motion.12B  ON TURBOLIFT (FORMERLY SCENE 11)	As the doors part slowly to reveal ENSIGN RO. She is	standing on the roof of a turbolift car that is	stalled just below the bridge and she is slowly	opening the doors by using an emergency hand crank.       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/14/91 - ACT ONE       12.12B  CONTINUED:					O'BRIEN				(helps her out)			Are you all right?	She steps onto the bridge.					RO			I'm alive. What the hell			happened?					O'BRIEN			We were hit by a quantum			filament. Most of our systems			are down and we haven't been able			to contact anyone off the bridge.					RO				(indicates turbolift)			Well, don't count on leaving			through there. An emergency			bulkhead closed just beneath that			lift.					O'BRIEN				(nods)			Confinement mode.					RO			Right. Isolation protocol.	Troi tries to remember, but she's not sure what	they're talking about.					TROI			I'm... not really familiar with			that protocol.					O'BRIEN				(to Troi)			If the computer senses a hull			breach, it automatically closes			emergency bulkheads to isolate			the breach. Until we can clear			those bulkheads, we'll be cut-off			from the rest of the ship.					MANDEL				(reading the ops				 console)			I've got partial sensors back on-line.       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/14/91 - ACT ONE       13.12B  CONTINUED:	They move to ops and Mandel points at something on the	console.					MANDEL				(continuing)			I'm picking up sporadic life-signs			throughout the saucer section. 			There are definitely survivors.								O'BRIEN			What about Ten Forward?				(beat)			My... wife is there.	Mandel checks the console again.					MANDEL			I'm sorry, Chief, but the			readings aren't that specific.	O'Brien tries to put his personal feelings aside for	the moment.					RO				(to Mandel)			Can you scan the drive section?	Mandel works for a moment... then grimly relays the	news he sees on the console.					MANDEL			I'm not reading any life-signs in			the drive section.	Everyone reacts.					RO			Could the sensors be			malfunctioning?					MANDEL				(works)			There's no way to know. Without			the main computer, I can't run a			diagnostic.					O'BRIEN				(to Troi)			Can you sense anything,			Counselor?      STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT ONE      13A.12B  CONTINUED:	Troi takes a deep breath... tries to clear her mind	for a moment. After a beat...					TROI			There are a lot of people still			alive... many of them are hurt...			but I can't tell where they are.	After a beat, Ro tries to get things moving.					RO			We need to start emergency			procedures. Who's the duty			officer?					O'BRIEN			Lieutenant Monroe was in command,			but he's dead.	There is a beat as O'Brien realizes what that means.	There hadn't been a chance to consider this question	before now.					O'BRIEN				(continuing)			I believe Counselor Troi is the			senior officer on the bridge.       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT ONE       14.12B  CONTINUED:	They all look at Troi. This isn't something she'd	expected.					RO			Counselor Troi?					O'BRIEN			She carries the rank of			Lieutenant Commander.	Ro doesn't say anything more, but her doubts about	Troi are clear. Troi takes a beat as she realizes	that she's now in charge. Everyone is looking at	her... waiting for orders.					TROI			I'd appreciate... some			suggestions.					O'BRIEN			I recommend we initiate emergency			procedure alpha two.				(off her look)			By-pass computer control and			place all systems on manual			override.					TROI			Very well.					O'BRIEN			Aye aye, sir.	He goes to the engineering console and starts to pull	off an access panel.					RO				(to Troi)			May I suggest that our next			priority be to stabilize life-			support and try to reestablish			intership communications.					TROI			Yes.				(beat)			Mister Mandel, I'd like you to			assist Ensign Ro.					MANDEL			Yes, sir.       STAR TREK: "Disaster" - REV. 8/12/91 - ACT ONE       15.12B  CONTINUED:	Mandel and Ro go to work.
