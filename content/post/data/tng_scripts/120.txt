WORF	turns from his Aft Station.					WORF			Captain! Communication from			Starfleet. They have recorded			a disturbance in the Neutral Zone.2    REACTIONS					PICARD			What is the nature of the			disturbance?					WORF			A battle. Quadrant nine --			coordinates zero-seven-zero, mark			three. No information who is			involved. They are asking if we			can investigate.					PICARD			Answer "affirmative."				(to Geordi)			Lieutenant La Forge, lay in the			course.					DATA			Captain, I have no reports of any			Federation ships in that area.					RIKER			Ferengi?					PICARD			It's a little out of their area.     STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - REV. 1/14/88 - TEASER     2.2    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Should we separate the saucer?					PICARD			Let's get some more information			first.					GEORDI			Course set.					PICARD			Speed -- warp seven.					GEORDI			Warp seven. Aye.					PICARD			Engage.3    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it warps towards us.4    INT. MAIN BRIDGEIt's very tense. Worf at Science; Data at Ops; Picard --alert, watching.					GEORDI			We are approaching the Neutral			Zone.					TASHA			Sir... Sensors indicate several			recent photon explosions and heavy			phaser activity.					DATA			I have analyzed the residue of			the explosives. They are not of			any known Ferengi design. It is			possibly Romulan.	Picard REACTS.       STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - TEASER       3.4    CONTINUED:					PICARD			That's a name we haven't heard			for a while.					RIKER			And I could have gone a lot longer			without hearing it.					PICARD			If the Romulans have returned to			this sector we should know about			it.					RIKER			Shall we move to the Battle			bridge?					PICARD			Not yet. Worf, any further			activity?					WORF			Negative, sir.					PICARD			Slow to half impulse.					GEORDI			Slowing to one-half impulse.5    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship comes out of warp speed.6    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Everyone is tense and expectant.					GEORDI			Entering quadrant nine-zero-seven,			mark three.					PICARD			Shields and deflectors up.					DATA			I have located a ship. It is			drifting.     STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - REV. 1/15/88 - TEASER     4.6    CONTINUED:					PICARD			On the Main Viewer.					DATA			Aye, sir.7    ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	There is a distant ship.					PICARD			Magnify!	The IMAGE on the Screen INCREASES in size. It is now	possible to see extensive battle damage.					DATA			The life-support systems on the			ship are failing, propulsion,			navigation, and all			communication, inoperative.					PICARD			Any trace of the other ship?					DATA			None, sir.					RIKER			If it is a Romulan vessel, it			could be cloaked.					PICARD				(to Worf)			Send this to Starfleet. We are			entering the Neutral Zone.				(to Geordi)			Get us in a little closer, Mister			La Forge. Stay sharp everyone.8    OMITTED9    INT. MAIN BRIDGE - TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	which displays THE BATRIS. Everyone studies the damaged	vessel as the Enterprise moves around it.       STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - TEASER       5.9    CONTINUED:					RIKER			It's Talarian.					PICARD			Any life signs?					WORF			Nothing yet.	There is a lot of tension.					DATA			I have identified the vessel.			It is the Batris. A general			cargo vessel.					RIKER			Long way from home.					PICARD			Stay sharp. If this is a result			of a Romulan attack, they could			still be in the area.					WORF			Captain. Possible life signs.					PICARD			What do you mean "possible?"					WORF			I cannot be positive. The			readings emanate from a location			near what is left of Main			Engineering. There is a great			deal of magnetic and radioactive			clutter making a positive			determination difficult.					RIKER			I'll prepare an away team.					PICARD			Lieutenant Yar, remain at your			post. Whoever attacked the			freighter may still be in the			area.					TASHA				(reluctantly)			Aye, sir.       STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - TEASER       6.9    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			Data, Geordi. Let's go.					PICARD			Lieutenant La Forge, are we close			enough to use the Visual Acuity			transmitter?					GEORDI			We can try it, sir.					PICARD			Then please do. And Number One -			everything about this seems wrong.					RIKER			Agreed. It smells like a trap.	And they DEPART.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - REV. 1/14/88 - ACT ONE    7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:10   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it slowly APPROACHES the other ship.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 41503.7.			We have entered the Neutral Zone.			A Talarian freighter has been			severely damaged in a battle.			Why, and with whom is unknown.			Personal note: I hope this event			is not a precursor of things to			come, and that the peace which			has endured for the last several			decades will continue.11   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM	Riker, Data and Geordi have gathered and are preparing	to beam over. A check of equipment. Geordi clips on	the transmitter for his VISOR.					RIKER			What exactly does that device do?					GEORDI			Data and I have been working on			a way to transmit what my VISOR			sees. If it works, the bridge			will be able to monitor us.					DATA			It is very restricted. The signal			from Geordi's VISOR is so complex			that it is difficult to encode			and breaks down easily.					RIKER			That means it doesn't have much			range.					GEORDI			Correct. The effective range is			a few kilometers, but we're			working on that.				(touches communicator)			Bridge, this is Lieutenant La			Forge.       STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE       8.11   CONTINUED:					WORF'S COM VOICE			This is the bridge.					GEORDI			I have attached the Visual Acuity			Transmitter.					WORF'S COM VOICE			We are receiving.					GEORDI			I am switching off.12   ANOTHER ANGLE	as they gather on the Transporter Pad.					RIKER			Set phasers on stun.	They all check their weapons.					RIKER				(continuing)			Let's be ready for anything.	He takes a quick, final look at his team.					RIKER				(continuing; to the				 TRANSPORTER CHIEF)			Energize.13   INT. BATRIS - CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)	The corridor is very DIMLY LIGHTED. There is evidence	of the recent battle everywhere. Charred walls -	damaged bulkheads. The transporter effect brings the	away team INTO THE SCENE. They are very tense. Data	scans with his tricorder as the others look around.14   GEORDI	steps slightly to the side.					GEORDI			La Forge to Enterprise.       STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE       9.15   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard on the bridge.					PICARD			This is the Enterprise.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Captain, I am switching on the			transmitter.					PICARD			Ready to receive.				(to the bridge crew)			Put this on the Main Viewer.	He leans forward as the IMAGE COMES ON the Screen.	For the first time, Picard sees as Geordi sees.	(Pattern and image to be determined.)					PICARD			Extraordinary.16   INTERCUT	The other members of the bridge crew as they, too,	REACT with astonishment.					PICARD			I understand him better than I			ever have.17   MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	Geordi's VISIONS. (TBD)18   ANGLE ON PICARD (OPTICAL)	For a moment all else is forgotten as he is consumed	by the image on the Main Viewer.					PICARD			Geordi. What was that? Over to			the left.	Geordi looks to the left.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			What?      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE      10.18   CONTINUED:					PICARD			That -- right there? No -- back.			Yes. That -- right there. What			is it?					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			It's Commander Riker.					PICARD			To me it's just an undefined			upright form, standing in a wild			visual frenzy. Can you filter out			the extraneous information?					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			No, I get it all simultaneously.					PICARD			It's a jumble. How can you make			heads or tails of it?					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			I select what I want to see and			disregard the rest.					PICARD			How is that possible?19   INT. BATRIS - CORRIDOR	Geordi chuckles.					GEORDI			How, in a noisy room, can you pick			out one specific voice or sound?					PICARD'S COM VOICE			It's something you learn.					GEORDI			Exactly. It's something I have			learned. Does that make it			clearer?20   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard stares at the viewscreen, trying to accomplish	in minutes what took Geordi a lifetime to learn.    STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - REV. 1/14/88 - ACT ONE    11.20   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Yes. Look over at Data.	Geordi complies and WE SEE the difference between them	from Geordi's point of view.					PICARD				(continuing)			There's an aura around Data.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Yes, of course. He's an android.21   INT. BATRIS - CORRIDOR	Data and Riker are getting impatient with this	conversation.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			From the way you say that, you			must think we all see it.					GEORDI			Don't you?					RIKER			Captain - I don't mean to break			this up, but...					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Yes, of course, Number One.			Proceed.	Riker leads the away team down the corridor.					DATA			I am detecting high levels of			Deuterium gas. Probably coming			from the leakage in the drive			system.					RIKER			Toxic?					DATA			Not as yet.      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE      12.22   OMITTED23   INT. BATRIS - ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR	As the members of the Enterprise move forward, the	damage becomes move extensive. They pause at an	intersection.					DATA			The life signs are emanating from			the far side of Engineering.					RIKER			What's the safest way around?					DATA			All routes are equally dangerous.					GEORDI			Which one is the least dangerous?					DATA			There is no significant			difference.					RIKER			Then steady on.	Geordi notices something.					GEORDI			Commander, a fissure is developing			in the bulkhead. The skin of the			ship is losing its integrity.					RIKER			Where? I don't see it.					GEORDI			There.	Riker looks, but still cannot see anything except the	charred bulkhead.24   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard is standing in front of the Main Viewer.					PICARD			Step closer.	Geordi complies.      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE      13.24   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(continuing)			It looks to me like a spectrograph			indicating metal fatigue. Is that			how you interpret it?					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Correct, Captain.25   INT. BATRIS - CORRIDOR	Riker steps up beside Geordi.					RIKER			How long before the hull ruptures?					GEORDI			Impossible to be exact. Five			minutes -- probably less.					RIKER			Come on.25A  ANOTHER ANGLE	They move forward into the DARKENED corridor toward	the WHITE GLOW coming from what was the Engineering	Section of the Batris.25B  INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY SCENE 35)	as Picard watches Geordi's POV, his IMAGE BREAKS UP,	then GOES OUT.					PICARD			I've lost the transmission.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Signal overload. I'm surprised			it lasted this long.26   INT. BATRIS - MAIN ENGINEERING	As the away team COMES to the entrance. All except	Data cover up against the heat and INTENSE LIGHT.      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE      14.27   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	as Picard and the others on the bridge listen to what	is happening on the Batris.28   INT. BATRIS - MAIN ENGINEERING	Data makes a sweep with his tricorder.					DATA			The life signs are very strong			now. They are coming from over			there.					RIKER			Is there any other way around?					DATA			Negative. This is the only way.			I think the safest way to proceed			is for me to cross alone. The			heat and toxic gases have less			effect on me.					RIKER			Agreed.29   ANOTHER ANGLE	as Data walks through the maelstrom.30   ANGLE ON RIKER AND GEORDI	They watch Data DISAPPEAR through the wall of heated	gases.31   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard listens.32   INT. BATRIS - MAIN ENGINEERING	Riker and Geordi wait impatiently.33   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	As Picard listens.      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE      15.34   INT. BATRIS - MAIN ENGINEERING	What Picard saw was Data RETURNING. He pauses halfway	across the Engineering compartment.					DATA			I found them. The door to their			compartment is jammed.	One by one they cover up from the intense heat and	SPRINT ACROSS the Engineering section.35   OMITTED36   INT. BATRIS - CORRIDOR	They arrive in front of the sealed compartment. The	damage here is more severe. Torn pieces of bulkhead	block the door to the compartment.					DATA			The control mechanism. It is			inoperative.	Riker squeezes his arm through a twisted piece of metal	and pounds on the door.					RIKER			This is Commander Riker of the			USS Enterprise. Can you hear me?	There is no response.					DATA			I advise against the use of			phasers. The gas buildup is too			great, Commander.					GEORDI			Yes. A phaser discharge now could			blow us all out of here.	They BACK OFF.37   OMITTED38   INT. BATRIS - DOOR TO AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM	Data clears the doorway of debris.    STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - REV. 1/14/88 - ACT ONE    16.39   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard is frustrated at no longer being able to see	what's happening to the away team.					PICARD			What's going on?					RIKER'S COM VOICE			We are about to force the door.40   INT. BATRIS - DOOR TO AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM	as Data steps closer to the door. With considerable	difficulty he wedges one hand in between the sliding	door panels. Then slowly he gets the other hand in	place. Data, now with both hands in between the door	panels, puts his great strength to work again, and	slowly pries the doors APART.41thru	OMITTED4243   ANOTHER ANGLE	As soon as there is enough of an opening, both Riker	and Geordi put their shoulders to the job, and between	them all the door is OPENED. Riker STEPS THROUGH.44   INT. BATRIS - ENGINEERING COMPARTMENT	As Riker ENTERS the room he sees TWO BLURRED FIGURES.	The first steps forward. It's dreamlike. A figure	looms out of the DARKNESS. A very tall, very fierce	KLINGON.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			What is it? What are you seeing?					RIKER			Klingons.45   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard REACTS to this new twist.      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT ONE      17.45   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Klingons.	Worf REACTS.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT TWO      18.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:46   OMITTED46A  INT.

BATRIS - ENGINEERING COMPARTMENT	The Klingon, KORRIS, moves forward to begin formalized	greetings.					KORRIS			I am Korris.					RIKER			We'll handle the formalities later -			right now we have to get off			this ship. Are there any others			still alive?					KORRIS			No.	Data APPEARS in the torn hatchway.					DATA			I believe there is a quicker way			out of here.					GEORDI			Let's go.	Riker indicates a third figure on the floor.					RIKER			Check him, Data.	Data steps over and scans the figure with his	tricorder.					DATA			He is alive -- but just barely.      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT TWO      19.47   CONTINUED:					RIKER			Pick him up and let's get out of			here.	Data starts to lift the stricken man. Korris steps up	beside Data.					KORRIS			No. I will carry him.					DATA			As you wish.47A  OMITTED48   INT. BATRIS - CORRIDOR	as the group hurries through the debris. There is a	BOILING, RUMBLING EFFECT on the ship.					GEORDI			We're out of time, Commander -- the			ship's going to blow.					RIKER			Transporter Room, have you got			a lock on us?					TASHA'S COM VOICE			Not yet. Too much interference.			You have to get farther away from			the Engineering section.	Behind them there is an ominous change in the GAS	BUILDUP.49   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Everyone watches the screen. Worf, from his Science	Station where he is monitoring the Batris:					WORF			Sir, the Engineering section is			at critical. Destruction of the			Batris is imminent.    STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - REV. 1/14/88 - ACT TWO    20.50   INT.

During the			course of the battle we must have			unknowingly entered the Neutral			Zone.					WORF			The weapons were not Ferengi.	Now the two Klingons turn their full attention on Worf.	It's a time for evaluation.					KORRIS			What is your name?					WORF			I am Lieutenant Worf.					KORRIS			And you are a member of this			crew?      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT TWO      23.59   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			Yes.	Korris pauses a beat, then continues.					KORRIS			You are correct. The weapons were			Klingon, but the vessel was			Ferengi.					PICARD			What precipitated the attack?					KORRIS			I don't know -- we were in our			quarters.					KONMEL			The captain of the freighter had			no combat experience so he did			not anticipate the first attack,			which was nearly fatal.					KORRIS			We took control -- with his			permission. The Ferengi called			for surrender. I told the captain			to agree to all their terms. We			had one chance -- I was confident			it would be enough.					KONMEL			As adversaries the Ferengi are			not very worthy.	Worf listens with relish to the story of the battle.					WORF			Still, your weapons were limited,			and their ship superior.					KORRIS			Yes -- all we had was an ancient			battery of Merculite rockets.			Our only chance was to trick them			into lowering their shields.					KONMEL			We reduced power and lured them			in.      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT TWO      24.59   CONTINUED: (3)					KORRIS			They suspected nothing.					KONMEL			Then, when they lowered their			shields to beam over a boarding			party, we opened fire.					WORF			Your strategy was very sound.					PICARD			There are still a few items that			are not clear.					KORRIS			Captain -- we are hungry and tired.					PICARD			Yes, of course.					KORRIS			If there is anything more you need			to know about this incident -- we			will be available.					WORF			Permission to show our guests to			their quarters, Captain.					PICARD			Permission granted.	Worf leads them OUT of Sickbay.					RIKER			What do you think, Captain?					PICARD			There's a lot more to this than			we've been told. Why was the			Talarian ship so far off course?			What was its point of departure?					RIKER			And why would three Klingon			officers hitch a ride on a broken-down			freighter?      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT TWO      25.59   CONTINUED: (4)					PICARD			Contact Starfleet -- find out what			they know about Korris and			company.					RIKER			It will take forty-eight hours			for a message to get to Starfleet			on subspace frequency.					PICARD			They are going to be with us for			a while; we might as well learn			all we can about them.					RIKER			Do you think I should have a			security team assigned to our			guests?					PICARD			No -- Worf is capable of dealing			with anything that may arise.				(to Beverly)			How's your patient, Doctor?					BEVERLY			Not good.

Korris takes	KUNIVAS' head in his hands and turns it toward him.	Kunivas opens his eyes and looks up. Korris leans	forward and with his thumbs he keeps the dying man's	eyes from closing. Korris leans even closer. Worf	is drawn to them.66   ANGLE ON WORF	with Beverly and Picard standing beside him, watching	the strange ritual.      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT TWO      28.67   ANGLE ON THE KLINGONS	It is intense, and very private. From one of the	three, or maybe from all of them, it's difficult to	tell, there comes a LOW RUMBLING GROWL as the moment	of death approaches. Then -- with a SHUDDER it happens.	The wounded man dies. For a beat, Korris continues to	stare into the dead man's eyes. Then, like an	explosion from the bowels of Valhalla -- the living	Klingons, including Worf, throw back their heads and	ROAR.67A  ANGLE ON PICARD AND BEVERLY	as they REACT to the ritual.68   OMITTED69   BACK TO SCENE	The three Klingons, shoulders touching -- faces skyward	-- fill the room with a SOUND which comes from deep	inside them. It is not the WAIL of the dead, but the	exaltation of the victorious. Then -- as one, they	stop. The looks they exchange between them are the	looks of men who have participated in a great and noble	victory.70   ANGLE ON PICARD AND BEVERLY	Both are awed by the ceremony.70A  KONMEL AND DEAD KLINGON	Konmel pauses by the dead Klingon -- as if to say a	final farewell. While no one is looking, he removes	the spike from his comrade's boot.71   BACK TO SCENE	It's QUIET.

Korris has escaped.					K'NERA			He is a trained Klingon warrior,			perhaps more than you can handle.			It is no disgrace to request our			assistance.					PICARD			I think we can handle the			situation.94   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING	Korris COMES BURSTING around the corner. Those on	duty REACT. Korris brandishes his weapon... They BACK	OFF, and he CONTINUES THROUGH -- past the Dilithium	Crystal Chamber. He PAUSES and looks around for a	position of advantage.94A  INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - ANOTHER ANGLE	Tasha and her team ENTER cautiously.94B  ANGLE ON KORRIS	He's found a ladder and is climbing to the second	level.94C  ANGLE ON TASHA	as she sizes up the situation.					TASHA			Captain. Korris is in Main			Engineering.95   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - ANOTHER SECTION	where Korris is barricaded. The phaser pointing	directly at the Di-Crystal Chamber.      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT FOUR      47.95   CONTINUED:					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Commander Korris. This is a			futile effort. You cannot win.	Korris does not respond, then:					KORRIS			I will speak only to my countryman			-- only to Worf.95A  INT. MAIN BRIDGE	REACTIONS from Picard and Worf to this demand.96   ANGLE ON TASHA	as she looks around to see where Korris is.					TASHA			Captain, he has a phaser aimed			directly at the Dilithium Crystal			Chamber. At that range, one blast			and...97   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Everyone's uncertain as to what to do next.					PICARD			I understand, Lieutenant.					WORF			Permission to leave the bridge,			Captain.					PICARD			We'll both go.	Worf and Picard LEAVE the bridge as the crew watches	him.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT FOUR                               STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT FIVE      48.                           ACT FIVE                             	FADE IN:98   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	ESTABLISHING.99   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING	as Worf and Picard APPROACH. Tasha has contained the	situation and cleared out all but her security force	who have been strategically placed.					PICARD			What's the siutation?					TASHA			He's on the second level. Armed			with a phaser. We do not have			a clear field of fire.					PICARD			How do you suggest we proceed?					TASHA			Wait him out.					WORF			Captain. May I speak with him?					TASHA			I don't think that's a good idea.			Right now he's running on			adrenalin. Let it cool. There's			no place he can go.					WORF			He will wait only as long as he			believes it is to his advantage,			the moment it is not, he will fire			his phaser into the Dilithium			Crystal Chamber.					TASHA			That would destroy the Enterprise			and him along with it.					WORF			Yes... he knows.      STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT FIVE      49.99   CONTINUED:	Picard is pensive for a beat.					PICARD			Talk to him, Worf.	Worf nods, and WALKS THROUGH Engineering toward the	Di-Crystal Chamber.99A  ANOTHER ANGLE	As Worf moves up beside the Di-Crystal Chamber, he	looks up and sees:99B  ANGLE ON KORRIS	He's perched on the second level. He has a clear field	of fire. Before another could reach him, he could	easily take out the Di-Crystal Chamber. He sees Worf.					KORRIS			Brother -- I knew you would come.99C  ANGLE ON WORF	He glances over to the ladder and walks toward it.	Korris continues to talk.					KORRIS			Now I... we have a chance.99D  ANGLE ON KORRIS	He relaxes slightly because now has has an ally.					KORRIS			I could not do it alone, but I			would rather die here, than let			the traitors of Kling pick the			meat from my bones. With you it			will work.					WORF			What will work?          STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT FIVE          50.100  BACK TO SCENE (OPTICAL)	as Worf nears the top of the ladder and swings onto the	catwalk.					KORRIS			I will demand Captain Picard give			us access to the Battle Bridge.			We will separate from the rest			of the ship, and together, we will			light up the galaxy. Imagine the			fear which will roll before us.					WORF			Captain Picard will not comply.					KORRIS			He cannot -- dare not -- refuse us.			In order to save themselves, they			will give us what we demand -- then,			brother, we are free.					WORF			Put down the phaser.	Korris is surprised.					KORRIS			Wait. I do not believe this.					WORF			Believe it.					KORRIS			I have tasted your heart. You			have been with them, but you are			still "of" us. Do not deny the			challenge of your destiny. Get			off your knees and soar. Open			your eyes and let the dream take			flight.					WORF			My brother, it is you who does			not see. You are looking for			battles in the wrong place. The			test of the warrior is not without --			it is within.	Worf touches his chest.          STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT FIVE          51.100  CONTINUED:					WORF				(continuing)			Here we meet the challenge. It			is the weaknesses in here the			warrior must overcome.					KORRIS			No.					WORF			You have talked of glory -- and			conquest -- and legends we will			write.					KORRIS			Yes -- the birthright of every			Klingon.					WORF			Yet in all you say, where are the			words -- duty -- honor -- loyalty.			Without which a warrior is			nothing.					KORRIS			What are you saying?					WORF			Put down the phaser.	Korris ignores the command -- as he continues to rail at	Worf.					KORRIS			Living among these humans has			sucked the Klingon heart out of			you. You are a sham. My words			were dust upon the ground. Your			blood has no fire -- you are weak			-- like them. I don't care what			you look like -- you are no			Klingon.					WORF			Perhaps not.	And without warning -- he BLASTS Korris. The phaser	is set on kill.101  ANGLE ON KORRIS	as he FALLS.          STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - 1/13/88 - ACT FIVE          52.101A ANGLE ON WORF	He REACTS.102  INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - PICARD, TASHA, SECURITYTEAM	Tasha and the others START TO MOVE FORWARD.					PICARD			Wait.	The security team FREEZES.103  ANGLE ON WORF	He steps over to Korris, leans down and takes the dying	Klingon's head in his hands and with his thumbs pries	open the eyes. For a long moment he stares into them.104  PICARD AND TASHA	as they watch the ritual.105  ANGLE ON WORF	After a beat, he leans back his head and ROARS a	warning to those who have gone before. A Klingon	warrior is coming -- beware.106  ANGLE ON PICARD	OFF his REACTION.107  OMITTED108  INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard and Worf EXIT the turbolift. As Picard takes	his Command Chair:					PICARD			Open hailing frequencies.					GEORDI			Hailing frequencies open.        STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - REV. 1/14/88 - ACT FIVE       53.108  CONTINUED:					PICARD			Commander K'Nera, this is Captain			Picard.	The image of the Klingon Commander COMES ON the	Viewscreen.					K'NERA			Yes, Captain.					PICARD			Korris and the other Klingon are			dead.					K'NERA			May I speak with Lieutenant Worf?	Picard motions for Worf to step forward.					WORF			Yes, Commander.					K'NERA			How did they die?					WORF			They died well.	K'Nera nods.					PICARD			Do you wish the bodies?					K'NERA			They are now only empty shells -			dispose of them as you see fit.				(to Worf)			Worf, when your tour of duty on the			Enterprise is complete -- consider			serving with us. Your training			and experience would be of benefit			to us -- and perhaps there are some			things we could teach you.					WORF			I will consider it. Thank you.	K'Nera nods and CLICKS OFF.        STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - REV. 1/15/88 - ACT FIVE       54.109  ANGLE ON PICARD	He REACTS with mild surprise at Worf's statement and	looks over at Tasha, who is also surprised.110  CLOSE ON WORF	Worf pauses for a beat, then replaces the crewman at	a Forward Position. As he sits, Worf senses the	tension, and hears the SILENCE. He slowly turns and	looks back at them.111  FULL SHOT	Picard, Riker -- and the rest wait for some explanation.					WORF				(to Picard)			I was just being polite, sir.					PICARD			Commendable, Lieutenant. Mister La			Forge, set course for Starbase			Eight-four.	Geordi taps in the information.					WORF			Really... I have no desire to			leave the Enterprise.	They continue to just look at him.					PICARD			Good.	Worf turns back to his console.					GEORDI			Course set.					PICARD			Speed -- warp five.					GEORDI			Warp five.					PICARD			... And Worf.	Worf turns and looks at Picard.        STAR TREK: "Heart Of Glory" - REV. 1/15/88 - ACT FIVE       55.111  CONTINUED:					PICARD				(continuing)			The bridge wouldn't be the same			without you.	A look between Worf and the others, who are in complete	agreement.					PICARD			Engage.	A very satisfied Worf turns back to his console as	Geordi engages the warp drive. Picard settles back	with a smile, as do all the others.112  EXT.
