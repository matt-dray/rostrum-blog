DS9 - PROMENADE - LOWER LEVEL	PICARD and BEVERLY come out of an AIRLOCK and begin	walking down the street, past the storefronts and	activity. Picard is carrying a briefcase; Beverly has	a medical kit. Mid-conversation.					BEVERLY			I should be finished with the			water contaminant analysis in a			few hours. Then I'm going to try			one of the Holosuites.				(beat)			I hear they've got a relaxation			program here from Alture Seven.			First you get bathed in a protein			bath... and then a cloud of			chromal vapor carries you into a			meditation chamber... You should			try it.	Picard sighs at the thought.					PICARD			I'm afraid I won't have the time.			I'll be too busy discussing the			finer points of water management			with ten Bajoran bureaucrats.				(beat)			And they won't be carrying me on			chromal vapor...	Beverly smiles. As they ENTER a TURBOLIFT...         STAR TREK: "Birthright" - 12/10/92 - TEASER         2.3    INT. REPLIMAT	WORF and GEORDI are moving away from the wall of	replicators, having just made identical plates of FOOD.	As they head for a table...					WORF				(re: food)			What is this?					GEORDI			Pasta al fiorella -- you'll love			it.	They sit down.					GEORDI			I'd like to take a look at those			Ktarian antiques...

SICKBAY	JULIAN BASHIR is by himself, working on a TECH DEVICE --	a large, battered-looking cylinder. The device has	been connected to a medical console with a small cable.	Data ENTERS and reacts to the sight of this strange man	in Sickbay.					DATA				(to Bashir)			Excuse me. Do you have			authorization to work in this			area?	Bashir glances at Data, missing the question,	completely absorbed in his work. He waves Data over.					BASHIR			Come here... come here... I need			a hand with this field			generator...	Data walks over. Bashir touches a control on the	cylinder, then indicates a medical console.					BASHIR			See if you can boost the power			output to sixty-five percent.	Data looks at the cylinder.					DATA			I am sorry. Use of Sickbay			equipment is limited to the ship's			medical personnel.	Bashir turns to Data -- offers him a hand.					BASHIR			Doctor Julian Bashir -- Chief			Medical officer, Deep Space Nine.					(MORE)      STAR TREK: "Birthright" - REV. 12/10/92 - TEASER      4.6    CONTINUED:					BASHIR (Cont'd)				(off Data's pips)			And you are Commander... ?					DATA			Data.	They shake hands. Bashir reacts to the name...					BASHIR			Commander Data... the synthetic			lifeform?					DATA			Yes.	Bashir smiles, delighted -- shakes Data's hand with	renewed vigor.					BASHIR			An honor to meet you, sir. I've			heard so much about you...				(beat)			You must have a fascinating			perspective on bio-cybernetic			research. I'd be delighted if we			could discuss the subject			sometime...	Bashir's charm catches Data off guard.					DATA			I would be happy to do so.			However, I must ask you to stop			your experiment.	A beat.					BASHIR			Yes, of course... you're right.			I realize I should have asked			before using your Sickbay.	Bashir disconnects the cylinder from the console.					BASHIR				(continuing)			It would've taken me days to			analyze this device with the			computer I have on DS Nine...	Data eyes the cylinder.      STAR TREK: "Birthright" - REV. 12/10/92 - TEASER      5.6    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			What type of device is it?					BASHIR			It was discovered in the Gamma			Quadrant. I think it may be some			kind of medical instrument.	Data examines the cylinder.					DATA			It appears to employ beam inputs.					BASHIR				(nods)			I'm hoping it's a medical scanner.			I want to use your computers to			find out how it works.	Beat.					DATA			I suggest we go to Engineering and			begin with a full circuit pathway			diagnostic.	Bashir smiles at the invitation.					BASHIR			Splendid.	Data lifts the cylinder. As they head for the door,	Bashir eyes Data with genuine curiosity.					BASHIR			I must admit, Commander... I			didn't think you'd be so...			personable.	Data gives him a look. As they EXIT...7    INT. DS9 - PROMENADE - REPLIMAT	Geordi and Worf are sitting at the table. Geordi's	plate is still full and pushed away from him. Worf	eats with enthusiasm.					GEORDI			I'll have to talk to Chief O'Brien			about the replicators.					(MORE)         STAR TREK: "Birthright" - 12/10/92 - TEASER         6.7    CONTINUED:					GEORDI (CONT'D)			I don't know how you can keep			eating it...				(beat)			It tastes like... liquid polymer.	Worf's plate is almost empty -- he's just finishing.					WORF			Delicious.	Geordi pushes his plate away, stands.					GEORDI			I think I'll try the kiosk on the			other side of the Promenade. It			looked like they've got real food.	Worf nods. Geordi walks off down the Promenade. A	beat goes by as Worf eats... then:					SHREK (O.S.)			Klingon... you are the Starfleet			Klingon.	Worf looks toward the voice. INCLUDE Shrek -- the	alien seen earlier. He is standing near Worf's table.					WORF			Yes... I am Lieutenant Worf.					SHREK			Worf... son of Mogh?	Worf eyes him warily.					WORF			What of it?	Shrek sits down at the table. He leans in close to	Worf, speaks in a low voice -- manipulative but	articulate.					SHREK			I am Jaglom Shrek. A man with			information to sell.					WORF			You have no information I could			want.					SHREK			I wouldn't be so sure...         STAR TREK: "Birthright" - 12/10/92 - TEASER         7.7    CONTINUED: (2)	Worf is growing annoyed -- he stands to go.					SHREK				(quickly)			It is about your father...

DEEP SPACE NINE - REPLIMAT	As before, Worf and Shrek. Worf is disbelieving.					WORF			My father is dead.					SHREK			He's not. I know where he is.					WORF			How is that possible?	Shrek leans back in his chair, eyes Worf shrewdly.					SHREK			I expect to be paid for my			information. Perhaps we can			negotiate an exchange. The			location of your father, for fifty			bars of --	Worf's temper flares -- he GRABS Shrek by the shirt.					WORF				(hard)			Tell me what you know.	Shrek is shaken, but determined to make a deal.					SHREK			Not all of the Klingons at			Khitomer were killed during the			massacre. Many were captured by			the Romulans... and placed in a			prison camp on a remote planet...				(beat)			Your father was among them.					WORF			Where is this planet?					SHREK			Not far from here... I can give			you the location... for a price.      STAR TREK: "Birthright" - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT ONE      9.8    CONTINUED:	Worf considers. He grows angry.					WORF			A Klingon would rather die than be			taken prisoner. I should kill you			for spreading lies about my			family.				(adamant)			My father was killed defending			Khitomer.	Worf lets go of Shrek, then storms off down the	Promenade. As Shrek watches him go...                                             CUT TO:9    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	docked at DS9.10   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE	Later. RIKER, TROI, N.D.s at their positions. Worf is	standing at tactical, looking agitated. A SECURITY	N.D. ENTERS from a Turbolift and crosses to Worf. He	hands Worf a PADD and turns to go. Worf reads it.					WORF				(to N.D.)			Ensign Lopez.	The N.D. turns to Worf.					WORF				(snaps)			This duty roster is unacceptable.			The assignments must be listed in			order of priority. Prepare it			again.	The hapless N.D. takes the PADD and stares down at it,	confused by the harsh command.					WORF			I will expect it no later than oh			nine hundred hours. Understood?	The N.D. nods, cowed, and quickly heads for a	Turbolift. Worf continues working. Riker walks up	behind Worf at Tactical.     STAR TREK: "Birthright" - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT ONE     10.10   CONTINUED:					RIKER			Worf, I'll need that rendezvous			schedule sent over to Commander			Rudman on the Merrimac as soon as			you --					WORF				(cutting him off)			I am aware of your request,			Commander.	Riker reacts to Worf's abruptness, a little taken	aback.					RIKER			Lieutenant... are you alright?	Worf calms himself -- knows he's made a mistake. He's	on edge, and it shows.					WORF			I am... fine, sir.				(beat)			I will send the schedule... Excuse			me, sir...	Worf heads for a Turbolift and EXITS. As Riker and	Troi exchange a concerned look...11   INT. WORF'S QUARTERS	Later. Worf is dressed in his workout uniform,	practicing his martial arts (as seen in "Man of the	People"). His motions are slow and deliberate at	first, as he tries to clear his mind... calming	himself...	Gradually, it becomes clear that he is having trouble	concentrating. His actions grow sharper and faster --	more violent with emotion. Finally, his anger flares	and he yells out, SMASHING his arm down onto a table,	SHATTERING it into several pieces.	He stands there a moment, breathless, staring at it.	The door CHIMES.					WORF			Enter.	The door OPENS and Troi comes in, takes in the scene --	sees the broken table.					TROI			Did the table do something wrong?     STAR TREK: "Birthright" - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT ONE     11.11   CONTINUED:	Worf is agitated.					WORF			No...					TROI			I'm glad you weren't that hard on			Ensign Lopez.					WORF			He made a mistake. The duty			roster was inaccurate.					TROI				(right back at him)			Would you like to talk about			what's bothering you... or would			you like to break some more			furniture?	Worf glances at the broken table and manages to calm	down a little. He takes a breath... this is difficult	for him to talk about.					WORF			Today on the Promenade... I was			approached by a Yridian. He knew			who I was... and tried to sell me			information about... Mogh.					TROI			Your father?	Worf nods grimly.					WORF			He claimed that my father is			alive... being held in a Romulan			prison camp.					TROI				(reacts)			My god... could it be true?	Worf begins to move about the room, restless, his	emotions stirring once again.					WORF			A Klingon would never allow			himself to be captured. A warrior			fights to the death.        STAR TREK: "Birthright" - 12/10/92 - ACT ONE        12.11   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF (Cont'd)				(beat)			If my father were alive... it			would dishonor his sons and their			sons for three generations...				(beat)			Even Alexander would bear the			burden of guilt.					TROI			So you're willing to ignore the			possibility... because you're			concerned about dishonor?	Worf's anger rushes to the surface.					WORF			My father is dead -- the Yridian			is selling lies!	Troi stares at him, unruffled.					TROI			If you're so sure of that... why			are you still upset?	A long beat. Worf doesn't have an answer.					TROI				(continuing)			Worf... you can't deny the			possibility just because you don't			want it to be true.	Worf is silent, fuming, struggling with his feelings	about the situation. Troi can sense that this isn't	going anywhere. She tries to comfort Worf.					TROI				(continuing)			If you want to talk about this...			you know where to find me.	Troi turns and EXITS. Worf is left to stare at the	broken table, Troi's words still hanging in the air...12   INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)	Data, Bashir and Geordi are examining the battered	cylinder seen earlier. Data indicates several input	ports on the cylinder.      STAR TREK: "Birthright" -REV. 12/11/92 - ACT ONE      13.12   CONTINUED:					DATA			If we transfer twenty megajoules			of energy from the dilithium			chamber into the plasma inputs, it			should be enough to activate the			device.	Geordi nods.					GEORDI			Sounds like it's worth a try.				(beat)			You two can start by connecting			the coil to the chamber. I'll			configure the energy transfer...					BASHIR			Right.	Data and Bashir move to the warp core. They begin to	connect a fiber optic cable to the cylinder. As they	work...					BASHIR			Data... may I ask you a personal			question?					DATA			Certainly.					BASHIR			Does your hair grow?	Data thinks a moment, taken aback by the question.					DATA			I can control the rate of my			follicle replenishment. However,			I have not yet had a reason to			modify the length of my hair.				(beat)			Why do you ask?					BASHIR			Just curious...	Bashir finishes connecting the cable to the cylinder.					BASHIR			Power conduits ready...      STAR TREK: "Birthright" -REV. 12/11/92 - ACT ONE      14.12   CONTINUED: (2)	Data connects the other end of the cable to the	dilithium chamber. Bashir opens a PANEL on the side of	the cylinder and starts to make adjustments to the	circuitry. Data kneels beside him to assist.	They work for a moment... then Bashir glances at Data.	Something about his face catches his attention. He	moves closer, staring directly at his nose. Data takes	note.					DATA			Is there something wrong, Doctor?					BASHIR			You're breathing...					DATA			Yes. I do have a functional			respiration system. However, its			purpose is to maintain the thermal			control of my internal systems.			I am, in fact, capable of			functioning for extended periods			in a vacuum.	Bashir nods, fascinated. He reaches over and feels	Data's wrist.					BASHIR			And you have a pulse...					DATA			My circulatory system not only			produces bio-chemical lubricants,			but regulates micro-hydraulic			power.	Bashir looks impressed. They work for a moment.					DATA				(intrigued)			Most people are usually interested			in my extraordinary abilities.			How fast I can compute, my memory			capacity, how long I will live.				(beat)			But no one has ever asked me if my			hair can grow, or noticed that I			can breathe.	Bashir smiles.     STAR TREK: "Birthright" - REV. 12/10/92 - ACT ONE     15.12   CONTINUED: (3)					BASHIR			Your creator went to a lot of			trouble to make you seem human...			I find that fascinating.	Data considers.
