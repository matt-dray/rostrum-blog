A BAR	It's a rough, wretched watering-hole, just the kind of	place you'd expect on a frontier world at the edge of	Federation space. The patrons are a hard and nasty	bunch -- if you're looking for trouble, this is a good	place to find it.2    TROI	is at the counter, speaking with the BARTENDER, a	large, intimidating male alien. Deanna is not in	uniform and instead is wearing clothes that look	perfectly normal in this place.	There's a teasing, insouciant quality to Troi -- the	bartender is attracted to her and she knows it; she's	using it.					BARTENDER			Tell me... why is it so important			that you find this man?	Troi smiles, hinting at mystery.					TROI			We had some business dealings...			he owes me money.					BARTENDER				(suggestively)			If we had business dealings, I can			tell you I wouldn't disappear...					TROI			Maybe we should discuss that			possibility. But first, I have to			find him... collect the money I'm			owed...					BARTENDER			Let me guess... you and your			friend were smuggling relics from			the ruins of Nafir...       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/27/93 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:					TROI				(maybe)			Mmmmmm...					BARTENDER			A dangerous game.					TROI			Maybe I like danger.	He eyes her for a moment, hoping that's an invitation.					BARTENDER			Then you've come to the right			place.				(leans toward her)			I'll be closing in a few hours.			Perhaps we can discuss this...			more privately.	Troi would rather have a tooth drilled, but she smiles	sweetly at him.					TROI			If I can't find him, I'll have to			move on. Are you sure you haven't			seen him?					BARTENDER			Human... two meters tall... smooth-headed...			no, I don't remember			anyone like that.	Troi eyes him.					TROI			You're lying...					BARTENDER			And you're Betazoid... I thought			so.	He leans in to her, speaks quietly.					BARTENDER			The people who come here count on			a certain amount of... anonymity.			If I started answering questions			about them... even to a very			beautiful woman... I wouldn't be			in business very long.	He sets another drink in front of her.       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					BARTENDER			As a businesswoman, I'm sure you			understand.	And he moves off, leaving a frustrated Troi.3    RIKER	is in another part of the room. He is with a group of	people who are in a raucous, merry mood. He laughs	heartily with them, presumably at a tale that has just	been told, claps one of them on the back, and	withdraws.					RIKER			Great story... I'll have to			remember that the next time I'm in			a knife fight...	He turns to encounter WORF, and the two move aside and	talk quietly.					RIKER				(continuing)			Any luck?					WORF			I think the one over there knows			something.	Worf looks casually toward a table in the background,	and Riker's gaze follows.4    YRANAC - THEIR POV	A sleazy male Yridian sits alone at a table, sipping a	drink and watching the scene around him furtively.5    BACK TO SCENE					WORF			He wouldn't admit to having seen			the Captain... but he said that			anyone who visited the ruins of			Nafir would probably come here			eventually... I suspect he knows			more.					RIKER			Let's go.       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       4.5    CONTINUED:	Riker moves immediately toward the table; Worf tries to	tell him something.					WORF				(loud whisper)			Commander -- I told him --	But Riker is out of earshot. Worf follows him to the	table where Yranac is sitting. The man looks up a bit	nervously as they approach and sit with him.					RIKER			My friend here tells me you might			know about the man we're looking			for.	Yranac's eyes dart around the room, as though checking	to see if he's being observed.					YRANAC			The only reason I'm talking to			you... is that I have a sister,			too.	Riker glances at Worf, puzzled.					WORF				(covering for Riker)			I explained to him... that we are			looking for the man who			impregnated your sister.	There is a brief beat as Riker looks at Worf, stifling	his response (is that the best story you could come up	with?); then he turns back to Yranac.					RIKER			You can imagine how much this			means to me.					YRANAC			Family honor is important... If			someone had defiled my sister...			I would do anything... pay			anything... to find the one			responsible.	Yranac's message is clear: he's selling this	information.					RIKER			I see. And just how much would			"anything" be?       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       5.5    CONTINUED: (2)					YRANAC			As much as... five bars of goldpress			latinum.	But before Riker can respond, a hand snakes around	Yranac's neck, pulling him up and off the chair.					BARTENDER			I think you've had too much to			drink. You'd better leave.	The patrons in the immediate vicinity glance at the	incident, and move away slightly. They're used to	these unpleasantries and don't want to get involved.					BARTENDER			On your way, Yranac.	Suddenly a phaser comes into frame and presses against	the bartender's head.					BEVERLY'S VOICE			I'm sorry... but I think he wants			to stay.	The bartender flickers his eyes toward BEVERLY, who is	also dressed in local clothes, and who holds the	phaser. The bartender lets go of Yranac.					BEVERLY				(to Yranac)			Sit down.	Yranac does. Beverly keeps the phaser trained on the	bartender. Riker leans in to Yranac.					RIKER			This --				(gestures to Beverly)			-- is my sister.				(beat)			She's angry.				(beat)			She has a vicious temper. I			wouldn't cross her.	Troi joins them and positions herself on the other side	of Yranac.					BARTENDER			You talk and you're a dead man,			Yranac.       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       6.5    CONTINUED: (3)	Yranac looks from one to the other, assessing. To	Riker:					YRANAC			Perhaps there is an element of			risk here that I did not fully			appreciate.					WORF			And how much more latinum will it			take to offset that risk?					YRANAC			This isn't about latinum.				(spreads his hands)			As a man with a sister -- a sister			with a temper -- I can sympathize			with you. But...				(beat)			How did you come here? Do you			have a ship in orbit?					RIKER			Yes...					YRANAC			Then take me with you. You can			drop me anywhere you like.	Riker and Worf exchange a look.					RIKER			Agreed. Now talk.	Yranac takes a breath.					YRANAC			The man you're looking for was			here several weeks ago. There was			a group of aliens sitting at this			table... he was asking them			questions.					WORF			Who were these aliens?					YRANAC			I don't know. But they looked			dangerous.				(beat)			They attacked him. He managed to			incapacitate three of them before			he was knocked down.       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       7.5    CONTINUED: (4)	He points to the wall behind him.					YRANAC			He was thrown against that wall...			and fell there.	Yranac points to a spot on the floor near the wall.	Beverly hands the phaser to Troi, who keeps it trained	on the bartender. She pulls out a tricorder and scans	the wall and floor.					BEVERLY			I'm picking up some Starfleet			fiber traces... and human cellular			debris.					RIKER			Can you establish a DNA sequence?	Beverly taps a few commands into her tricorder; she	looks puzzled.					BEVERLY			There's something strange here.			The cell structures are badly			distorted. It looks as if they've			been exposed to some kind of high			energy field.					WORF			A weapon discharge?					BEVERLY			It could be. There are faint			traces of micro-crystalline damage			in the floor material. But I'm			not familiar with the pattern.	Yranac stares at her. He's realizing this group is	other than what they seem.					YRANAC			Who are you people?					RIKER			You didn't say anything about a			weapon.	Yranac is beginning to look a little nervous.       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       8.5    CONTINUED: (5)					YRANAC				(quickly)			I hadn't finished yet. You'll			like this... the man got what was			coming to him. When they knocked			him down, one of them took out a			weapon... and fired.				(hoping this is wellreceived)			He was vaporized.	There's a moment of stunned silence. Yranac looks from	one to the other, anxiously awaiting their reaction.	Troi is staring intently at him. Then she turns to	Riker.					TROI			He's telling the truth.	Off their reactions...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE      9.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            6    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit.7    INT. SICKBAY	Beverly is staring at an OKUDAGRAM of a DNA sequence	displayed on the wall monitor. Riker ENTERS and	crosses to her.					RIKER			Doctor?	Beverly turns to him; her expression is grim.					BEVERLY			There's no question. It's Captain			Picard's DNA.	Riker is impassive, his expression unreadable, but it's	all Beverly can do to keep from breaking down. It's	hard for her to admit it to herself; she desperately	wants to find some indication she's wrong, but she	knows she isn't.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			I used a multi-base progression to			regenerate the DNA. The technique			is practically flawless...	She continues to give her report, attempting to	submerge her feelings in her work.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			The cellular damage could have			been caused by a variety of energy			fields... it's hard to be			specific. I can't tell whether it			was the field itself that killed			him or if he was already dead			when...	She trails off, unable to continue. Riker wants to	comfort her, but there isn't much to say.   STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - REV. 07/27/93 - ACT ONE   10.7    CONTINUED:					RIKER			I'll need your analysis for my			report to Starfleet.	She hands him a PADD.					BEVERLY			It's all here.					RIKER			Thank you.				(beat)			I'll inform the crew.	Riker EXITS. Beverly returns to her work, trying to	maintain her composure in the face of this tragedy.                                             CUT TO:8    INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS	Riker is working at his desk when door CHIMES.					RIKER			Come.	The DOOR OPENS and Troi ENTERS.					TROI			How are you doing?					RIKER			I'm all right.	The words are not convincing.					TROI			The crew is pretty shaken up...			I'm arranging a memorial			service... I think you should be			the one to deliver the eulogy.	There's a long beat before Riker answers.					RIKER			You'd be better at something like			that. Or Beverly. She knew him			the longest...	Troi knows he's avoiding.      STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE      11.8    CONTINUED:					TROI			I know it won't be easy... but			it's important for all of us to			face what's happened. You're in			command now. The crew will be			looking to you for guidance --					RIKER			You don't understand. I can't			give the eulogy because I won't be			at the service.	Troi is surprised at the extent of his denial.	Carefully --					TROI			A memorial service helps to give			everyone a sense of completion.			Helps them begin the healing			process...					RIKER			That's exactly the point. I don't			want to heal.					TROI			Wil --	He touches his chest.					RIKER			I've got an open wound in here, it			hurts like hell, and I don't want			it to get better. I don't want to			believe that everything's all			right.					TROI			You're angry...					RIKER			You're damn right. And I intend			to stay angry -- until I find			whoever's responsible for the			Captain's death.	Troi's patience evaporates. She's hurting, too, and	her professional demeanor crumbles under the strain.      STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE      12.8    CONTINUED: (2)					TROI			That's pretty selfish, Wil.				(a beat as Riker is				 taken aback)			Do you think you're the only one			in pain? That you have a monopoly			on loss? Well, I've got news for			you. We're all hurting... we're			all angry. And like it or not,			you've got a responsibility to the			crew. You can't just indulge your			personal desire for revenge.					RIKER				(harshly)			That's enough, Counselor.	They stare at each other, she still bristling, he	jolted by her anger and vehemence. He regrets his	attack.					RIKER				(continuing, softer)			I'm sorry.				(beat)			Deanna. This isn't about revenge.			It's about justice. The Captain			died in a bar fight... for			nothing. Somebody has to answer			for that.				(beat)			Then I can mourn.9    INT. BRIDGE	Riker is in the Captain's chair; Worf is at tactical.	Various N.D.s in the b.g.

READY ROOM (OPTICAL)	As Riker ENTERS, he stops; he stares at Picard's empty	desk for a brief moment, feeling everything it	represents... and then, decisively, he moves and sits	down -- there will be time to remember later.	He activates the desk terminal, and the image of	ADMIRAL CHEKOTE appears on the monitor.					RIKER			Sir.					CHEKOTE			I've read your report, Commander.			My condolences to you and your			crew.

YRANAC'S QUARTERS	Riker ENTERS to find Yranac sitting at a table	surrounded by a huge assortment of food, eating	heartily. Riker is carrying a PADD.					YRANAC			Ah, Commander Riker. I've been			meaning to speak to you. I was			wondering if you could move me to			better quarters. I don't care			much for the decor here.					RIKER			These are the best quarters we			have.	Yranac shrugs and continues eating.					RIKER				(continuing)			Now that you've had some time to			relax, I was hoping you might have			remembered some details about the			aliens you saw... something you'd			forgotten earlier.					YRANAC			Sorry. My memory isn't what it			used to be.      STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE      15.11   CONTINUED:	Riker suspects that Yranac knows more than he's	telling, but Yranac's being cagey -- he's protecting	every scrap of information he's got so he has something	to bargain with. Riker's task is to get him to admit	to as much as he can.					RIKER			You said the aliens looked			dangerous. How could you tell?					YRANAC			They killed someone. I'd say that			qualifies them as dangerous.					RIKER			But you said that you noticed they			looked dangerous before the fight			even started. What made you think			that? Were they unusually			aggressive... ?

Riker's combadge is	gone and there is now a small patch-like device (like	all the other mercenaries wear) at the side of his	throat.	The mercenary bridge is sleek and spare with no wasted	space, just like everything on this ship. A large	Viewscreen dominates the forward section and there's a	small Transporter pad in one corner. The walls are	lined with consoles which are manned by various N.D.	MERCENARIES.
