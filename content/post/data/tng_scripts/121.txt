SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	It's moving through sparkling, black velvet space -- a	blue-green planet slowly enlarging in the distant	background.					PICARD (V. O.)			Captain's log, stardate 41798.2.			We are ordered by Starfleet, to			proceed to the Lorenze Cluster			and investigate the disappearance			of the light cruiser USS Drake,			which was in that system trying			to unravel a mystery of its own.2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	EVERYONE's at station except Riker and Troi. Riker's	at the Aft Station going over some computer readouts.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			Recent long range probes indicate			that all intelligent life on the			planet Minos has disappeared.					PICARD			Number One?					RIKER			No help from their communications			log. The Drake reported			arriving at Minos and was never			heard from again.					PICARD			Mister Data?					DATA			The citizens of Minos gained fame			during the Ersalrope wars as			arms merchants. They manufactured			sophisticated and highly advanced			weaponry.       STAR TREK: "The Arsenal... " - 1/25/88 - TEASER       2.2    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			For which side?					DATA			Both.					GEORDI			We are nearing the planet Minos.					PICARD			Standard orbit, Mister La Forge.					GEORDI			Aye, sir. Standard orbit.					RIKER			Whatever happened to the Drake,			happened quickly, otherwise			Captain Rice would have sent			another message.					PICARD			You know Captain Rice?					RIKER			We were at the Academy together.					PICARD			Tell me about him.	Troi listens intently.					RIKER			Able. A good officer.					TROI			How would he react under stress?	Riker thinks for a beat, then:					RIKER			Paul Rice is confident almost to			the point of arrogance, but			carries it well because he usually			makes the right choices. He's			a risk taker.					PICARD			Oh.       STAR TREK: "The Arsenal... " - 1/25/88 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			I'll give you an example. One			of the final tests in advance			navigation at the Academy presents			the student with three options.			When Rice took the test, he			rejected all of them and offered			one of his own.					PICARD			I'd call that arrogant.					RIKER			But it paid off -- he received the			top mark. And now that test has			four options. The original			three... plus his.					TROI			In a difficult situation a man			like that would react aggressively.					RIKER			Agreed.					PICARD			Number One, weren't you offered			the Drake?					RIKER			Yes.					TASHA			You turned down your own command			to take this assignment?					RIKER			At the time, I thought it was			more advantageous for me to do			a tour on the Enterprise.					DATA			Captain -- readings correspond			with the findings of the probe. 			No signs of intelligent life-forms.			Vegetation and animal life only.					PICARD			None?					DATA			Correct.       STAR TREK: "The Arsenal... " - 1/25/88 - TEASER       4.2    CONTINUED: (3)					TROI			What happened to all those people?					WORF			War?					DATA			Disease?					GEORDI			A dissatisfied customer?					TASHA			In any war, natural disaster, or			even the most virulent plague,			there are always survivors.					DATA			Captain, we are being hailed.2A   EVERYONE REACTS	The question on their faces.					RIKER			How is that possible from a planet			with no people?					PICARD			Your sensors indicated no			intelligent life?					DATA			Correct.					PICARD			Put it on the Main Viewer.3    ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	A humanoid, THE PEDDLER, APPEARS on the Main Viewer.	He has a ROLLING, LILTING VOICE, the confidence of a	master salesman with a touch of the carny thrown in.       STAR TREK: "The Arsenal... " - 1/25/88 - TEASER       5.3    CONTINUED:					THE PEDDLER'S COM VOICE			Whoever you are -- wherever you're			from -- greetings and welcome to			Minos -- the Arsenal of Freedom...					PICARD			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of			the USS Enterprise. To whom am			I speaking?	The Peddler ignores the question and continues with his	pitch.					THE PEDDLER'S COM VOICE			... Where we live by the motto --			peace through superior firepower.			Come -- allow us to meet your			needs. If you need a little			something special, be it for one			target -- or multiple targets -- we			got it, you'll see it... here on			the Arsenal of Freedom. Because			we don't just provide weapons --			we also offer complete weapon			systems.					DATA			It is a recorded message.					THE PEDDLER'S COM VOICE			To be totally armed is to be			totally secure...					PICARD			It must be left over from the time			of the Romulan wars, when the			business of selling arms was			booming.					THE PEDDLER'S COM VOICE			... Remember, the early bird that			hesitates gets wormed. Perfection			in highly-advanced weaponry.			Versatility... flexibility.			And... everything one hundred			percent guaranteed... So lock on			to my signal and beam on down.					PICARD			Screen off.	The screen GOES OFF.       STAR TREK: "The Arsenal... " - 1/25/88 - TEASER       6.3    CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			It's a heck of a sales pitch.					PICARD			If an automated message system			is still functioning -- other			systems on the planet may also			be operational.					TASHA			Weapons systems?					PICARD			Possibly.					RIKER			We are going to have to go down			there to find it.					PICARD			Prepare your away team, Number			One.					RIKER			Lieutenant Yar -- Commander Data.	Data rises from his chair and is immediately replaced	by LIEUTENANT (J. G.) ORFIL SOLIS.					TASHA			Commander, I recommend a minimum			complement.					RIKER			Oh? I would have thought			otherwise.					TASHA			We'll keep the first landing party			small and mobile. Until I'm			confident that whatever killed			the inhabitants of this planet			isn't still down there.	Riker nods his agreement. And they head for the	turbolift.4thru	OMITTED5									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                STAR TREK: "The Arsenal...

PLANET SURFACE (OPTICAL)	It's a small clearing in a verdant, overgrown area.	Riker, Data and Tasha BEAM IN, and stand apprehensively	looking around. The SOUNDS OF LIFE -- BIRDS, INSECTS --	surround them. The away team stands quietly, looking	around tensely, and then slowly turning on their	tricorders and scanning the periphery, protecting each	other with their backs together.					RIKER			Spooky.				(touches com)			Riker.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Bridge.

MAIN BRIDGE	Picard in his Command position listening to the away	team.      STAR TREK: "The Arsenal... " - 1/25/88 - ACT ONE      8.7    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Yes, I heard, Number One. We'll			try to track it down from here.	Worf and the others strain over their instruments.8    EXT. PLANET SURFACE	The team moves slowly down the clearing, very alert,	and OUT OF SHOT.9    EXT. PLANET SURFACE - RUINS	Crumbled high-tech ruins, aged and rusted in spots.	The team ENTERS SHOT, Tasha leading. Near the base	of a ruin she pulls away some foliage and a melted rod	and plank of tritanium ARE SEEN.					TASHA			Tritanium. It's been melted.					RIKER			What could do that?					TASHA			Whatever it was, it's beyond our			technology.					DATA			Over here.	Data has found something. Its shape is clearly that	of a weapon: a super-high-tech RIFLE, gimbal-mounted,	with laser rheostats and sighting. Riker kneels,	scans, and examines it.					RIKER			We've never even seen anything			like this.					TASHA			It's undamaged.					RIKER			Maybe a demonstration model for			some potential buyer.					TASHA			Maybe. Let's spread out a			little.      STAR TREK: "The Arsenal... " - 1/25/88 - ACT ONE      9.10   INTERCUT	The away team as it SPREADS OUT.11   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard listening to the SOUNDS OF THEM MOVING THROUGH	THE UNDERBRUSH.					SOLIS			Commander Riker. This is			Lieutenant Solis. I am			monitoring a slight energy			buildup near your position.			I am not able to pinpoint the			source.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Give me a direction.					SOLIS			East of your position -- ten			meters. I will continue			monitoring.12   EXT. PLANET SURFACE	ON Riker -- as he looks through the foliage.					RIKER			I can't see anything from here.			The underbrush is very thick.	He goes behind the ruin to examine the back side of	it. Suddenly he tenses, sensing something.					RICE (O.S.)			Hello... Commander Riker.	Riker turns at the sound of the voice. CAPTAIN PAUL	RICE STEPS INTO SHOT. He is dressed in a Starfleet	Captain's uniform, trim and neat, a man of Riker's age	with a military bearing. He is businesslike and calm,	and acts as if this kind of meeting, under these	circumstances, is perfectly normal. Riker, on the	other hand, is stunned.      STAR TREK: "The Arsenal... " - 1/25/88 - ACT ONE      10.12   CONTINUED:					RIKER			Rice! Where did you come from?					RICE			I was over there.					RIKER			You had us worried. But, I should			have known you'd pop up.					RICE			How are you, Commander Riker?					RIKER			Me -- never mind me. How are you?			No word, no message... nothing.					RICE			How many are with you?					RIKER			Two others. Where's the			Drake? Where's your crew?13   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (INTERCUT WITH PLANET AS NEEDED)	Picard is as surprised as Riker.					PICARD			What's going on Number One?	Riker STEPS AWAY, so the following conversation is	confidential.					RIKER			It's Paul Rice from the Drake.					PICARD				(confused by the apparent				 contradiction)			Lieutenant Solis?					SOLIS			Sensors indicate low level energy			readings, but the only life signs			are the away team.					PICARD			Careful, Number One.      STAR TREK: "The Arsenal...

PLANET SURFACE	Riker MOVES BACK TO Rice.					RIKER				(to Rice)			You look strange, Paul...					RICE			I was injured getting here.					RIKER			Do you need medical help?	Riker is very suspicious and ready for anything. He	knows this image in front of him is NOT Captain Paul	Rice, but in order to find out the purpose of this	replica he will play along.					RICE			No. What is your purpose here?	Tasha and Data join Riker. They stare at Rice, who	hardly notices them.					RIKER			This is Commander Data and			Lieutenant Yar.	Data looks down at his tricorder, then back to the	figure.					DATA			Other than ourselves, sir, I am			picking up no other life signs			here.					RIKER			Yes. I know.					RICE			Riker, you didn't answer me. Who			sent you here to look for me?					RIKER			Your mother.      STAR TREK: "The Arsenal...

The name of my ship is the			Lollipop.					RICE			I have no knowledge of that ship.					RIKER			It's just been commissioned. It's			a good ship.					RICE			Riker, refresh me, would you?			What's its size and complement?					RIKER			Who's here with you?					RICE				(puzzled)			What's the armament on the			Lollipop?					RIKER			Paul -- I will only answer your			questions if you answer mine.			Why do you want to know so much			about my ship?					RICE			We're friends, aren't we?					RIKER			Old friends.					RICE			Our top speed is warp three.			What's yours?      STAR TREK: "The Arsenal...

Our			survival depends on knowing.			What's the armament on your ship?					RIKER			Ten.					RICE			Ten? I don't understand. Ten			what?					RIKER			Six.					RICE			Commander Riker, those answers			make no sense.					RIKER			You haven't used my first name			once, Paul.	There is a slight hesitation.					RIKER				(continuing)			You remember it, don't you?      STAR TREK: "The Arsenal...

Aren't you?... Answer me!	Rice twitches -- a slight REACTION, then SUDDENLY:14   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)	The Image of Captain Rice DISAPPEARS and is REPLACED	BY A WEAPON-LIKE OBJECT. IT QUICKLY MOVES several	meters away.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Report, Number One.					RIKER			The image of Rice has been			replaced by something which			is hovering several meters away.15   INT.
