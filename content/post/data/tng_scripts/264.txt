OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Picard, Riker and GEORDI are seated at the table as	Pressman moves around the room.					PRESSMAN			As some of you may know, the			starship Pegasus was lost in this			sector twelve years ago along with			most of its crew. I was the			captain and Commander Riker here			was my helmsman.					PICARD			I remember reading about it. The			ship was destroyed by a... warp			core breach as I recall.					RIKER			That's right. The Captain and I,			along with seven others managed to			get to an escape pod before the			breach became critical.					PRESSMAN			From space, we saw what appeared			to be a matter/anti-matter			explosion which vaporized the			ship.					RIKER			No wreckage was ever found, so			Starfleet officially listed the			ship as destroyed.					PRESSMAN			However, all that changed three			days ago. Starfleet Intelligence			has an operative in the Romulan			High Command. He sent us a			message that a Romulan warbird had			located a piece of debris in the			Devolin system which was			positively identified as being			from the Pegasus.

There're a lot of			things on board the Romulans would			love to get their hands on.	Riker glances uncomfortably at Pressman, but the	Admiral doesn't react to him.					PICARD			What are our orders?					PRESSMAN			We have to find the ship before			the Romulans do... salvage it if			possible... destroy it if			necessary. You'll command the			Enterprise while I remain in			overall command of the mission.					GEORDI			We'll need metallurgical and			chromographic specs on the Pegasus			in order to set up the proper			search parameters.					PRESSMAN			I'll make the appropriate			information available to you.					PICARD			Very well.				(to Riker)			Set course for the Devolin system.					RIKER			Aye, sir.	They all stand and head for the doors.                                             CUT TO:      STAR TREK: "The Pegasus" REV. 10/20/93 - ACT ONE      9.7    EXT.
