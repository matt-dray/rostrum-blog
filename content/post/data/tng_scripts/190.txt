At the			same time --2    INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM	as the door opens and GEORDI ENTERS; PICARD is at his	desk.					PICARD (V.O.)			-- we will be hosting a special			guest.					GEORDI			You wanted to see me, Captain?					PICARD			Yes, Mister La Forge. It seems			that the exemplary nature of your			work has caught the attention of			Starfleet Command.	Geordi isn't quite sure what this means, but it sounds	good.					GEORDI			Well... that's very flattering.			Thank you, sir.					PICARD			In fact, someone is coming on			board just to see some of the			engine modifications you have			made.    STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/10/90 - TEASER    2.2    CONTINUED:	Better yet... Geordi's feeling very pleased.					GEORDI			Who's that, Captain?					PICARD			The Senior Design Engineer of the			Theoretical Propulsion Group --			Doctor Leah Brahms.	Leah Brahms... Geordi can't believe it. His smile	grows even wider.					GEORDI			Leah's coming here? That's			terrific!	Picard is a little surprised at the familiarity.					PICARD			You know Doctor Brahms?					GEORDI			Well, of course I do! I --	Suddenly he stops, realizes what he's about to say,	swiftly regroups.					GEORDI			I mean, I've studied her -- her			schematics for years. She was			responsible for a lot of the			engine design on the Enterprise.					PICARD			Well, it should be an enjoyable			visit, then. She'll be			transporting on board as soon as			we arrive at the Starbase. Would			you like to greet her on our			behalf?	Would he... !					GEORDI				(restrained)			Why... yes, Captain. I'd be happy			to serve that function.	Then, smiling like a kid anticipating Christmas, he	EXITS. Picard is mildly amused by his exuberance, but	attributes it to scholarly enthusiasm.    STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/10/90 - TEASER    3.3    INT. ENTERPRISE - TEN-FORWARD	Geordi sits at the bar, drinking juice and trying to	stay calm. But he's clearly a little hyper... keeps	brushing invisible lint from his uniform. GUINAN is	behind the bar, eyeing all this.					GUINAN			You're gonna wear that uniform			out if you keep swatting at it...					GEORDI			I guess I'm a little nervous...			it's not every day a man comes			face to face with a dream...	She looks at him quizzically.					GEORDI			Remember... about a year ago...			when we were caught in that			booby-trap the Menthars set?					GUINAN			Yes...					GEORDI			While we were trying to get out			of it, I went to the holodeck to			study an engine prototype that			was built when the Enterprise was			first designed...					GUINAN			Uh-huh...					GEORDI			And the computer... well, it gave			me an image of the engine... but			it also created a hologram of the			designer. Doctor Leah Brahms.					GUINAN			So... you met a computer-simulated			female...					GEORDI			But what a computer-simulated			female... She was brilliant, of			course... but warm, friendly...					(MORE)    STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/12/90 - TEASER    4.3    CONTINUED:					GEORDI (Cont'd)			We worked like one person... what			I didn't think of, she did... I'd			start sentences, she'd finish			them. It was just so --			comfortable...	He looks up at her in the midst of the paean and sees	her skeptical look.					GEORDI			Okay, I know it was just a			holographic image... but the			computer was able to incorporate			personality traits from her			Starfleet record.					GUINAN			We all fall in love with our			fantasies, from time to time,			La Forge...	But Geordi's in no mood for cold water. He smiles,	slips off the bar stool.					GEORDI			You've got it wrong, Guinan. I'm			not necessarily expecting anything			romantic. I just know that,			whatever else, Leah Brahms and			I will be good friends.	And he saunters out, leaving Guinan gazing after him.4    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - LATER	Geordi waits with TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN.					TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN			Doctor Brahms is ready to			transport, sir.	Geordi can't wait.					GEORDI			Okay. Bring her over.    STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/10/90 - TEASER    5.4A   ANGLE - TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)	as the shimmering effect occurs and LEAH BRAHMS	MATERIALIZES. She looks a little different than she	did in "Booby Trap"... her hair is styled differently,	fuller... she's a few years older but the maturity	looks good on her. She has the same kind face and	intelligent eyes... but there's something off about	her... a set to the mouth, a sharpness. The softness	and vulnerability aren't as evident. She gazes around	the room, getting her bearings. Geordi approaches her,	smiling broadly.					GEORDI			Hi!	She looks at him, puzzled by the familiarity. Geordi	catches himself, starts over.					GEORDI			I mean... welcome aboard, Doctor			Brahms. I'm Lieutenant Commander			Geordi La Forge. Chief Engineer.	Her eyes narrow... her gaze burrows into him like a	laser.					LEAH			La Forge. So you're the one who's			fouled up my engine design.	And with that, she strides off the pad and past Geordi,	who stares after her in astonishment.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE    6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:5    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	at warp speed.6    INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING - LATER	Leah is stalking the engine room like a panther,	checking everything, registering her finds on a Padd.	Geordi follows her, well able to stay up with her	barrage of questions, but feeling inescapably on the	defensive. ENSIGN PAVLIK can be seen working in the	b.g.					LEAH			... the matter/anti-matter ratio			has been changed... the mixture			isn't as rich as regulations			dictate.					GEORDI			Experience has shown me that too			high a ratio diminishes			efficiency. I worked with the			mixture until I got the right			balance.	She makes no response, continues. If she were the old	hologram, you might guess her personality wasn't	installed yet.					LEAH			The magnetic plasma transfer to			the warp field generators doesn't			correspond to the recommended			specs.					GEORDI			Right. Again, I adjusted the			flow... sometimes in space things			work a little differently than			they do on the drawing board.	She shoots him a glance at this, registering a dig.					LEAH			Is that a criticism, Commander?    STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE    7.6    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			No, of course not. It's just...			a well-known fact. There's			theory... and there's			application. They don't always			jibe.	Her cool gaze assesses him. It feels like being probed	by an ice cube.					LEAH			You've charted a completely new			swap-out schedule for main			component replacement...					GEORDI			You bet. I found the Starfleet			estimates of MTBF units were			unrealistic. I determined my own			schedule based on observation and			experience.	Geordi faces her squarely. He doesn't like the feeling	of being called on the carpet... he's a professional	and a good one; he shouldn't have to make excuses to	anyone. A faint smile -- sardonic, not warm -- plays	on Leah's lips.					LEAH			Is that going to be your only			defense, Commander? That same			tired rhetoric...				(mimicking)			"Out here in the field we learn			things you designers couldn't			possibly understand... "					GEORDI			In the first place, Doctor, I'm			not aware of needing any			defense... in the second place			--					COM VOICE			Doctor Brahms... you have an			incoming message on subspace...	She turns to him.					LEAH			I'd like to hear this message			privately.    STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE    8.6    CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI				(gesturing)			In my office. Be my guest.	She hurries off camera, leaving Geordi alone.	Mystified. He turns glumly to the engine room... his	pride and joy... that he'd hoped to share with its	creator.									CUT TO:7    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	RIKER, DATA, and WORF at their stations. ENSIGN RAGER	at Con.					DATA			Commander, I am picking up some			unusual readings from the Alpha			Omicron system.	Riker moves over to Ops.					DATA				(continuing)			At this range, all I can discern			is that it is an asymmetrical			field of intense energy.					RIKER			What type of radiation			signature?					DATA			Unknown, sir.				(beat)			Commander, the Alpha Omicron			system has not yet been charted.			I recommend that we take this			opportunity for further research.	Riker thinks for a beat.					RIKER			We're way ahead of schedule...				(to Rager)			Alter course for Alpha Omicron.8    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship drops out of warp in a star system.    STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE    9.9    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard is now standing near Ops with Riker.					DATA			The anomaly is orbiting the			seventh planet. It is a mass of			plasma energy contained within			discrete boundaries by an outer			covering of silicates, actinides,			and carbonaceaous chondrites.					PICARD			On screen.10   VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) - INTERCUT AS NEEDED	The viewer shows a large gas giant planet with a barely	perceptible smudge of energy near the horizon.					PICARD			Magnify.	Data works his console and the object on the viewer	gets bigger. We can now see the object is pulsing and	moving fluidly... it looks like a water balloon filled	with glowing liquid that changes color frequently.					PICARD			Is it a ship?					WORF				(reading console)			It does not conform to any known			design.					RIKER			Any records of similar phenomena			in Starfleet listings?					DATA				(processes for a moment)			None, sir. This has never been			seen before.	Picard smiles... he and Riker exchange a look of	pleasure. This is why they're on the Enterprise.	Picard goes to his station, and there is a palpable	sense of excitement and anticipation in his attitude	toward this discovery.   STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE   10.10   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Ensign Rager, ahead one quarter			impulse. Bring us into orbit			around the seventh planet.			Maintain a relative distance of			ten kilometers from the object.					RIKER				(to Worf)			Alert all science labs to standby.			They should be coordinating their			efforts with Commander Data.					WORF			Aye, sir.									CUT TO:11   INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING - CONTINUOUS	Leah returns, icy as ever. But Geordi has had a few	minutes to assess the situation, and has decided to	take another tack. He smiles at her... warm...	poised... confident.					GEORDI			Doctor Brahms... there's no reason			for us to argue... we're both on			the same side, here...					LEAH			I'm aware of that...					GEORDI			So, why don't I take you on a			little tour... show you the			adjustments I've made... why I			think they work... and... we can			start pulling together on this.	She inclines her head, makes a little gesture for him	to proceed. Geordi's feeling much better... now	they're off on the right foot.					GEORDI			Okay... for instance, here in the			dilithium chamber...	She peers in, reacts sharply, accusing.   STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/12/90 - ACT ONE   11.11   CONTINUED:					LEAH			What happened here? Who did this?					GEORDI			You remember, the crystal's been			reoriented to adjust the direction			of the lattice structure.	She turns, looks at him.					LEAH			Remember? Why would I remember?	Oops.					GEORDI			Right, why would you? The ship			was having some difficulties, so			we made the modification. Hoping			it would work. And... it did.					LEAH			So it was your idea?					GEORDI			Well, not exclusively...					LEAH			It's curious... this modification			was actually due to be			introduced...					GEORDI				(nodding, finishing her				 sentence)			... in the next class starship.					LEAH				(surprised)			Yes... how did you know?					GEORDI				(faltering)			I didn't... It was the next			logical step.				(off her look)			Doctor, sometimes we have to			fly by the seat of our pants			out here... and it stands to			reason that now and then we're			gonna come up with the same			solutions you do...   STAR TREK: "Galaxy's Child" - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE   12.11   CONTINUED: (2)	She's dubious, but it makes sense... He draws a	breath, tries to keep it warm and light.					GEORDI			Listen. I've got a personnel			review scheduled to start in about			five minutes, and it's been a long			day for you. How about we...			we get together later. Sort of...			plan our agenda for the next day			or two.					LEAH			Agenda?					GEORDI			What it is we want to			accomplish... the best way to			go about it... and -- get to know			each other. It might make things			easier.	She gives him a searching look, and for a moment she	loosens a little, as though realizing she's been pretty	testy.					LEAH			Maybe you're right...					GEORDI			Okay -- nineteen hundred hours...			my quarters. Maybe we'll even			have a bite to eat... I make great			fungilli.	She smiles in surprise.					LEAH			I love fungilli.					GEORDI			Is that right... ?	Geordi smiles at her as Leah EXITS, a look of mild	puzzlement and curiousity on her face.12   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE & ENERGY BEING (OPTICAL))	The ship and energy being are in orbit around the	planet.
