CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	PICARD at his desk, star charts on a nearby monitor.	He's in some physical discomfort, presses his knuckles	to his temple, GROANS. We HEAR a CHIME from his door.					PICARD			Come!	The door opens; BEVERLY ENTERS. She carries a medical	kit.					BEVERLY			You called for me?					PICARD			Yes, Doctor. I've been feeling...			odd, lately. Fatigued. And now			I've got a headache.         STAR TREK: "The Battle" - 9/14/87 - TEASER         2.3    CONTINUED:	Unslinging her medical kit, Beverly looks up, surprised.					BEVERLY			A what?					PICARD			Certainly you know what a			"headache" is, Doctor.	Beverly is already beginning to move a medical tricorder	sensor over Picard's head. WE HEAR it FAINTLY BEEPING	as she checks readings she is getting.					BEVERLY			Of course. But I don't often			encounter one.	She makes an adjustment on the tricorder, gets HUM SOUND	as she takes another kind of reading.					PICARD			The reason for it seems fairly			obvious. What are these Ferengi			up to? "Stand by, Enterprise."			Stand by for what?					BEVERLY			I can't find a thing wrong.					PICARD			I can't either. But they could			be baiting some kind of trap...					BEVERLY			With your head. I see nothing			physically wrong, but I want to			run additional scans in Sickbay.					PICARD			Doctor, all I've got is...					BEVERLY				(interrupting)			... is an order to report to			Sickbay.				(friendly smile)			From the one person aboard who can			give you an order.	Picard hesitates, then smiles and nods, starts to rise.         STAR TREK: "The Battle" - 9/14/87 - TEASER         3.3    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Captain from first officer.			They're finally sending a message.	Picard comes fully to his feet, touching his insignia.					PICARD			On my way, Number One.				(CROSSING to door)			Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls.4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	RIKER, TROI, DATA, GEORDI, TASHA, and WORF are at their	usual stations. Picard ENTERS JOINING Riker at the	Command Area. The Main Viewer displays the Ferengi	vessel.					RIKER			They're prepared to talk, sir.					PICARD			Have they given any hint what			they've been waiting for?					TASHA			Negative on that, Captain. But			they have identified their Captain			as "Bok," DaiMon Bok.					TROI			If it's Bok I'm sensing, he seems			anxious to meet you, sir.					PICARD			Me? Why me? I've never heard			of him.					GEORDI			You'll be able to see him now,			sir. They're willing to			communicate on visual.					DATA			A reminder of something we learned			the only other time we dealt with			Ferengi, sir -- their hearing is			very sensitive.         STAR TREK: "The Battle" - 9/14/87 - TEASER         4.4    CONTINUED:					WORF				(nods)			Yes, they could pick up even a			whisper being transmitted.					PICARD			Consider ourselves reminded.				(to Tasha)			Open hailing frequencies.					TASHA			Hailing frequencies open, sir.					PICARD			Ferengi vessel! This is Captain			Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.			We are transmitting visually.	A beat, then the Main Viewer DISSOLVES INTO a FULL FRAME	HEAD SHOT of DAIMON BOK, brightly lit, distorted. He's	smoothly patronizing, clipped in speech, and arrogant.	(OPTICAL)					BOK			Is this THE Captain Picard?					PICARD			Do we know each other?					BOK			I know you, Picard.					PICARD			I'm afraid you have the advantage.			Is this... Bok?					BOK			I am Bok, DaiMon of the Ferengi.			I have asked you here to discuss			a mutual problem, Captain.					PICARD			What problem is that, DaiMon Bok?					BOK			I insist on speaking of that			matter in person. Shall we meet			on your vessel or mine?	Troi signals Tasha who touches her panel.         STAR TREK: "The Battle" - 9/14/87 - TEASER         5.4    CONTINUED: (2)					TASHA			Hailing frequencies closed.					TROI			Captain, I sense considerable			deception on Bok's part. And			danger!					RIKER			Then definitely, sir, you should			meet with him here. Keep him			under our control.	Picard nods, turns and signals to Tasha who touches her	panel again.					TASHA			Now open, sir.					PICARD				(toward Viewscreen)			I appreciate your offer, DaiMon			Bok, and ask you to be our guests.					BOK				(smiles)			As you wish, Picard. Perhaps this			will begin a new era of			cooperation for both our peoples.			In one Earth hour, then?	Everyone on the bridge is stunned by the unexpected	concession.					PICARD			One hour, Bok. End transmission.	The viewer CLEARS BACK to the Ferengi ship. The	Enterprise bridge crew reacts.					WORF			I can't believe they're coming			here!					PICARD				(turns to Troi)			They agreed a bit too easily.	Troi nods.         STAR TREK: "The Battle" - 9/14/87 - TEASER         6.4    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD				(continuing; nods back)			Then, in one hour we'll know why.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   STAR TREK: "The Battle" - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE         7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:5    INT. SICKBAY	Beverly is using twenty-fourth century diagnostic tools to	examine the prone Captain.					PICARD			Are you accustomed to always			getting your way, Doctor?					BEVERLY				(nods)			When my way makes sense, Captain.			There are still forty minutes			before the Ferengi beam over; I'll			have these scans done in ten.					PICARD			A lot of effort for something as			simple as a headache.					BEVERLY			"As simple?" It is my job to know			your condition intimately. You			should not have a headache unless			something is wrong.	She is clearly puzzled over finding nothing. She makes	a new setting on the scanner.					BEVERLY				(continuing)			It may be true that headaches were			once quite common... but this was			in the days before the brain was			charted...				(very puzzled; a new				 setting)			... before we understood the nature			of pain... when we were suffering			from such things as the common			cold.	She swings the "scanner" away from Picard. He half	rises.					PICARD			And so why do I have a headache,			Doctor?         STAR TREK: "The Battle" - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE         8.5    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			I haven't the slightest damned			idea!	She picks up a tiny device, turns it on and WE HEAR a	light HUM from it.					PICARD			What's that?	She presses it against his forehead. The light HUM	becomes SHRILLER.					BEVERLY			Something doctors use when they			feel foolish over being proven			wrong.				(takes device away)			Feel better?					PICARD				(surprised)			The pain's gone.	She turns the device OFF, puts it aside.					BEVERLY			Medical fakery -- the pain's			actually still there, just			cloaked. I'll want further exams			when this Ferengi matter is			settled.6    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Riker, Troi, Data, Geordi, Tasha and Worf on duty as	WESLEY ARRIVES by turbolift, hurriedly addresses Riker:					WESLEY			Sir! You'll soon be getting an			intruder alert!					RIKER			What? Wesley, if you've something			to report...	But Wesley has hurried toward Geordi, interrupting:         STAR TREK: "The Battle" - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE         9.6    CONTINUED:					WESLEY				(to Geordi)			If you'll scan heading four-four			mark one-six-three, Lieutenant,			you'll find...	INTRUDER ALERT SIGNAL sounds, Tasha reacting, turning	to Riker:					TASHA			Intruder alert, sir...					GEORDI				(reading his panel)			I've got something, sir... very			distant.	Turbolift opens TO BRING Picard onto the bridge,	unnoticed by most as Tasha silences the ALERT and Wesley	turns to Riker.					WESLEY			It's an old style starship,			Constitution Class, heading this			way under impulse power, sir.					RIKER			Says who?	Picard moves in to Command Area. Conversation DIES as	he takes his seat there.					PICARD			Carry on.				(to Wesley)			Answer the first officer's			question.					WESLEY			Uh... says the long distance			sensors, sir. I was in			Engineering, playing around with			boosting sensor output...					DATA				(interrupting; smiling)			Very interesting. Boosting it			how?				(seeing Picard's look;				 to Wesley)			We will discuss it later.        STAR TREK: "The Battle" - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE        10.6    CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI				(interrupting)			I read it now, sir, as... a			Constitution Class starship...			coming this way under impulse			power.	Exactly as Wesley described it minutes before. Picard	suddenly grimaces, a wave of pain catching him by	surprise and he has to suppress a surprised GROAN and	finds it necessary to again press a knuckle against his	forehead for a moment.					RIKER			Sir? What's wrong?					PICARD				(fighting it off)			Nothing, just... a mild headache.				(to Wesley)			The correct procedure, Ensign,			would have been to signal your			finding to the bridge immediately.					WESLEY			Yes, sir.					RIKER			Bringing it here personally...				(indicates Main Viewer)			... perhaps with the idea of being			on hand for the Ferengi beam			over... might have imperiled our			ship had something hostile been			approaching.	Wesley has thrown Picard a nervous look at Riker's guess	that the Ferengi beam over was his motive.					WESLEY			Yes, sir.					WORF			We are receiving no signal at all			from the approaching starship,			sir.					DATA				(to Picard)			Time, sir.        STAR TREK: "The Battle" - 9/14/87 - ACT ONE        11.6    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			Time?

It solidifies into BOK, KAZAGO, and RATA.					PICARD			We welcome you in peace to the			Enterprise, DaiMon Bok.					BOK				(ingratiating)			It is our pleasure, Captain			Picard. Might I introduce my			first officer, Kazago, and my			second, Rata?					PICARD				(nods to acknowledge)			This is my first officer,			Commander Riker...				(Bok nods)			And Counselor Troi.

Riker fills in:					RIKER			You wouldn't want him, Kazago.			He's second-hand merchandise.					DATA				(rises)			Second-hand, sir?				(then sees Riker's				 smile)			Oh, of course! A human joke...					TASHA			Excuse, Captain, but the			unidentified starship is			continuing in, still no signal			at all...					BOK			Think nothing of it..

That fine vessel			was Ferengi!					DATA				(to Picard)			Which you destroyed, sir.					PICARD				(turns to Bok)			My sincere regrets, Bok, but that			ship did not identify itself.			It simply attacked; we defended			ourselves...					BOK				(beat)			Such mistakes happen in space.					DATA				(to Picard)			Hardly a "mistake," sir.
