SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it orbits the planet.					BEVERLY'S V.O.			Acting Captain's Log,			Supplemental: The skeleton crew			left on board the Enterprise is			unable to help in the search for			Commander Data. The planet's			unusual EM field is interfering			with the ship's sensors, severely			limiting their effectiveness.2    INT. BRIDGE	Since we have only the skeleton crew the Bridge is	slightly undermanned. BEVERLY stands at an Aft Station	studying the sensors. There is a young woman, TAITT,	at Tactical.					BEVERLY			Without our sensors, we're sitting			ducks. A Borg ship could be right			on top of us before we knew it...				(turns to Tactical)			Ensign, we need to modify the			sensor array to filter out these			EM pulses. Can you do that?	Taitt turns to her. She is young -- not long out of	the Academy, from the looks of it -- eager to please,	and a little nervous. There is a hesitation before she	answers.					TAITT			Yes, sir.				(beat)			I think so.	Taitt begins to work the controls and Beverly can't	help but smile to herself. Gently --      STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - 6/24/93 - TEASER      2.2    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			What's your name?					TAITT			Taitt, sir.					BEVERLY			I don't think I've seen you			before.					TAITT			I was just posted here six weeks			ago.					BEVERLY			Well, Taitt -- I'll bet you never			thought you'd be serving as			Tactical Officer after only six			weeks.	Taitt looks up at her, grateful for the understanding	of her predicament she hears in Beverly's voice.					TAITT			No, sir, I sure didn't.				(beat)			I think I've filtered out some of			the sensor noise. I'll bring the			modifications on line.					BEVERLY				(approvingly)			Good work.	Beverly starts crossing down toward the Command Area	when Riker's voice comes in over the Com:					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Riker to Enterprise.					BEVERLY			Go ahead, Wil.                                             INTERCUT BRIDGE WITH:3    EXT.

Taitt starts working her console.					BEVERLY			Crusher to Picard.	Still no answer.					TAITT				(off console)			I'm not getting a Com signal from			anyone on the Captain's team.					BEVERLY			The last time they checked-in they			were investigating a structure in			section gamma two-five.	Suddenly, Taitt reacts to something on her readout.	She looks a little pale.					TAITT			Sir, I'm picking up a vessel			closing in on our location.					BEVERLY			Is it a Borg ship?	Taitt fumbles at the controls. This is all unfamiliar	to her.					TAITT			It... it seems to match the			configuration of a ship The			Enterprise encountered... at			Ohniaka Three...					BEVERLY			Red Alert. How long before			they're in weapons range?      STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - 6/24/93 - TEASER      4.3    CONTINUED: (2)					TAITT			Ahh... about... ninety seconds.			No -- no, make that seventy			seconds.	Taitt is nervous and having to work hard to hold	herself together. She does not inspire confidence.					BEVERLY				(to com)			Crusher to Transporter Room Three.					SALAZAR'S VOICE			Salazar here, sir.					BEVERLY			Start transporting the Away Teams			off the surface.					SALAZAR'S VOICE			Aye, sir.					BEVERLY			Use the transporters in the cargo			bays if you have to. I want those			teams up here as fast as possible.4    ON THE SURFACE	In the b.g. we see two N.D. 's of his team, and another	team more at a distance.					RIKER				(to an N.D.)			Armstrong, you and the others get			ready to beam up.				(to com)			Beverly, Worf and I will stay here			and look for the Captain's team.					BEVERLY			I'm not going to leave you down			there --					RIKER				(firm)			Pull as many people off the			surface as you can and get back to			the transwarp conduit. The			Captain's orders were to get the			Enterprise to Federation space.      STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - 6/24/93 - TEASER      5.4    CONTINUED:	Beverly has no choice but to back off.					BEVERLY			Acknowledged.					RIKER			Riker, out.                                             END INTERCUT ON BRIDGE.	Beverly accepts what she has to do, but she doesn't	like it one bit.					BEVERLY				(to con officer)			Prepare to leave orbit.					TAITT			Sir, the Borg ship is powering up			its forward weapons array.			They'll be in firing range in...			in twenty seconds.					BEVERLY				(to com)			Salazar, how many people are still			down there?5    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (INTERCUT)	SALAZAR, a young NCO, is at the controls. We can see	several Away Teams stepping off the Transporter pad.					SALAZAR			Seventy-three, sir.	On the Bridge, Beverly moves toward the Viewscreen.					BEVERLY			Put the Borg ship on screen.6    ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	The Borg ship is bearing down in the distance.					TAITT			Should I raise shields, sir?					BEVERLY			Not yet. I want to keep bringing			people up until the last possible			second.      STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - 6/24/93 - TEASER      6.6    CONTINUED:	Everyone reacts to Beverly's order; she's cutting it	close, but if she pulls it off she'll have gotten that	many more people off the surface.					TAITT			Ten seconds.					BEVERLY			Stand by to raise shields and			break orbit on my mark.					TAITT			Five seconds.					BEVERLY			Mark.7    ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)	The Borg ship fires at the Enterprise. The Enterprise	is rocked by the blast.					TAITT			Shields are down to seventy			percent.					BEVERLY			Establish a frequency-shift firing			pattern and return fire.					TAITT			Ah... right.	On the Viewscreen, we see the Borg ship taking a direct	hit as the Enterprise passes above it and continues	away.					TAITT			Direct hit... no damage.					BEVERLY			Helm, set course for the conduit,			maximum warp.8    OMITTED    STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - REV. 6/24/93 - TEASER    7.9    EXT.

BRIDGE					TAITT			The Borg aren't following us, sir.					BEVERLY				(to com)			Salazar, how many people did we			leave behind?11   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM	Where we see more Away Teams stepping off the Pad and	filing out the door.					SALAZAR			Forty-seven, sir.12   INT. BRIDGE	Beverly is not happy about this. Her frustration	shows.					BEVERLY				(to herself)			Another minute and we could have			had them...13   EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE	Riker and Worf are now alone, the two N.D.s having been	evacuated. The planet's surface suddenly seems that	much more vast and desolate.					RIKER				(hits combadge)			Riker to any team leader.					POWELL'S VOICE			Lieutenant Powell here, sir.					RIKER			Round up everyone who was left			behind. Take cover and try to			avoid any contact with the Borg.      STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - 6/24/93 - TEASER      8.13   CONTINUED:					POWELL'S VOICE			Aye, sir.					RIKER			Riker, out.	Riker turns to Worf.					RIKER			Even if Beverly gets back to			Federation space, it'll be a few			days before Starfleet can get any			ships here... until then, we're			on our own.	They both know they're facing pretty stiff odds.

BORG HALL (OPTICAL)	LORE is moving through the crowd of Borg that still	surround PICARD, TROI, and GEORDI. DATA is nearby, as	is CROSIS.					LORE			What do you think of my followers,			Picard? Impressive, aren't they?					PICARD			I'm not particularly impressed.			You've simply taught them to enjoy			killing.					DATA			You are wrong, Captain. My			brother and I serve a much higher			purpose.	Troi stares at Data, noticing something unusual.					TROI			Data... I can sense feelings in			you.					DATA			Yes. My brother has made it			possible.					PICARD				(realizing)			He gave you the chip -- the one			Doctor Soong made for you.	But this produces only a merry laugh from Lore. During	the next, Picard's attention is focused on Data --	studying, inspecting, looking for any clue to his	unusual behavior.					LORE			Oh, no, no. I still have the			emotional program my father			designed. I wouldn't want to give			it up. It's what has given me			such a strong sense of family --			an intense desire to re-unite with			my dear brother.   STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT ONE   10.14   CONTINUED:					TROI			Then you're responsible for			bringing him here.					LORE			He came of his own accord. All I			had to do was lure the Enterprise			into investigating those attacks			we staged. Once the Borg told him			about my plans, I knew Data would			want to join me.					GEORDI				(surprised)			You mean... you attacked those			outposts... killed all those			people... just to get Data here			with you?					PICARD			How did he do it, Data? What made			you decide to come here?	Lore has noticed Picard ignoring him, focusing on Data.	Nettled, he grabs Picard's arm and turns him away from	Data, toward him.					LORE			I am talking to you, Picard. I			will tell you what you need to			know.					PICARD			You're controlling him. And			you've corrupted the Borg.	Lore stares at Picard, anger draining, shaking his head	sadly.					LORE			You simply don't understand.   STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT ONE   11.14   CONTINUED: (3)					LORE			You have no idea what has happened			here. How I found my true			calling... how the Borg found			something to believe in.					PICARD			I'd like to learn about it. But			I want Data to tell us.	This produces another flare in Lore.					LORE			I told you -- I will tell you what			you need to know.					PICARD			How do you like that, Data? He			won't even let you talk.					DATA			Do not try to drive a wedge			between us, Captain. I am loyal			to my brother.	Lore beams at this. But even during the next, Picard	continues to focus on Data, watching him and ignoring	Lore.					LORE			You see, Picard? He's not your			pawn anymore. I've helped him			break free --				(gesture to Borg)			-- just as I've helped them.	Lore begins moving through the Borg, wound up now and	enjoying being center stage. He is putting on a show,	not just for Picard and crew, but for his faithful	followers.     STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - 6/24/93 - ACT ONE     12.14   CONTINUED: (4)					LORE			Look at them. Look at what I've			helped them become. They're no			longer mindless automatons.			They're passionate. Alive.					TROI			Are you saying you caused them to			become individuals?					LORE			No. You and your friends did			that. All I did was clean up the			mess you made when that Borg you			befriended returned to his ship.					DATA			Hugh interfaced with the others			and transferred his sense of			individuality to them. It almost			destroyed them.					PICARD			Data, do you remember when Hugh			was on the Enterprise? Do you			remember what you were like then?	Lore moves to step directly in front of Picard, forcing	his attention.					LORE			That doesn't matter.					PICARD			It does to me. I want to know			what's happened to Data.	Lore seethes at this, has to struggle to control his	temper.   STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT ONE   13.14   CONTINUED: (5)					LORE			What's important is what I've done			here. I've found my calling,			Picard. I know now why I was			created. And no one can ever take			that away from me.	He gestures to the Borg.					LORE			Without me, they would have			perished. When I stumbled on			their ship, they were lost,			disoriented -- they had no idea			how to function as individuals.			They couldn't even navigate their			vessel. They had lost their sense			of purpose.	He turns back to Picard, drilling into him.					LORE			I gave them that purpose. And			they gave me mine.					DATA			The Borg aspire to the perfection			my Brother and I represent: fully			artificial life forms. We are			their future.					LORE			The reign of biological life forms			is coming to an end. You and			those like you are obsolete,			Picard.	Lore turns to Data.					LORE			Take them, Brother.     STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - 6/24/93 - ACT ONE     14.14   CONTINUED: (6)	Data gestures to a BORG GUARD for assistance, then	pulls out a Borg-style WEAPON and moves forward to take	Picard and the others away. Off Lore's approving	look...15   EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - DAY	Riker and Worf come to a stop on a ridge that is	covered by scrub-like vegetation. Worf scans with his	TRICORDER.					WORF				(off tricorder)			Still no sign of the structure.					RIKER			With all this interference it			could be a hundred meters away and			we wouldn't know it.				(frustrated)			This could take hours.	Worf sees something off to one side, and takes a few	steps in that direction.					WORF			I am detecting a faint energy			reading.	Riker moves to him, scanning.					RIKER			Residual thermal traces... someone			stopped here...					WORF				(also scanning)			The decay rate indicates they were			human...					RIKER			They followed this path...	They move off, scanning the ground before them.   STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT ONE   15.16   INT. BORG CELL (OPTICAL)	Data and the Borg Guard are marching the prisoners into	a brig-like holding cell. Picard and the others have	obviously been working on Data, trying to assess what's	happened to him, trying to find a way to reach him.					PICARD			You must realize that something			has happened to you. The Data I			know would not be a willing party			to Lore's plan.					DATA			I now realize that my life aboard			the Enterprise was a waste. My			quest to become human was			misguided, an evolutionary step in			the wrong direction.	Troi tries another tack.					TROI			Data, all I'm sensing from you is			anger... hatred -- have you felt			any other emotions?					DATA			There are no other emotions.					TROI			What about love... joy?					DATA			Those are words without substance.			Love is nothing more than the			absence of hate. Joy is the			absence of fear.     STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - 6/24/93 - ACT ONE     16.16   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Just because you haven't			experienced certain emotions			doesn't mean they don't exist..			Lore is just feeding you the			negative ones.					DATA			Counselor Troi herself told me			that feelings are not positive or			negative, it is how we act on them			that becomes good or bad.					PICARD			Fine. Then what about the things			Lore is proposing? What about the			lives that have already been lost?					DATA			You do not understand. In a quest			such as ours, sacrifices must be			made. It is regrettable. But the			greater good must be served.	Data turns to Geordi.					DATA			Give me your Visor.					GEORDI				(disbelieving)			Why?	Data raises his Borg WEAPON threateningly.					DATA			Give it to me or I will take it by			force.	Geordi has no choice but to surrender it. He takes the	VISOR and EXITS the cell. The Borg Guard activates the	force-field, which FRITZES on and is visible for only	a moment.

UNDERGROUND CAVERNS	Riker, Worf, and Hugh have moved to another part of the	chamber and are talking. Hugh has explained Lore's	takeover of the Borg, and his take on it does not sit	right with Worf.					WORF			You blame us -- for what has			happened to the Borg?	Hugh is on the attack, his words tinged with anger.					HUGH			You gave me a sense of			individuality -- changed me and			sent me back to the collective.			You must have known that change			would be passed on to others.					RIKER			We considered it. We knew it was			a possibility...					HUGH			Then you made it possible for Lore			to dominate us.					WORF			I do not accept that. Lore is			only one man. The Borg could have			stopped him.					HUGH			You don't know the condition we			were in when he found us.	Remembering, Hugh's anger diminishes somewhat; but his	words still have a bitter edge.					HUGH				(continuing)			Before my experience on the			Enterprise, the Borg were a singleminded			collective. The voices in			our heads were smooth and flowing.			But after I returned, the voices			began to change. They became			uneven... discordant.  STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - REV. 6/25/93 - ACT THREE  29.29   CONTINUED:	Riker and Worf listen, rapt.					HUGH			For the first time, individual			Borg had differing ideas about how			to proceed.				(beat)			We couldn't function.

Lore promised clarity			and purpose.	Hugh begins to move deeper into the cavern; Riker and	Worf follow.					HUGH				(continuing)			In the beginning, he seemed like			a savior. The promise of becoming			a superior race -- of becoming			fully artificial -- was			compelling. We gladly did			everything he asked of us.	Riker and Worf listen as they walk the cavern.					HUGH			But after a while, it became clear			that Lore had no idea how to keep			his promise.

They are horribly	twisted and misshapen, as if by nerve damage.

The	crippled Borg manages a smile at this small kindness.					HUGH				(continuing)			This is the result of my encounter			with the Enterprise, Commander.			So you can see I don't			particularly welcome your presence			here.	Riker looks around the cavern, at the ragged little	band. There seems to be little our people can say to	change Hugh's feelings. After a moment --					RIKER			I'm sorry you feel that way.	Riker glances at Worf, gestures that they should get	going.					RIKER			We came here to get our people.			I don't want to cause you any more			trouble...	Hugh is about to let them leave, but he can't dismiss	his experience on the Enterprise that easily.					HUGH			Tell me... about my friend.					RIKER			Friend?					HUGH			The human called Geordi.  STAR TREK: "Descent, Part II" - REV. 6/30/93 - ACT THREE  31.29   CONTINUED: (4)					RIKER			I wish I could tell you.
