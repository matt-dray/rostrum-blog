SICKBAY (OPTICAL)	The room is in a state of frenetic activity. N.D.	NURSES and DOCTORS are rushing about, grabbing	equipment and moving consoles in preparation for some	imminent emergency. BEVERLY grabs her medical	tricorder as she directs people to action.					BEVERLY				(to Nurse)			Get the stasis units in here and			bring them on-line.				(to another Nurse)			Tell Doctor Selar to use ward			three for the ambulatory cases,			I'll take the --					COM VOICE			Transporter Room Four to Sickbay.			They're coming in now.					BEVERLY			Acknowledged.				(to everyone)			Back everyone.	They all clear out the center of the room as RIKER,	PICARD, WORF, and THREE N.D. CREWMEMBERS MATERIALIZE.	Worf is carrying Picard over one shoulder. Riker has	a nasty-looking head wound and is pointing his phaser	as if defending them. One N.D. is also injured and	lying on the floor, while the other two are standing up	with phasers drawn.	Once the beam-in has finished, Beverly and the Nurses	rush to aid the wounded. Beverly moves to Picard as	Worf puts him down on the operating table. We can now	see that there is a large SCORCH mark on Picard's	chest. Beverly immediately begins scanning him with	her tricorder.					BEVERLY			What happened?					RIKER			The Lenarians attacked us outside			the conference room.          STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 11/30/92 - TEASER          2.1    CONTINUED:					BEVERLY				(off tricorder)			He's in cardiac arrest.				(to Nurse)			Get the pulmonary support unit.	The CLAMSHELL is moved into place over Picard's chest.	Worf and Riker move away to give them room and they	look on with concern. Beverly continues to read the	tricorder.					BEVERLY			Internal hemorrhaging... the bioregulator			in his artificial			heart's been fused... damage to			the spleen and liver... what kind			of weapon did this?					WORF			A compressed teryon beam.					BEVERLY				(to Nurse)			Forty cc's inoprovaline...	An ALARM SOUNDS from the clamshell.					BEVERLY			Activity in the isocortex is			falling. Cortical stimulator.	A Nurse hands her a device, which Beverly places on his	forehead. A monitor in the room begins to show a	flatline and ALARMS are continuous now.					BEVERLY			Now.	Picard's body JERKS... then nothing.					BEVERLY			Again.	His body JERKS again... nothing.          STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 11/30/92 - TEASER          3.2    NEW ANGLE	We are now looking DOWN at the scene in Sickbay from	directly overhead... as we begin to PUSH DOWN onto	Picard's face, Beverly and the others can be seen	working frantically on him, but there is NO SOUND	except for a slowly building RUSHING NOISE, similar to	the sound of the ocean. As Picard's face fills the	frame, the rushing sound builds to a ROAR and suddenly	the scene...                                             FADES TO WHITE.	FADE IN:3    LIMBO	SILENCE. Picard is standing in blindingly WHITE LIMBO	without walls or ceiling. He is dazed and confused...	unsure where he is or what's happening to him. He	struggles to look around, but he cannot discern	anything in this uniformly bright place. Suddenly an	even more INTENSE LIGHT fills part of the scene.	Picard holds up a hand to shield his eyes from this	painfully intense light, but he does not retreat. He	struggles to look into the light.3A   POV PICARD (OPTICAL)	The glowing luminescence has a form... it is the shape	of a FIGURE standing in the light.3B   PICARD	determined to find out who this is, moves toward the	silhouetted figure. He finally stops in front of it.	He can barely look into the light at all.          STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 11/30/92 - TEASER          4.4    THE FIGURE (OPTICAL)	reaches out for him with one hand.5    PICARD	reaches out toward the hand... they clasp hands and	suddenly...6    NEW ANGLE	revealing Q standing with Picard, holding his hand. Q	is wearing white flowing ethereal robes.					Q			Welcome to the afterlife, Jean-Luc.				(beat)			You're dead.	OFF Picard's shocked reaction...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 11/30/92 - ACT ONE         5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:           (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)            7    LIMBO - CONTINUOUS	Picard angrily drops Q's hand.					PICARD			What's going on, Q?					Q			I told you. You're dead. This is			the afterlife. And I'm God.					PICARD			You are not God.					Q			Blasphemy! You're lucky I don't			cast you out, or smite you or			something.	Picard is unamused.					PICARD			I don't know what game it is			you're playing, but I am not going			to participate.					Q			What an ego.				(sarcastic)			Did you think the great Jean-Luc			Picard would never die?					PICARD			Q, whatever you've done to --					Q			I haven't done anything.				(beat)			Check your heart rate. Go ahead.	Picard hesitates... then puts a hand to his throat...	he reacts with shock as he finds nothing.					Q			No pulse? What a surprise.       STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - REV. 12/07/92 - ACT ONE       6.7    CONTINUED:	Try as he might to deny it, Picard is coming to the	realization that Q is on the level. But he still	fights against a facile acceptance of Q's word.					PICARD			How do I know this isn't another			one of your tricks?					Q			Think, Jean-Luc. Why would I go			to all the trouble of faking your			death when I could simply kill you			whenever I felt like it?					PICARD			Is that what happened?					Q			I wouldn't want to steal the			credit... it was a rather			disgruntled Lenarian actually.	This strikes a chord with Picard. He begins to	remember what happened...					PICARD			The conference...					Q				(impatient)			Yes, yes. The conference, the			unexpected attack, the compressed			teryon beam... the bottom line is,			your life ended about five minutes			ago under the inept ministrations			of Doctor Beverly Crusher.	Picard takes a moment to think about this. He pushes	away the idea that Q might be telling the truth.         STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 11/30/92 - ACT ONE         7.7    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			No. I am not dead. I refuse to			believe there is an afterlife			which is run by you.				(beat)			The universe is not that badly			designed.	Q gives a bored and frustrated sigh.					Q			Very well. If you really require			more evidence of your post-mortem			status, I'll just have to provide			some...	Suddenly, Picard hears a deep VOICE coming from behind	him.					MAURICE'S VOICE			Jean-Luc...	Picard freezes in place at the all-too familiar voice.8    NEW ANGLE	Picard slowly turns around and sees his father, MAURICE	PICARD standing behind him. Maurice is in his	eighties, but seems healthy and vital.					PICARD				(shocked)			Father...	Maurice is clearly disapproving.       STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - REV. 12/08/92 - ACT ONE       8.8    CONTINUED:					MAURICE			I told you not to go running off			to that Academy. I told you that			Starfleet would bring you to a bad			end. But you wouldn't listen.			Now look at you... dead before			your time.	Picard's words are meant for Q, but he can't take his	eyes off of his father's face.					PICARD			All right, Q... enough.					Q				(innocent)			Enough what?					MAURICE			Why couldn't you listen? Didn't			you understand that I was only			looking out for your best			interests?	Picard turns to Q in rage.					PICARD				(hard)			Q, stop this.					MAURICE			Even now, after all these years...			you still manage to disappoint me,			Jean-Luc.9    ON PICARD	The words knife through Picard. He turns back	around... but Maurice is GONE. Picard stares out into	the white emptiness for a moment.        STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - REV. 12/08/92 - ACT ONE 9-9A.          9    CONTINUED:					PICARD			I hope you're enjoying this, Q.					Q			This isn't for me. This is for			you, Jean-Luc... I wanted to give			you an opportunity to make peace			with your sordid past.	Picard turns back to Q after a beat, determined not to	let Q call the tune.					PICARD			I find it hard to believe that			you're doing this for the benefit			of my soul.					Q			Now that you've finally shuffled			off the mortal coil, we're free to			spend some time together. I			simply want you to be at peace			with yourself.					PICARD			"Some time together?"... how much			time?					Q			Eternity.	Beat.					PICARD			So I'm in hell.					Q			That's the spirit, Jean-Luc.			Don't let a little thing like			death slow down that rapier wit.      STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - REV. 12/08/92 - ACT ONE      9B.9    CONTINUED: (2)					Q				(beat)			Now you're sure you don't have any			regrets or feelings of guilt about			your former life? I can't have			you whining and complaining			through eternity.					PICARD			If I'm truly dead, then my only			regret is dying... and finding you			here.					Q				(mock)			You wound me, Mon Capitain. After			all, I wasn't the cause of your			death...      STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - REV. 12/08/92 - ACT ONE      10.9    CONTINUED: (3)	He holds up a hand and a DEVICE APPEARS in it. It's	about the size of a softball and part of it is burnt	and fused.					Q				(re: device)			... this was.	Picard recognizes the form, but it's still a shock.					PICARD			Is that...					Q			Your artificial heart.	He tosses the device to Picard, who catches it. Picard	looks down at it with a sort of horrific wonder. There	is something very strange about holding one's own	heart. He examines it closely.					Q			You might have lived if you'd had			a real heart instead of this			unreliable piece of technology.				(beat)			How did you manage to lose yours			anyway?	Picard pauses... looks at the device for a long moment.					PICARD				(quiet)			It was a... mistake.	Q immediately senses that he's onto something here. He	presses Picard further.					Q			Something you regret?					PICARD				(finally admitting)			I regret a great many things from			those days...					Q			Really?	Q looks off to one side.9A   OMITTED         STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 11/30/92 - ACT ONE         11.10   NEW ANGLE	In the direction Q is looking, there are now three	people standing in the dark: NAUSICAAN #1, #2, #3, and	a YOUNG PICARD. The Nausicaans are large, burly aliens	with hideous features. The Young Picard is about	twenty-one years old and is wearing an old-style	Starfleet uniform.	The following happens very quickly:	Young Picard has Nausicaan #1 on the ground and is	holding him in some type of wrestling lock. Nausicaan	#2 pulls a nasty-looking weapon with a long serrated	blade from his belt as Nausicaan #3 grabs Young	Picard's arms. Nausicaan #2 then DRIVES his weapon	THROUGH Young Picard's back. The Young Picard LAUGHS	just before he falls to the ground.11   ON PICARD AND Q	Who have just seen the above action play out.					Q			It wasn't very smart of you to			take on three Nausicaans like			that.	Picard walks over and stands above the still form of	his younger self which is lying on the ground. (The	Nausicaans are gone.)					PICARD			No, it wasn't.					Q			And did I hear you laugh? It's so			unlike you to have a sense of			humor... especially about getting			stabbed through the back.	Picard still can't take his eyes off the image of his	younger self.					PICARD			I was... a different person in			those days... an arrogant,			undisciplined, young man with far			too much ego and far too little			wisdom.				(beat)			I was more like you.         STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 11/30/92 - ACT ONE         12.11   CONTINUED:					Q			I'm sure you were far more			interesting in those days. A pity			you had to change.					PICARD			The only pity is that I had to be			impaled through the back before I			learned my lesson.				(beat)			I started that fight with the			Nausicaans... I started it			because I was young and cocky...	He looks down at the artificial heart he is still	holding.					PICARD			If I had been more responsible at			that age... I wouldn't have needed			this heart... and I wouldn't have			died from a random energy surge			thirty years later.					Q			So if you had it to do all over			again... ?12   ON PICARD	He looks thoughtful as he recalls the events of his	youth.					PICARD				(quiet)			Things would be different...	We MOVE IN CLOSE on Picard's face and suddenly a	WOMAN'S HAND SLAPS him across the face.                                             CUT TO:13   INT.

Picard turns to see...15   COREY AND MARTA (OPTICAL)	who are standing in the room. COREY ZWELLER is a tall,	lanky, twenty-one year old, with long hair that	probably barely passes regulations. MARTA BATANIDES is	a short, pretty woman, and is also roughly twenty-one.	They are both wearing old-style Starfleet Ensign	uniforms and the jackets are unbuttoned, suggesting a	casual gathering.	Picard immediately recognizes them both, but he's still	trying to adjust to where he is. Corey and Marta are	both laughing and applauding Picard -- neither knows	that the man standing before them is not twenty-one.					MARTA				(applauding)			Bravo! Bravo!					COREY				(applauding)			Nicely done.					PICARD			Cortan? Cortan Zweller?					COREY				(surprised)			Of course it's me... boy, she			must've hit you pretty hard.	Marta moves to him and jokingly pats his cheek where	the woman slapped him.					MARTA			You're slowing down, Johnny.

Now he's just playing			for sympathy.	Corey begins to button up his jacket.					COREY			I want to get something to eat and			head over to the casino at			Bonestell. Who's coming?					PICARD			I'll... catch up with you later.	Marta is still concerned about Picard.					MARTA			Are you sure you're all right?					PICARD			No, no. I'm fine Marta -- Marty,			really.	Marta still isn't quite convinced, but Corey only rolls	his eyes.					COREY			Come on, Marty. I bet he has			another date anyway.	Marta gives Picard a wry look.					MARTA			That's it, isn't it?				(pokes him in chest)			You are incorrigible.	Marta begins buttoning her jacket too as she and Corey	head for the door.         STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 11/30/92 - ACT TWO         15.15   CONTINUED: (2)					COREY				(to Picard)			Try not to end up in the hospital.	They EXIT. Picard looks after them for a beat, trying	to ground himself in what's going on. He looks down at	his own uniform and notes the insignia. Q suddenly	APPEARS, wearing a normal Captain's uniform and holding	a swagger stick.					Q				(barks)			Attention on deck, Ensign Picard!	Picard almost stands at attention out of reflex before	catching himself.					PICARD				(irritated)			Q...					Q			That's Captain Q to you, young			man.					PICARD			What's the point of creating			this... fantasy?					Q			It's no fantasy. This is all very			real, I assure you. You're twenty-one			years old again... a brash			young man, fresh out of the			Academy.	Picard looks down at his hands and then looks at	himself in a mirror.					PICARD			I don't look it.					Q			To everyone else, you do.	Picard tries to punch holes in Q's story.					PICARD			I thought you said I was dead...			now you tell me I'm alive?					Q			You mortals can be so obtuse.

Dom-Jot is a cross between billiards and craps.	People place bets on various multi-colored images on	the table as players take turns hit balls with cue	sticks. There are many bumpers and pockets and lights	come on according to the state of play.	Picard ENTERS and sees that the CROWD gathered around	the Dom-Jot table is cheering on Corey, who is wielding	his cue stick with professional confidence. Corey's	opponent is an ALIEN who holds his cue stick in misery.	Picard moves to stand next to Marta.					MARTA				(re: Corey)			He's winning.					PICARD			Of course.					MARTA			I thought you had a date.					PICARD				(beat)			She... decided to leave.					MARTA				(ironic)			You're getting old, Johnny.	Corey hits a final ball and a LIGHT goes on.

The following happens very	quickly:	Picard sees Nausicaan #2 begin to draw his weapon as	Corey cocks back his arm to throw a punch. Picard	throws an elbow into Corey's chest, knocking him	backward and preventing him from starting a fight.	Corey is caught completely by surprise and he tumbles	hard over the table and chair. There is a beat of	shocked silence from everyone.	Suddenly the Nausicaans begin to laugh at the spectacle	of the quarreling officers. The tension is broken as	they go off to another area of the gambling center.             STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 11/30/92 - ACT FOUR            42.29   CONTINUED: (2)					NAUSICAAN #1				(to others)			Orcho lok resnik Starfleet...	As they move away, Picard turns around to see Marta	helping Corey up.

Nausicaan #2 then DRIVES his weapon	THROUGH Picard's back.             STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 12/01/92 - ACT FIVE            51.38   ON PICARD'S FACE	As the serrated metal blade comes out of his chest.	Picard drops to his knees and lets out a LAUGH of pure	joy before falling to the ground...                                             MATCH CUT TO:39   INT. SICKBAY - ON PICARD'S FACE	He is laughing, still on the operating table as seen in	the Teaser.40   WIDER	Revealing Beverly, Worf, and Riker looking on in	puzzlement. Only a few minutes have passed since the	events seen in the Teaser. Beverly is leaning over him	with a medical DEVICE.					BEVERLY				(off monitor)			His vital signs are stabilizing...				(beat)			Captain... ? Jean-Luc... ?	Picard's eyes open at last and he looks up at Beverly,	still smiling.					BEVERLY			You've been injured... but I think			it's going to be all right.	Picard's surprised at being here at all. With a final	chuckle, he closes his eyes. The others all exchange	glances.                                             CUT TO:41   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ship at impulse power.42   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Picard is finishing a long talk with Riker.					PICARD			... I still don't know what to make			of it all. Was it a dream? Or			one of Q's elaborate tricks?             STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 12/01/92 - ACT FIVE            52.42   CONTINUED:					RIKER			A lot of people who've been near			death have talked about strange			experiences... but they're not			usually so detailed.					PICARD			Part of me cannot accept the idea			that Q would have given me a			second chance... that he would			demonstrate that much...			compassion.				(beat)			But if it was Q... I owe him a			debt of gratitude.					RIKER			In what sense? It sounds like he			put you through hell.					PICARD			There were many things in my youth			that I'm not proud of... they were			loose threads... untidy parts of			myself that I wanted to remove.				(beat)			But when I pulled on one of those			threads... I unravelled the			tapestry of my life.	Riker smiles at some inner joke.					RIKER				(off Picard's look)			I was just trying to imagine you			as a hell-bent-for-leather young			officer insulting a Nausicaan			twice your size. I wish I'd			gotten a chance to meet that Jean-Luc			Picard.	Picard smiles and leans back in his chair. He's more	at ease discussing this part of his life than he ever	has been before... a small demon has been put to rest	and he can talk about his youth with a new joy and	pride.					PICARD			Well, to tell the truth... that			wasn't the first time I'd had a			run-in with a couple of surly			Nausicaans...             STAR TREK: "Tapestry" - 12/01/92 - ACT FIVE            53.42   CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			Really?					PICARD			Oh, yes...				(beat)			During my sophomore year I was			assigned to do some training on			Morikin Seven.
