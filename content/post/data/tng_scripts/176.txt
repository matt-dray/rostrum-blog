Picard makes his decision.					PICARD			Number One, assemble the rest of			your away team and prepare for			immediate rescue operations.					RIKER			Yes, sir.	They lock eyes for a moment. Picard doesn't need to	add, "Be careful." Riker knows all too well what he	may be heading into.3    INT. TALARIAN OBSERVATION CRAFT (OPTICAL)	Gaseous, dark, flickering neon lights accent the area	as Riker, Worf and BEVERLY MATERIALIZE with TWO MEDICAL	SUPERNUMERARIES carrying equipment. Riker, tricorder	in hand, steps forward, wary and alert. They move into	the interior of the ship, scanning constantly with his	tricorder, the others following.					WORF				(checking tricorder)			Ancilary power is failing,			Commander.	They move throught the cabin, and then spot --4    THEIR POV - AN ADJACENT AREA	revealing FIVE TALARIANS, some with radiation burns,	most too weak to stand.

SICKBAY	One critical-status Talarian is being treated for	radiation damage. Other survivors are whisked into the	ward by MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARIES.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, supplemental: We			have completed emergency			evacuation of four Talarians			-- and one human. How this young			man found himself in the custody			of these aliens remains a mystery.	Across the ward, sitting cross-legged on a diagnostic	bed, is JONO -- the human. He is ramrod straight, eyes	fixed ahead, jaw clenched. With steely determination,	he avoids any effort by Beverly to make contact with	him. Troi observes.					BEVERLY			It's Jono, right? Is that what			I heard them call you?	She speaks casually, warmly, as she scans him with her	tricorder. Jono ignores her.					BEVERLY			I'm Doctor Crusher. I'm examining			you for radiation injuries. It			won't hurt.				(beat)			I have a son not much older than			you. Maybe you'd like to meet			him.	No response.					BEVERLY				(gamely)			Well, Jono... you seem to have			escaped radiation damage. Pretty			lucky.				(reacting to something				 on the tricorder)			How did this happen -- ?    STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/25/90 - ACT ONE    7.5    CONTINUED:	Suddenly, Jono covers his face and emits a high-pitched	shriek -- a keening -- and begins rocking back and	forth. Other Talarians, like babies responding with	sympathetic crying, take up the awful screech.	Startled, Beverly moves away from the boy.	Instinctively, Troi moves forward, toward him.					BEVERLY			What is it?					TROI			He's -- terrified.6    OMITTED6A   INT. SICKBAY - CONTINUOUS	Picard and Riker ENTER; Beverly approaches them.					BEVERLY			They all just started up,			Captain.    STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE    8.6A   CONTINUED:	A roomful of shrieking teenagers does not sit well with	Picard.					PICARD			May I have your attention, please?	They continue the keening sound.					PICARD			Please -- may I have your			attention?	No response. Finally, frustrated, Picard walks toward	Jono.					PICARD			Stop that immediately!	The unmistakable voice of authority gets Jono's	attention instantly. He breaks off in mid-cry, turns	and stares at Picard in a mixture of awe and respect.	The others stop the screech as soon as Jono does.					PICARD			Well. That's better. Now, what's			your name, young man?	Jono blinks, but doesn't answer.					TROI			He won't talk, Captain. We			haven't been able to get through			to him.					JONO			Captain -- ?	Electrified by that word, Jono jumps off the bed and	crosses to Picard, bows his head.					JONO			Captain... I am Jono. Take me			home, to my Captain. Take me home			to Endar!	Picard stares awkwardly down at the young man at his	feet. Then he looks up at Troi, who has observed this	little scene. She is smiling slightly. Picard has	made an instant connection with this troubled boy.    STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/25/90 - ACT ONE    9.7    INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER	Picard ENTERS with Beverly.					BEVERLY			He managed to escape radiation			trauma... but his scans showed			something else...					PICARD			What?	Beverly rises, paces. She is disturbed by what she has	to say.					BEVERLY			Two previously fractured ribs...			a broken arm... a low-grade			concussion. There may be			neurological impairment... I'll			have to examine him further. Jean			Luc -- the Talarians have always			been ruthless to their enemies...			I think there's a real possibility			they may have brutalized the			child.	Picard is appalled, but wants, as always, to consider	all possibilities.					PICARD			Isn't it possible he was injured			prior to his captivity?					BEVERLY			Not likely. He's been with them			a long time... long enough to			assimilate their cultural			traits... and calcium trace			patterns indicate the injuries			occurred during the past seven			years.					PICARD				(frowns)			But if they have... abused the			boy... why would he devoutly wish			to return to them?					BEVERLY			That's not uncommon. It was			identified centuries ago as the			"Stockholm syndrome."    STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE    10.7    CONTINUED:	Suddenly, there is commotion from the Sickbay and as	Picard and Beverly react...8    INT. SICKBAY - JONO - THEIR POV	He is thrashing on the bed, resisting the efforts of	two medical SUPERNUMERARIES and Troi to restrain him.	Then, he bursts into that dreadful shriek. The other	Talarians follow suit.9    ON PICARD AND BEVERLY	as they rush from the office.					PICARD			Now what?	Jono has leapt from the table and is tearing around the	room, shrieking.					TROI			I suggested he take off his			gloves... Suddenly he went out			of control.	The medical personnel are still scrambling to grab	Jono.					BEVERLY				(hits insignia)			Security, we need some assistance			in Sickbay...					WORF'S COM VOICE			Acknowledged, Doctor.					PICARD			Jono -- !	Seeing Picard, Jono stops shrieking, but keeps dancing	away from his pursuers, agitated and hyperventilating.					JONO			She won't leave me alone! She			keeps trying to dissect me!					PICARD			She was trying to help you!   STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE   10A.9    CONTINUED:					JONO			I don't want her help! All I want			is to be with my brothers! Send			us back to Captain Endar!	Jono may be confused, and he may have suffered, but at	the moment he's a child throwing a tantrum. Worf	ENTERS, takes in the scene... begins to move at Jono...	Picard wants to de-escalate the incident...    STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE    11.9    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Jono -- I want you to stop this			immediately!	Jono stops short, responding almost involuntarily to	the voice of authority. He lifts his head, then bows	it again to Picard.					JONO			Yes, Captain.					PICARD			That's better. Now, if we're to			accomplish anything --					DATA'S COM VOICE				(interrupting)			Data to Picard.					PICARD			Go ahead.					DATA'S COM VOICE			We have received a subspace			communique from Starfleet Command,			regarding the young human, sir.	Jono's eyes flicker at this, but he does not move.					PICARD			Very well. Doctor, Counselor...				(join me)	Moving with Picard --					BEVERLY			Mister Worf, escort this young			man to quarters... he's to be			confined there until further			notice.    STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/24/90 - ACT ONE    12.9    CONTINUED: (3)					WORF			Yes, Doctor.	Jono has listened to this interchange with interest. A	beat as the boy and the Klingon measure one another.10   OMITTED10A  INT. N.D. QUARTERS	Worf and Jono ENTER.					JONO			Why are you here, Klingon -- with			them? Did they capture you, too?					WORF			They are not my captors. They			are my comrades.	Jono snorts derisively, then --   STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE   12A.10A  CONTINUED:					JONO			Why do you take orders from a			female?					WORF				(reacts)			Doctor Crusher? She is my			superior officer.    STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/18/90 - ACT ONE    13.10A  CONTINUED: (2)					JONO				(a snort of contempt)			Among my people, a female could			never outrank a man.					WORF			You are human, and among humans,			females can achieve anything			males can.	Jono stares at him, clear-eyed and sure.					JONO			I am not human any more than you			are. I am Talarian.	Worf regards the boy with sadness, understanding his	plight perhaps better than anyone.					WORF			You are confused...	Suddenly, the boy launches into that ear-splitting wail	again, jarring Worf from his sympathy.					WORF			Stop that!    STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/18/90 - ACT ONE    14.10A  CONTINUED: (3)					JONO			I will make the B'Nar -- the			mourning -- until I am back with			my brothers!	He starts up again and Worf backs away, covering his	ears, then EXITS, shaking his head.11thru	OMITTED1313A  INT.

CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PICARD'S QUARTERS	Picard approaches his quarters, carrying a portable	visual monitor; as he does, he hears the muffled sound	of noise from within: a maelstrom of electronic sound,	discordant and unstructured. Puzzled, he opens his	door. The sound blasts forth, deafening.20   INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS	The volume of the noise is truly frightening. Picard	looks around his room, noting that the furniture has	been completely re-arranged.					PICARD			Computer, turn off that noise!	Instantly, there is blissful silence.					PICARD			Computer, what was that?					COMPUTER'S VOICE			The "Alba Ra"... a contemporary			Talarian musical form.					PICARD			Jono?

RACQUETBALL COURT - LATER (OPTICAL)	Picard is with Jono, giving him basic instruction in	the game. It has changed over the centuries in about	the way that tennis, say, changed from Henry VIII's	day to the present. The basic principles are the same;	the racquet is different -- sleeker, more streamlined	-- and the ball is electronic: perhaps it glows from	within. Most important, when it is hit, or hits a	wall, there is an ELECTRONIC SOUND -- something that	will begin to sound not unlike a phaser.					PICARD				(demonstrating)			I serve from here... like this...				(serves)			And you must hit it back before			it bounces twice. Let's try it.	Picard lobs an easy serve into Jono's forehand; the	boy with unerring instinct hits a kill shot about a	foot off the ground. Picard turns to look at him.					PICARD			Not bad.					JONO			I win at all the games.					PICARD			I can believe it.

Jono has natural ability and	the resilience of youth, and gives Picard a run for it.	The electronic ZAP of the ball as it ricochets around	the court becomes louder and louder, and gradually its	presence changes, sounding more and more like a weapon.39   JONO (OPTICAL)	reacts to this, shaking his head as though to clear it.					PICARD			Jono? You all right?					JONO			Fine.	He serves and they ENTER into a long rally... the	SOUNDS becoming louder, now mixed with more sounds of	WARFARE -- muffled explosions, people shouting, the	rapid sound of phaser fire. Then, the sound of voices	--					CONNOR'S VOICE			Take him and get to cover!					MOIRA'S VOICE			I can't leave you!	Jono stops, face twisted in anguish. He covers his	ears, tries to blot out the sound. He will murmur,	"No, no... " softly through the rest. Picard's voice	will echo as though it's coming from far away.					PICARD			Jono -- what is it?!	Jono flails on the ground as the vortex of sound	increases.					CONNOR'S VOICE			Take Jeremiah... get to the			forest! I'll hold them off!					MOIRA'S VOICE			No, come with us!					CONNOR'S VOICE			Go!        STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/19/90 - ACT FOUR       43.39   CONTINUED:	Rapid sound of PHASERS, now, and many shouting voices,	explosions.

This way!	A sudden explosion, louder than the rest, and a woman's	dreadful scream. Jono sinks to the ground, head buried	in his hands. The child's voice begins to cry in	terror, calling out, "Mama... mama... mama... "40   PICARD AND JONO	as the sounds begin to fade. Picard kneels with him,	puts his arm around the shaking boy's shoulders. Jono	looks up at him, his face wet with tears.					JONO			She was... all red. I cried...			but she didn't answer me...	The boy breaks into sobs again and buries his head.	Picard rubs his shoulder. He's not sure just what he	should be doing, but he does know that an important	breakthrough has been made.41   INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS - LATER	Jono sits talking with Picard. They are still in	racquetball clothes. Jono is subdued, but talks	freely.					JONO			... she used to sing to me...

TEN FORWARD - MINUTES LATER	Picard ENTERS with Jono, now both showered and	dressed. Picard spots Riker at a table with Wesley	and Data, steers the boy toward them.					RIKER			Well, how was racquetball?					PICARD			He gave me quite a game for his			first time out.	The flicker of a smile -- the first we've seen -- plays	on Jono's lips. He is much more relaxed now, as though	a great burden has fallen away.					JONO			I look forward to the next time,			Captain.        STAR TREK: "Suddenly Human" - REV. 7/16/90 - ACT FOUR       45.42   CONTINUED:	Picard grins, glad that Jono's cockiness is returning.					PICARD			I'm sure you do. sit down, Jono.			What would you like?	Jono and Picard sit.

Finally Riker	can't help it and he snorts with laughter. Wesley	starts laughing. Then Jono looks back at Wesley and	then he bursts into laughter.					DATA			I fail to see why this is amusing.					RIKER				(still chuckling)			Check your data banks on humor...			subheading "Slapstick"...					DATA				(inspecting Wesley)			Comedy stressing farce and			horseplay... ah, this no doubt			is a variation on...

Jono ENTERS, approaches Picard like	a thief in the night. He gazes down at the sleeping	Captain, struggling with his emotions.48   CLOSE ON PICARD AND JONO	Picard is groggy, but recognizing Jono, gives him a	smile.
