SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND THE USS REPULSE (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise has rendezvoused with the other	Federation ship near the spectacularly beautiful binary	system -- Alvacorn Major.1A   INT. ENTERPRISE - SHUTTLE BAY (OPTICAL)	The shuttlecraft leaves the Enterprise for the USS	Repulse.2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard is not on the bridge. RIKER has the command	chair - DATA is at Science Station, WESLEY is at Conn	-WORF is at Tactical. The other positions are filled	by n.d. crewmembers. Riker watches the Main Viewer as	the shuttlecraft closes with the Repulse.					RIKER				(to Worf)			Open hailing frequencies.					WORF			Hailing frequencies opened.					RIKER			Repulse, this is the Enterprise.			We are getting underway.					REPULSE VOICE			Acknowledged, Enterprise.			Transfer complete -- good luck on			your mission.					RIKER			And to you.					REPULSE VOICE			Give my regards to your captain.			Repulse out.          STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:					WESLEY			The Shuttle Bay is secure.					RIKER			Thank you Mister Crusher. Make			all preparations to get underway.3    OMITTED4    INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM (OPTICAL)	Picard is there with GEORDI. Geordi is showing Picard	the plans for a device he is proposing to build.					GEORDI			We will construct this large			enclosure on Cargo Deck Five.	The door CHIME SOUNDS.					PICARD			Come.	Riker enters and makes his report.					RIKER			The transfer is complete. Doctor			Pulaski is being shown to her			quarters. We are ready to get			underway.					PICARD			Very good. Take a look at the			containment module our new chief			engineer has designed.	Riker steps over.					RIKER			"Chief engineer," that has a nice			ring to it.					GEORDI			It does to me.				(then to business)			Each will have total atmospheric			control... temperature, radiation,			light, humidity, plus electrical			spectrums.					RIKER			And these are put into the large			containment area?          STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - TEASER          3.4    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Yes, these modules will keep the			specimens alive -- the large			containment area will keep us			alive. Now, I have to go and			replicate this five hundred and			twelve times. This will mean			it will be necessary to divert			power from the warp engines to			the replicator.					PICARD			How long will we be on impulse			power?					GEORDI			For a few hours, but it can't be			helped.	Picard nods.					RIKER			When we leave 'aucdet Nine - I'm			going to want all the power you			can slam into those warp engines.					GEORDI			You'll have it.	Geordi exits.					PICARD			I will relieve you at zero three			zero zero.	Riker acknowledges and leaves.5    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	as Riker walks back onto the bridge.					RIKER			Take us out of orbit, Mister			Crusher -- set course for 'aucdet			Nine.					WESLEY			Aye, sir. Course for 'aucdet Nine			has been input.          STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - TEASER          4.5    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Maximum impulse velocity.					WESLEY			Aye, sir.					RIKER			Engage.6    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it makes a slow graceful turn.7    EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	The Enterprise starts as a dot in the distance -- quickly	approaches at impulse speed and makes a close passby.	After a beat, a heretofore unseen speck begins to glow,	then moves -- chasing after the starship.8    EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	as the glowing ENERGY closes on the Enterprise. It	catches the ship and approaches from the rear -- going	between the warp engines.9    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Minimal crew. Data is at the Science Station studying	the display screen.					DATA			Engineering -- this is Science One.			I just observed what appeared to			be a random energy transference.10   INT. CHIEF ENGINEER'S OFFICE	Geordi is working at the panel on the far wall.					GEORDI			Where?					DATA'S COM VOICE			Aft. Outboard of the port			nacelle.          STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - TEASER          5.10   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Hold on -- I'll check.10A  INT. MAIN ENGINEERING	Geordi moves to the center console.					GEORDI			No -- I show nothing here, Data.11   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Data is not satisfied and continues running checks.					RIKER			Problem, Commander?					DATA			Possibly. An unexplained power			fluctuation.					RIKER			Let me know if it reoccurs.12   EXT. SPACE - CLOSE ON THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	The ball of light moves closer to the Enterprise. It	slides along the skin of the ship; then, without damage	to the hull, the ball goes inside.13   INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)	The corridor is empty. If there were nighttime in	space, this would be it. The ship is quiet. The	little glow of energy emerges. It pauses as though	getting its bearings, then cautiously moves off.14   INT. CORRIDOR - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	We FOLLOW the glow as it continues along. The	turbolift doors open and TWO CREWMEMBERS exit. The	glow blends into the corridor wall and neither	crewmember sees it. The glow falls in behind them as	they pass.          STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - TEASER          6.15   INT. CORRIDOR - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	At an intersection the crewmembers turn left. The	energy again pauses, then continues straight ahead	resuming its journey - or is it a search? The energy	exits up through the overhead.15A  OMITTED16   INT. CREWMEMBERS' QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	The energy enters. It pauses over the sleeping form of	one of the male crewmembers... then moves away.17   INT. TROI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	The energy enters the room, passing effortlessly	through the closed door. It pauses -- again getting its	bearings. It has a definite sense of purpose as it	moves slowly toward the sleeping form on the far side	of the room.18   ANOTHER ANGLE - THE BED (OPTICAL)	We recognize COUNSELOR DEANNA TROI. The energy pauses	by her head, then LEAVES THE FRAME as it moves down her	body. We HOLD on Troi's face. After a beat she turns	-- the restless movements of a tortured dream... sweat	beads up on her forehead, SUDDENLY she wakes. For a	moment she does not move -- then she looks around the	room for the "person" (lover) she knows must be there.	There is no one. The room is empty. But she knows	that someone or something has been there and that she	will never be the same again.	Off her look of concern... and fear... we:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE         7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:19   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it continues along at impulse speed.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, Stardate 42073.1.			There has been an outbreak of a			yet unclassified Plasma Plague			in the densely populated Rachelis			system. We are on an emergency			run to a Federation Research			station on 'aucdet Nine, where			specimens of Plasma Plague are			kept. We will then transport that			deadly cargo to Science Station			Tango Sierra, where hopefully an			antidote can be manufactured.			Every hour we delay, thousands			die.20   OMITTED20A  INT. CARGO DECK FIVE	In the center of the huge cargo bay, a crewmember is	assembling a very large containment area which will	hold the five hundred and twelve modules.					GEORDI			How's it going?					CREWMEMBER			Finished, just waiting to insert			the modules.21   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard comes out of his Ready Room:					PICARD			Number One.					RIKER			Lieutenant La Forge says we will			be able to engage the warp drive			within the hour.         STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE         8.21   CONTINUED:	Picard nods an acknowledgement as he takes his seat.					PICARD			Mister Data, when we receive a			complete list of all the specimens			we will be carrying, I want you			and Doctor Pulaski to go through			it... by the way. Where is our			new doctor? Has she reported in?					RIKER			Not yet.	Picard is obviously irritated by the breach in	procedure.					PICARD			Sickbay, this is the captain.					SICKBAY VOICE			Sickbay, aye.					PICARD			Is Doctor Pulaski there?					SICKBAY VOICE				(slight hesitation)			Ah... no, Sir. The doctor is in			Ten-Forward.					PICARD			What?!				(surprised, then				 annoyed)			A few hours on board and she's			already found Ten-Forward.	Riker starts to rise.					RIKER			I'll go and get her.					PICARD			No, Number One. I'll go.	Picard rises and strides toward the turbolift.					WORF			Not the best way to meet your new			captain.         STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE         9.22   INT. CORRIDOR	As Picard exits the turbolift, he encounters Wesley.					WESLEY			Hello, Captain.					PICARD				(a greeting)			Ensign Crusher.	Picard continues to stride purposefully down the	corridor with Wesley a few steps behind trying to keep	up.					PICARD			I'm sorry this mission will delay			your reunion with your mother.					WESLEY			It's all right. I can use the			time to finish some projects.					PICARD				(dismissive)			We shouldn't be more than a week			or so.	Wesley wants to continue the conversation.					WESLEY			It is going to be hard to leave			the Enterprise...					PICARD			Mixed feelings for all of us.	Picard glances back and sees the look of sadness in the	young man's eyes.					PICARD				(continuing)			It's always difficult leaving any			ship, as it was for your mother			when she left to become head of			Starfleet Medical. But going			from one assignment to another			is part of the life which you are			choosing.					WESLEY			Yes, but this isn't "any" ship.         STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE         10.22   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Truly.	Wesley stops and watches Picard continue to	Ten-Forward. The sadness remains in the young man's	eyes.23   INT. TEN-FORWARD	As Picard enters he crosses with a CREWMEMBER. The	crewmember's reaction tells us very clearly that Picard	is not a frequent visitor to Ten-Forward. We FOLLOW	Picard as he walks over to the BARTENDER. This is the	first time we get to see this wonderful room.24   ANOTHER ANGLE - PICARD AT BAR	GUINAN is behind the bar.					PICARD				(greets her)			Guinan.	She nods a greeting.					GUINAN			Captain.					PICARD			Where's Doctor Pulaski?	With a hand motion, Guinan indicates a table.25   ANOTHER ANGLE	as Picard approaches one of the tables. We can see	that DOCTOR KATHERINE PULASKI is talking with someone,	but we cannot see with whom. Picard strides	purposefully up. Clearly his ire is up.					PICARD			Doctor Katherine Pulaski?	Pulaski looks up.					PULASKI			Ah... you must be Captain			Picard...         STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE         11.25   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Doctor -- protocol on your last			assignment might have been lax,			but here on the Enterprise...					PULASKI				(she abruptly cuts him				 off)			Sit down, Captain. You better			listen to this.26   ANOTHER ANGLE - TABLE	We now see that the doctor is with Troi. Picard and	Troi exchange looks. Picard senses trouble and moves	a step closer.27   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)	Riker, Data, and Worf have assembled. Picard enters	with Doctor Pulaski and Troi. As he walks briskly	toward his seat.					PICARD				(he touches his				 communicator)			Lieutenant La Forge, status			report.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			The containment area is completed,			the last of the modules are being			inserted.					PICARD			Take us to warp six as soon as			possible.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Acknowledged.	Picard takes his seat and moves on to other -- equally	urgent business.					PICARD			This is Doctor Katherine Pulaski.			We will handle the formal			introduction later.         STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE         12.27   CONTINUED:	The SUBTLE APPRAISALS, the doctor of the crew and the	crew of the new doctor, are cut short as Picard takes	his seat and announces.					PICARD				(continuing)			Counselor Deanna Troi is			pregnant.	The reactions of the crew. During what follows we	will INTERCUT the reactions of everyone. These will	change as each new piece of information is revealed.	Data, almost in awe. Life, any life, is amazing to	him. Riker glances over at Troi and thinks however	briefly of what might have been. Worf -- suspicious,	distrustful.					RIKER			A baby!	Worf is noncommittal, Data curious. Riker surprised,	and the question is clearly on his mind (whose baby?).					RIKER				(continuing)			This is a surprise.					TROI			More so for me.	Before Riker can react to that statement, Pulaski takes	control of the meeting.					PULASKI			This pregnancy is unlike anything			I have ever encountered. Since			she came to me a few hours ago,			I have made two complete			examinations of Counselor Troi.	She activates the wall viewer on which appears the	sonic representation of a healthy, humanoid fetus.					PULASKI				(continuing)			This is from the first			examination. The fetus is about			halfway through the first			trimester -- about six weeks old.			Understand, we...					(MORE)         STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE         13.27   CONTINUED: (2)					PULASKI (Cont'd)				(indicating herself and				 Troi)			... believe conception occurred			about eleven hours ago.					RIKER			What?					PULASKI			It gets better.	The screen changes.					PULASKI				(continuing)			The second exam, an hour later			was consistent, except for the			fact that the fetus "appeared"			to be several weeks older.	She steps away from the screen.					PULASKI				(continuing)			At this growth rate, Counselor			Troi will have her baby within			the next thirty-six hours. The			normal gestation for a Betazoid			is ten months.	For a beat, the group is in stunned silence.					RIKER			I do not mean to be indelicate,			but...				(pause)			... who's the father?					TROI			Last night, while I slept...			something... which I can only			describe it as a presence, entered			my body.	Troi turns and looks at the image of the fetus.         STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE         14.27   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			A life-form of unknown origin			and intent is breeding right now			inside Counselor Troi. Our			purpose here is to determine what			is to be done about this very			"unusual" situation. Discussion.					RIKER			Let me get this straight -- Deanna			was impregnated by... by what?				(to Pulaski)			Doctor, what do your tests show?			Is it a humanoid? An alien?	She stands, goes to the display screen and activates	it.					PULASKI			It's a male human... or in this			case half-human -- half-Betazoid.					RIKER			Exactly the same as Deanna!					PULASKI			In every way. There is no			indication from any of my tests			of any other genetic patterns			except hers.28   TROI	We HOLD on Troi as she continues to watch the child	moving inside her. The discussion fades from her	consciousness.					RIKER			I don't think this is a random			occurrence. There is a purpose			here -- a reason. What, I don't			know.					WORF			Captain, obviously the pregnancy			must be terminated.					RIKER			Why?         STAR TREK: "The Child" - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE         15.28   CONTINUED:					WORF			For the safety of the ship and			crew.	Troi stares at the moving fetus on the viewscreen.	Seeing it, alive, helpless, touches other emotions.	However it was conceived, it is hers.
