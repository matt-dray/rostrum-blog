Stardate 44805.7.			For generations, the people of			Kaelon Two have been working to			revitalize their dying sun.

OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)	Picard, RIKER, Timicin, DATA, TROI, BEVERLY and Geordi,	who holds a PADD. Timicin is still remote, cool and	official though not unfriendly...					TIMICIN				(mid-conversation)			The basic theories for helium			fusion enhancement have been			discussed for over a century...			but there's been no method of			practical application until now...					DATA			The modifications that you have			made on the torpedo's guidance			systems are remarkable, doctor...	Timicin doesn't smile... he's a man who doesn't easily	accept a compliment... especially from a stranger...					TIMICIN			We'll see. They still have to			be proven in a practical test.	As he gestures toward it, we see for the first time, an	image of a red giant star displayed on the MONITOR.					TIMICIN				(continuing)			At least, now it is possible.			I never dared hope to find such			a perfect match with our own sun.      STAR TREK: "Half A Life" - REV. 2/27/91 - ACT ONE      7.8    CONTINUED:					PICARD				(nods)			Our only regret is that it took			us three years to find a suitable			star after you first contacted			us.	Timicin clears his throat... obviously struggling to	say something personal here... it doesn't come	easily...					TIMICIN			This means a great deal to us,			to me... We are not used to			dealing with other worlds... to			asking for anything from others.			But your offer to help... it has			given us a possible means to our			survival.					GEORDI			It's your work that's made this			possible, Doctor...					BEVERLY			That's right, we're only the			delivery service here...					TIMICIN				(humble)			It has taken forty years of my			life to develop the programming			which will control your photon			torpedos... it has been my life...			my only wish has been to find a			way to revive our sun before I			die... thank you for giving me			this opportunity.      STAR TREK: "Half A Life" - REV. 2/27/91 - ACT ONE      8.9    INT.

HOMN	He is interrupted by the opening of the doors and the	swooping ENTRANCE of Lwaxana -- who'll be followed by	her valet, MR. HOMN. He is carrying a picnic basket	loaded with (covered) picnic fare. Throughout:					LWAXANA			Enough is enough; rescue is at			hand. Doctor Timicin, will you			clear all that mess from the			table, please?					GEORDI			That mess? Mrs. Troi...					LWAXANA			Now now now, you've been shut up			in here for hours; perfectly			ridiculous.				(to Timicin)			The table, please.	Timicin is a little overwhelmed by the energy of this	woman... glances at Geordi... begins to tentatively	clear the table... as she continues...					LWAXANA				(continuing)			If you boys don't eat something			you're going to be sick and who's			that going to help? I've made			some irresistible Mantickian pate.			Mister Homn will lay it out for			us.	As Mister Homn acknowledges this with a bow, Lwaxana	explains to a bemused Timicin...					LWAXANA			Mister Homn is my valet. He			doesn't say much.     STAR TREK: "Half A Life" - REV. 2/26/91 - ACT ONE     13.14   CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(mutters)			How can he?					DATA			It is true that the intellectual			efficiency of high order beings			does diminish proportionately when			the deprivation of rest or			nutritious fuel is...					GEORDI				(interrupts; gives up)			All right, all right; don't you			start.					TIMICIN			Mrs. Troi...	And his voice turns all heads to him... has he had	enough, is he fed up with her? Is this where he cuts	her off? A dramatic pause...					TIMICIN			You are a wise woman. I'm sure			we could use a respite.					LWAXANA			These two call me Mrs. Troi. You			call me Lwaxana. Mister Homn?			Spread it.	As Hohm spreads the tablecloth over the pool table,	Goerdi sighs and frowns... but for the first time since	we've met him, Timicin smiles.14A  INT. TURBOLIFT	As Lwaxana and Timicin ENTER...					LWAXANA			So, knowing that my daughter's			starship would be passing fairly			close to Betazed, I maneuvered			a ride, and here I am.				(to Com)			Deck Eight.	As the turbolift starts to move, Lwaxana reacts to...     STAR TREK: "Half A Life" - REV. 2/26/91 - ACT ONE     14.14A  CONTINUED:					TIMICIN			I also have a grown daughter.			She has a little boy of her own.					LWAXANA			Then you're married.					TIMICIN			My wife died quite some time ago.	Off her reaction...15   INT. CORRIDOR	Lwaxana and Timicin EXIT the turbolift. As the walk	down the corridor...					LWAXANA			One thing I don't understand...			if your people have known for			generations that their sun is			dying... why not simply evacuate			the planet?					TIMICIN			It is our home... it defines who			we are as a people. If Kaelon			ceases to exist... so do we...					LWAXANA			Then you definitely should fix			it.	They come to a stop outside the door to Lwaxana's	Quarters.					TIMICIN			With the Federation's help... I			hope we will.					LWAXANA			And the Federation is pleased to			offer whatever help it can. Which			means you will come in for a			nightcap?					TIMICIN			That's extremely kind of you,			but...     STAR TREK: "Half A Life" - REV. 2/26/91 - ACT ONE     15.15   CONTINUED:					LWAXANA			My valet sleeps elsewhere.	He chuckles.					TIMICIN			You are delightful. You make			me laugh. I mean, I don't mean			your invitation makes me laugh...			I mean I take it quite seriously			but...					LWAXANA			Then say yes. And I'll make you			laugh some more.					TIMICIN				(beat)			I... wish I could. But I have			to say "no".	And there is clear regret in his eyes... but this is	the right thing to do...					TIMICIN			Goodnight, Lwaxana.	She's disappointed, but undaunted. She throws him a	last coy smile as she disappears into her quarters. He	turns toward his own door -- has a second thought --	turns back and raises his hand preparatory to Ringing	the Chime -- but catches himself. His face reflects	that he is troubled beyond what he's allowed her to	see. He finally turns again and goes through into his	own quarters.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                  STAR TREK: "Half A Life" - 2/22/91 - ACT TWO        16.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:16   EXT.
