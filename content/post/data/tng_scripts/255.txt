JEFFERIES TUBE	GEORDI is rushing up a ladder in the tube. The RED	ALERT CLAXON is sounding around him -- this is clearly	an emergency. He is wearing his Starfleet uniform, but	not his VISOR; his eyes are not clouded and his temple	inputs aren't in place.					RIKER'S COM VOICE				(concerned)			Geordi... Have you found it yet?					GEORDI			Not yet...	He reaches a point where tendrils of SMOKE start to	appear from up ahead.					GEORDI				(continuing)			Starting to get fumes... Ammonia,			fluorine, potassium cyanide...	Geordi continues through the smoke -- starts COUGHING.2    INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS	Close on Riker's face as he reacts with concern to	Geordi's cough.3    INT. JEFFERIES TUBE - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)	Geordi stops coughing, continues climbing.					GEORDI				(continuing)			I can feel the heat from here.	He reaches a horizontal juncture and sees the fire down	the tube.					GEORDI				(continuing)			There it is!         STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - TEASER         1A.3    CONTINUED:	He enters the horizontal tube and starts toward the	fire.       STAR TREK: "Interface" - REV. 07/16/93 - TEASER       2.3    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER'S COM VOICE			How far?					GEORDI			About ten meters. Along the ODN			line. It's hot -- over two			thousand degrees.				(beat)			I'm going in.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Geordi, wait.	Incredibly, Geordi goes RIGHT INTO THE BLAZE; he	crosses to a panel and works some controls. We watch	for several incredible seconds as Geordi works,	seemingly impervious to the violent flames...	He trips a control and a plume of gas erupts, putting	out the fire.					GEORDI			We're okay... I've activated the			emergency supression system.	The walls of the room are streaked with black.4    INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS					GEORDI				(continuing)			It's under control.	Geordi is hooked up to a complex INTERFACE UNIT, a	sleek headpiece that connects to his VISOR terminals..	He is wearing a body-suit, with a half-dozen blinking	nodes at points that correspond to his meridians.	There is a complex control and monitoring console	several feet away.	DATA is monitoring the interface unit on Geordi's body;	BEVERLY is studying the console; RIKER is standing by,	watching Geordi.					BEVERLY				(off console)			All his vital functions are			completely normal.       STAR TREK: "Interface" - REV. 07/16/93 - TEASER       3.4    CONTINUED:					DATA			The interface unit is operating			within expected parameters.					RIKER			Why did he start coughing when he			went through the gasses?					BEVERLY				(shrugs)			Psychosomatic response.	When Geordi speaks, he obviously can't see his	colleagues, since his eyes are covered. So his voice	has a certain removed quality, as if talking to them	from a distance.					GEORDI			I feel like I'm actually here...			I mean there -- in the Jefferies			tube. I saw the smoke and I			couldn't help coughing.					DATA			No one else has reported so			complete a sensory experience.					BEVERLY			The interface is perfect for			Geordi because his VISOR inputs			allow the probe to transmit			information directly into his			cerebral cortex.	Riker nods his understanding.					RIKER			It looks like this is going to			work. Let's get the probe out of			the Jefferies tube and into the			launch bay before we reach Marijne			Seven.					GEORDI			Will do...5    INT. JEFFERIES TUBE - CONTINUOUS	Geordi goes to start down the tube ladder, but he has	trouble placing his foot on the lower rung.					GEORDI			Something's wrong. I'm having			trouble controlling my left leg.       STAR TREK: "Interface" - REV. 07/16/93 - TEASER       4.6    INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS	Geordi's left thigh appears to be twitching slightly.					RIKER				(to Beverly)			What is it?	Beverly is studying the interface monitor.					BEVERLY			The probe is designed to respond			to the movements Geordi intends to			make -- when his brain sends a			message to move his leg, the			interface moves the probe instead.					DATA			Apparently the gain on the tactile			sensors is too low; I will			increase the input.	Data makes an adjustment and Geordi's leg stops	twitching.					GEORDI			There it goes.7    INT. JEFFERIES TUBE - CONTINUOUS	Geordi successfully plants his left foot in the ladder	rung and starts down the tube.					GEORDI			I'm on my way down.7A   INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS	Riker is eyeing the apparatus.					RIKER			Why the body-suit?					DATA			It provides tactile sensations so			that Geordi will feel as if he is			in the same environment as the			probe.	Riker nods.         STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - TEASER         4A.7B   INT. ENGINEERING - CONTINUOUS	as Geordi leaves the Jefferies tube and crosses past	the pool table, he sees something offscreen that	startles him.8    INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS	Geordi has the same startled look on his face.					BEVERLY			What's wrong?	Geordi smiles, relaxes.					GEORDI			Nothing...       STAR TREK: "Interface" - REV. 07/16/93 - TEASER       5.9    INT. ENGINEERING - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)	Geordi is looking at "his" reflection in a glass panel --	only it's not him looking back. He sees THE PROBE --	a two-foot long metallic CYLINDER. Tiny force beams --	like pencil-thin needles of light -- project constantly	from its surface, sweeping over everything around it.					GEORDI				(continuing)			I just saw my reflection in a			panel.				(wry)			I forgot what a handsome guy I am.	Off Geordi's smile...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                STAR TREK: "Interface" - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT ONE      6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            10   EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	In orbit above a huge, greenish, Neptune-like planet.	The swirling, violent quality of its atmosphere can be	seen even from here.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log, Stardate 47215.5.			We are responding to a distress			call from the science vessel			Raman, which is apparently trapped			inside the turbulent atmosphere of			an unusual gas giant planet. We			will use an experimental interface			probe in our attempt to rescue it.11   INT. BRIDGE	Worf and the CON officer are at their posts.	PICARD ENTERS from his Ready Room and heads for the aft	science station where Riker, Data and Geordi are	working.	They're looking at an OKUDAGRAM that shows a cross-section	of the atmospheric layers of the planet. The	science ship is marked in one of the middle layers.					DATA			I have reviewed the vessel's			mission plans. The Raman was to			descend to the lower atmosphere,			eleven thousand kilometers below			its current position...	Data indicates two atmospheric layers deeper.					DATA				(continuing)			The crew was to sample the			atmosphere at that level, and then			return to a safer orbit.	Data indicates a position much higher than the ship's	present location.      STAR TREK: "Interface" - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT ONE      7.11   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Something must have happened down			there. Maybe the shields failed,			or they had an inversion reaction			in the nacelles.	Picard nods.					PICARD			Any life signs?					GEORDI			Our bio-sensors are useless --			there's too much interference in			the atmosphere.					RIKER			The crew might still be alive.			But we'll never be able to tell			from up here.					PICARD			Will the probe be able to transmit			through the interference?					DATA			The probe sends information via a			focused particle beam that should			be able to cut through the			interference.					GEORDI			But we may have to operate the			interface at near tolerance			levels.					PICARD			Will your nervous system be able			to handle that much sensory input?					GEORDI				(nods)			We've tested the interface at up			to seventy percent of tolerance.					RIKER			There shouldn't be a problem going			higher -- the safety override will			kick in at ninety-eight percent			tolerance and disengage the			interface.         STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - ACT ONE         8.12   INCLUDE WORF	as he glances up from his console.					WORF			Captain, I am receiving a			transmission from Starfleet			Command -- Admiral Holt.	Picard looks up at Worf, a little surprised at the	message.					PICARD			In my Ready Room.	Picard stands, turns back to the others.					PICARD				(continuing)			The seven people on that ship are			our first priority. Is the probe			ready for launch?					DATA			Yes, Sir.					PICARD			Send it directly to the aft			section of the Raman, through the			secondary air lock. That'll put			it one bulkhead away from the			Bridge.					GEORDI			I'll interface with the probe as			soon as it's in place and take it			in the rest of the way.					PICARD			Make it so.	Riker stays at the console, Geordi and Data start for	the Turbolift.         STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - ACT ONE         9.13   FOLLOW PICARD	as he crosses the Bridge and goes into the Ready Room.14   INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)	Picard steps around to the monitor on his desk.					PICARD			Onscreen.	ADMIRAL HOLT appears on the small screen. Picard	smiles -- they are on familiar terms.					PICARD				(continuing)			Hello, Marcus.					ADMIRAL HOLT			Jean-Luc.	The Admiral returns the smile, but it's a little	forced.					PICARD			How's life on DS-Three?					ADMIRAL HOLT			We're hosting this year's palio.			The Ferengi have already been			accused of trying to bribe the			Breen pilot into throwing the			race...	Picard smiles.					PICARD			Nothing unusual about that.					ADMIRAL HOLT				(nodding)			Nothing at all...	A beat. The Admiral's face becomes serious.					ADMIRAL HOLT				(continuing)			I wish I could say I was just			calling to catch up on things.				(beat)			Nine days ago, the Hera left here			on a routine courier mission. We			were in contact with them for five			of those days. Then the ship			disappeared without a trace.        STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - ACT ONE        10.14   CONTINUED:	Picard reacts strongly.					PICARD			The Hera?					ADMIRAL HOLT			I'm afraid so.	A long silent beat.					ADMIRAL HOLT			The Excelsior and the Noble have			spent the last seventy-two hours			retracing its course. Nothing.			I'm going to keep them at it for			seventy-two more.				(beat)			But to be honest, I don't think			another week would make any			difference.	Picard nods. Another long beat.					PICARD			I'll tell Commander La Forge...	OFF Picard's grim face.15   INT. LAB	Geordi is fiddling with the interface console as Data	is applying a pen-like instrument to the interface	unit, checking everything out.	The door opens and Picard steps over to where the pair	is working.      STAR TREK: "Interface" - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT ONE      11.15   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Mister Data, I need a word with			Commander La Forge.					DATA			Yes, Sir.				(to Geordi)			I will be on the Bridge.	Picard waits for Data to go out the door, then turns	back to Geordi.					PICARD			I've just spoken to Starfleet.				(gently)			The Hera is missing.	Geordi is stunned.					GEORDI			Missing... ?	Picard nods. Geordi then asks the question to which he	already seems to know the answer.					GEORDI			What about my mother... ?					PICARD			Captain La Forge has disappeared			along with the rest of her crew...	Geordi nods. OFF his grave expression.                                             FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                  STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - ACT TWO        12.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:16   INT. GEORDI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	Geordi is watching a message on the monitor from	CAPTAIN SILVA LA FORGE, Geordi's mother. She is	dressed in a red Starfleet uniform.					SILVA LA FORGE			-- I saw your father last week and			your sister about ten days before			that. I decided I missed my			favorite son...	Geordi smiles sadly at the inside joke.					GEORDI				(quietly to himself)			Your only son, Mom...					SILVA LA FORGE				(continuing)			You're going to have to see the			Hera again. We've got a lot of			new faces on board. Including a			chief engineer who juices up the			nacelles every chance she gets.			I think she's the best technician			in the fleet.				(smiles)			Okay, second best.	Geordi smiles to himself. The door suddenly CHIMES.	Geordi touches a control and FREEZES the recording of	his mother.					GEORDI			Come in...	The door opens and Riker steps inside the room. He	pauses when he sees the still frame of Geordi's mother	on the monitor.					RIKER			I didn't mean to interrupt.					GEORDI			Don't worry about it.	Geordi touches the console and the message continues.        STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - ACT TWO        13.16   CONTINUED:					SILVA LA FORGE			Maybe you should meet her. We're			going to be in the same sector			next week. Take a shuttle over			and I'll introduce you.					GEORDI				(to Riker)			Mom's always trying to find me a			wife.					SILVA LA FORGE			But if you're too busy, I'll see			you at your father's birthday			party. Remember, if you talk to			him -- it's a surprise.	She puts her finger to her lips in the "shush"	position. The message ends with the insignia of	Starfleet across the screen.					GEORDI				(to Riker)			This came in about three weeks			ago.				(beat)			I never got back to her...					RIKER				(gently)			Geordi, the probe has entered the			planet's atmosphere. I'm ready to			move it inside the ship.				(beat)			If you want to take a couple of			days off, I'll run the interface.					GEORDI			The interface is calibrated			specifically for my VISOR inputs.			You'd need at least ten hours to			convert it. Those crewmen down			there can't wait...					RIKER			The interface doesn't have to be			fully compatible. I could use it			right now. I wouldn't have the			control you'd have, but it would			still work.	Geordi reacts a little too strongly.        STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - ACT TWO        14.16   CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			Forget it. I'm the best one for			the job, and there's no reason not			to go ahead as planned.					RIKER				(gently)			The Hera is reason enough.					GEORDI			The Hera is missing. That's all.			Until I hear something more, my			mother might just as well have			taken the crew on an unscheduled			holiday.	Geordi stands.					GEORDI				(continuing)			Let's go.	He heads for the door. OFF the concern on Riker's face	as he turns to follow.17   INT. BRIDGE	Worf is at tactical, Riker is at aft science, Picard is	in his seat, and various N.D.s are at other posts.	Riker turns from his console.					RIKER			Sir, the probe is through the			airlock and in position aboard the			Raman.	Picard acknowledges with a nod.					PICARD			Picard to Commander Data.

However, there is so			much interference that it prevents			a positive lock.					RIKER			If we could set up some sort of			relay system...					DATA			That is my conclusion as well,			Commander. Two shuttlecraft,			staggered between the Enterprise			and the Raman, with their shields			adjusted to refocus the tractor			beam.        STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - ACT FOUR        40.47   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Can we get those shuttles close			enough without putting them in			danger?				(to Geordi)			Mister La Forge.					GEORDI				(shrugs)			I suppose so.				(beat)			Yes. As long as you keep them			above the troposphere, they'll be			alright.	Picard nods, turns to Data.					PICARD			In that case --					GEORDI				(interrupting)			What about the Hera?	Everyone turns to him.					GEORDI				(continuing)			We'll be leaving my mother and her			crew stranded on the planet.

They have a history of			strange side effects -- especially			if you start playing around with			them.	Picard glances at Data for confirmation.					DATA			There have been reports of warp			bubbles and other subspace			deformations.					GEORDI				(nodding)			So what if that's what happened?			Not a warp bubble, but a subspace			funnel.					DATA			Connecting two points through			subspace.					GEORDI				(nods)			The Hera could have accidentally			created a distortion that emptied			out right here, on Marijne Seven.	It seems unlikely to everyone but Geordi.					PICARD			Why here?					GEORDI			The Hera passed near this planet			just ten days ago. There's a lot			of subspace distortion in the			atmosphere -- the ship might've			picked up some residual traces			that directed the funnel back			here.					RIKER				(disbelieving)			And the Hera is still in one			piece, down on the surface?       STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - ACT FOUR       41A.47   CONTINUED: (3)					GEORDI			Maybe it's surrounded by some kind			of subspace field that's keeping			it together. But who knows for			how long?	Geordi looks absolutely convinced.					PICARD			Do you have any evidence to			support this... hypothesis?					GEORDI			I did get some strange subspace			readings when I was interfaced			with the probe.					RIKER			Geordi, that could be anything.        STAR TREK: "Interface" - 07/14/93 - ACT FOUR        42.47   CONTINUED: (4)					GEORDI			I talked to her. She asked me to			take the Raman closer to the			planet.	Picard turns to Data.					PICARD			Is any of this possible?	Data considers the fantastic story for a couple of	beats.					DATA			Yes.	Geordi smiles.					GEORDI			There.	Data seems conscious of not wanting to offend his	friend, but he still has to do his job.					DATA			However, I believe it is...				(hesitates)			unlikely.					PICARD			How unlikely?					DATA			Nearly impossible, Sir.	Picard nods, considers for a moment.					PICARD			Proceed with the shuttle plan.					GEORDI			Captain --					PICARD			-- Mister La Forge.
