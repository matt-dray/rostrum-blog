CORRIDOR	A turbolift door opens and TROI and a trembling twelve-	year-old boy, JAKE POTTS, emerge and head down the	corridor.					PICARD (V.O.)				(continuing)			It seems a young man's practical			joke has come dangerously close			to a lethal conclusion.2thru	OMITTED33A   INT.

More often than not, they			have unfortunate results.					TROI			I wouldn't be surprised if this			was his last practical joke for			a long while.        STAR TREK: "Brothers" - REV. 7/24/90 - TEASER        5.3A   CONTINUED: (4)					RIKER			I'm more concerned with his			brother's future at the moment,			Counselor.4    INT.
