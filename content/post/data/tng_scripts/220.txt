SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	Photon torpedoes burst from the forward tubes.2B   EXT.

BRIDGE					WORF			A direct hit, sir.					DATA			The asteroid has shattered.			However, the core is still intact			-- and still on a direct collision			course with Tessen Three.					RIKER			Is it big enough to be a threat?     STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - REV. 2/03/92 - TEASER     2.3    CONTINUED:					DATA			Yes, sir. It is of sufficient			size and density to cause			planetwide damage.					PICARD			Time to impact.					DATA			It will reach the upper			atmosphere in forty-four seconds			and impact with the planet eleven			seconds later.					RIKER			Ready torpedoes.					DATA			Sir, the core is composed of			densely compressed nitrium and			chrondite.

TROI'S OFFICE	WORF and his son ALEXANDER sit stiffly -- side by side	but separated by their anger at each other -- venting	it all before a patient TROI.					WORF			My instructions were clear!					ALEXANDER			They were not!					WORF			Before being allowed to play, he			was to put his soiled clothing			in the garment reprocessor.					ALEXANDER			I was not!					TROI			I sense a touch of hostility here,			gentlemen.					WORF			I specifically told you that!					ALEXANDER			You told it to me yesterday; not			today!					TROI			If I may suggest...					WORF			You know very well that the same			rules apply today that...    STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - REV. 2/04/92 - ACT ONE    5.9    CONTINUED:					TROI			Please!				(beat; on their silence)			Why not simply draw up a contract,			which defines the duties of each			family member?					ALEXANDER			You mean he tells me what he wants			and I have to do it.					TROI			No, it means you both agree on			your responsibilities. And when			you've done the things you've			agreed to do, then you've earned			the privilege of doing things you			want to do.				(to Worf)			When he's cleaned his room, for			instance, then maybe he's earned			a visit to the holodeck to fight			his alien monsters.					WORF			You suggest bribery?					TROI			I suggest working out an equitable			system where the rules are spelled			out as clearly as possible. For			the child and the parent. You			must list your responsibilities,			too.				(to Alexander)			What would you like your father			to promise?					ALEXANDER			No yelling.					WORF				(loudly)			I do not yell.					TROI			Then you should have no trouble			with that part.	She looks from one to the other.    STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - REV. 2/04/92 - ACT ONE    6.9    CONTINUED: (2)					TROI			Well. Why don't you both go back			to your quarters and talk it over?			Decide on the points each of you			wants in the contract...					WORF				(beat; grumpy)			Very well.	Alexander's answer is a noncommital shrug. Troi	smiles, with:					TROI			One day you'll be glad your father			cared enough about you to insist			on rules. It may seem hard to			imagine right now... but			eventually, most children come			to appreciate their parents.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Riker to Counselor Troi. Your			mother's just come aboard.	Troi hears this, takes it in... then...					TROI			On the other hand...					LWAXANA'S COM VOICE			Deanna, my dear... it's mother!10   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM ONE	A Supernumerary stands alongside LWAXANA and MISTER	HOMN. As she absently gestures Mister Homn to get	a move on with the abundance of luggage he carries,	she twines RIKER'S arm in hers.					LWAXANA				(effervescing; into com)			And I've got such deliciously			exciting news, you're going to			be absolutely thrilled! I'm			getting married!       STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE       7.11   OMITTED12   INT. TEN-FORWARD	Troi and Lwaxana are seated -- Troi initially	immobilized by her shock.					LWAXANA				(peering around)			You know, with just a bit of			redecorating here and there, this			Ten-Forward room should make a			very nice wedding hall.					TROI			I beg your pardon?					LWAXANA			My dear, where else? Among all			my good friends... in the presence			of my adored daughter...					TROI			Mother, where did you... when did			you meet this man? Who is he?			I mean... marriage. When did all			this happen?					LWAXANA			Ah, my poor plodding little			Deanna, with her questions			questions questions. Wherever			did you inherit such pedestrian			genes? What matters, my sweet,			is that your mother's happy.					TROI			Mother, if you're happy, then I'm			happy for you. I only asked who			this man is, and where you met			him. Those are not unusual			questions.					LWAXANA			He's a wonderful man, my dear;			he has such good breeding, I tell			you, he's absolute perfection.					TROI			Who is he?      STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE      7A.12   CONTINUED:					LWAXANA			He is Campio; third minister to			the Conference Of Judges on the			planet Kostolain. Royalty, my			dear; naturally.					TROI			Naturally. I didn't know you'd			ever been to Kostolain. Or was			he on some diplomatic mission to			Betazed... ?					LWAXANA			Well, neither, actually. I			haven't exactly met him yet,			really. Oh, but the profiles			we've exchanged. They're in such			accord that you'd absolutely weep,			my dear; you'd weep at the harmony			between us.       STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE       8.12   CONTINUED: (2)					TROI			Mother. Don't you think you			should at least meet the man			you're going to marry before			committing to spend the rest of			your life with him?					LWAXANA			Deanna, I love you, but you do			make everything sound like an			epitaph.13   INCLUDING WORF & ALEXANDER	as they ENTER. Heading for Troi's table, they're	locked in animated debate.					ALEXANDER			I don't want to agree!					WORF			You have to agree. That's what			an agreement is.				(to Troi)			Excuse the intrusion, Counselor,			but we are having some difficulty			drawing up our contract.				(nods to Lwaxana)			Mrs. Troi.					ALEXANDER			He isn't fair!					WORF			The boy is unreasonable.					LWAXANA				(liking Alex)			Well of course he's unreasonable;			he's a child.				(chucks Alex under chin)			And such a child. Making little			boys reasonable only gives them			pimples.					TROI			Alexander, this is my mother.       STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE       9.13   CONTINUED:					LWAXANA			Alexander! What a wonderful name.			I once knew a tall, handsome			warrior named Alexander who			utterly adored me. We went			everywhere; simply everywhere.			Have you been anywhere yet?				(abruptly; to Troi)			Contract? What contract?					TROI			It's between father and son. A			fair and balanced way of achieving			a mutual sense of order.					LWAXANA				(to Alex)			How ghastly for you.				(to Worf)			And you're doing this to your own			child, Mister Woof?					TROI			Mother!					WORF			It is Worf, Madam.					LWAXANA			Contracts are usually for people			who don't really trust each other.				(to Worf)			A child who is trusted becomes			worthy of that trust.					TROI			Mother, will you kindly stay out			of this?					LWAXANA				(to Worf)			If he doesn't perform his			contractual duties, I assume he			would be chastised?					WORF			He would be... sanctioned, yes.					LWAXANA			But if you fail to perform your			duties, what's the child supposed			to do about it?      STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE      10.13   CONTINUED: (2)					TROI			Mother, will you please!					WORF			I, not perform my duty?!					LWAXANA			Alexander. Life's true gift is			the capacity to enjoy enjoyment.			Now...	She draws Alexander gently toward her; leans to put	herself almost nose-to-nose with the boy -- cupping	his little chin in her hand, as:					LWAXANA (cont'd)			... Have I arrived too late, or...				(grins warmly)			... Can you still smile?	And, still nose-to-nose with the smiling Lwaxana, 	Alexander grins from ear to ear. An unmistakable and 	very personal one-on-one bonding here. Friendship.14   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE TURBOLIFT	Picard and Riker move along the corridor, during:					PICARD			Married? She's getting married?					RIKER			If we hold present course, we'll			rendezvous with her intended groom			in thirty-one hours.					PICARD			I will not continue to have this			ship used by that woman for her			convenience, simply because her			daughter is one of my officers.					RIKER			Apparently, Deanna's being aboard			was only part of the reason.					PICARD			The other part being?      STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE      11.14   CONTINUED:					RIKER			She seems to think that the honor			of giving away the bride should			belong to you.					PICARD				(halts, musing; resumes				 walking)			Permission for an on-board wedding			is granted, Number One. Nothing			would please me more than giving			Mrs. Troi away.15   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	As Picard and Riker recede into b.g. along the	corridor, CAMERA discovers -- along a seam of ceiling	in f.g. -- a moving line of the Twinkling Particles	seen earlier outside the ship. As it moves, the line	drips, like drops of sparkling liquid, through the air	to the flooring, where it forms a sort of glittering	puddle. Beat -- then it disappears downward through	the flooring itself.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - 2/03/92 - ACT ONE      12.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:16   EXT.

And how			are you this morning?	Alex, staring sadly at the floor, just shrugs in	response.					LWAXANA				(gently)			Oh, I see.	And, having dropped her usual off-handed effervescence,	she sits quietly down beside him.					LWAXANA			Being punished for something, are			we?					ALEXANDER			It's just my regular time with			Counselor Troi. She's not here			yet.					LWAXANA			You came early. Well, that's very			responsible of you.					ALEXANDER			No, I just wanted to be out of			my room before...				(shrugs)					LWAXANA			Before what?				(beat)			Now if we're going to be real			friends, we have to share only			the truth.      STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - 2/03/92 - ACT TWO      13.17   CONTINUED:					ALEXANDER			Why?					LWAXANA			Well for one thing, it's easier.			When you tell the truth, you never			have to remember later what you			lied about.	Alex doesn't particularly want to smile -- but he can't	help it.					LWAXANA (cont'd)			But mostly, a true friend is a			person you can always tell the			truth to without worrying about			it.					ALEXANDER			I wanted to leave before my father			got back.					LWAXANA			Ah.					ALEXANDER			I hate him. I wish my mother was			here.				(angrily)			But she died.	She gently hugs Alexander to her, without overwhelming	him.					LWAXANA			And that's not very fair, is it?					ALEXANDER			All he cares about are rules.			I'm supposed to do everything			right all the time.				(wilting; blurts:)			And I don't know how!	He buries his head against her. She hugs him more	firmly; more securely.					LWAXANA			Tell you the truth, little			warrior, neither do I.					(MORE)      STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - 2/03/92 - ACT TWO      14.17   CONTINUED: (2)					LWAXANA (cont'd)			But I do know one marvelous thing			you can do with rules.	Taking his hand in hers, she rises and heads for the	exit, as:					ALEXANDER				(unsure)			I'm supposed to wait for Counselor			Troi.					LWAXANA				(mischievous Grin)			Exactly.	And they're out of there.18   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOLODECK	Lwaxana and Alexander are headed for the (o.s.)	holodeck.					LWAXANA			I'll bet you've never been to the			colony of free spirits.					ALEXANDER			What do they do there?					LWAXANA			Whatever they want. Artists,			philosophers, free-thinkers...	She leans and tweaks his nose a little, as:					LWAXANA (cont'd)			... people who don't quite fit			other people's rules. Personally,			I come for the mudbaths. You'll			adore the mudbaths.				(at Holodeck door)			Computer? I'm assuming you have			the Parallax Colony of Shiralea			VI?					COMPUTER VOICE			That program is available.					LWAXANA			Then run it for us, dear.	As Lwaxana leads Alexander through the door, we go to:    STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - REV. 2/12/92 - ACT TWO    15.19   EXT.

She brings it	up close to her mouth, and, exhaling deeply, uses her	breath (which catches fire) to create a lovely fire	design in the air before it finally disappears.21   RESUME - LWAXANA & ALEXANDER	Alexander is wide-eyed at the (o.s.) sight.					LWAXANA			Fire sculptor. We'll chat with			her later if you're not wearing			anything flammable.    STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - REV. 2/12/92 - ACT TWO    16.22   INCLUDING JUGGLER	as he ENTERS both FRAME and the conversation.	Constantly juggling several multicolored, variously	sized balls.					JUGGLER			A few of us were just gathering			together for our laughing hour.			Would you care to come laugh with			us?					LWAXANA			Actually, we were about to			experience a mudbath.					JUGGLER			Were you! What an idea! My			friends and I will join you.			One can always...				(beat)			... laugh in the bath.    STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - REV. 2/12/92 - ACT TWO    17.22   CONTINUED:					ALEXANDER				(re: balls)			Do you ever drop one?					JUGGLER			No, no, no. They are my worlds,			and I protect them. I am a master			of worlds, and they fly only as			I wish.23   INCLUDING YOUNG MAN & WOMAN	Emerging from behind a structure are a YOUNG, extremely	attractive (humanoid) MAN & WOMAN.					JUGGLER				(to Young Couple)			We're having guests for laughing			hour. Come join us!					YOUNG MAN			We'd love to!					YOUNG WOMAN			No, thank you.					YOUNG MAN				(pleasantly)			Yes.    STAR TREK: "Cost of Living" - REV. 2/05/92 - ACT TWO    18.23   CONTINUED:					YOUNG WOMAN				(pleasantly)			No.					YOUNG MAN			Why do you always say "no" when			I say "yes"?					YOUNG WOMAN			I don't.					YOUNG MAN			You just did.					YOUNG WOMAN			There you go again. You are the			most negative person!	They will continue arguing (o.s.), as:					ALEXANDER			Why are they arguing like that?					JUGGLER			They're friends.
