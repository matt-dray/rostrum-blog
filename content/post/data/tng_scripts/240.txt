It	looks like she's having a nightmare.	With a sudden, terrified GASP, her eyes SNAP WIDE OPEN.                                             REVEAL:2    INT.

The room stays dark.					TROI				(louder)			Computer, turn on the lights.	Again, nothing happens.	Deanna clutches her head and moans. She moves off the	bed... and almost immediately bumps into something.	She reacts, surprised; clearly, this is not the room	she's familiar with. She finds a wall and begins to	feel her way along it.	Eventually, her hands find a control panel. She taps	several buttons before A LIGHT TURNS ON.	REVEAL that Deanna is standing in a set of quart rs on	a Romulan Warbird. The room is spartan in nature, but	the Romulan Imperial Seal is clearly visible on a wall.	Troi is in front of a dresser, staring into a mirror.	She runs her hands over her face, her eyebrows, her	ears, as her reflection stares back in utter disbelief.	She looks like a Romulan.                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE     2.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:           (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)            3    EXT. SPACE - THE ROMULAN WARBIRD (OPTICAL)	at warp.4    INT. WARBIRD - TROI'S QUARTERS	Deanna has not yet recovered from the shock of her	transformation. She is groggy and disoriented. She's	dressed in the uniform of a Romulan officer, but it's	somewhat different from the ones we've seen in the	past. The color is brighter and there is a distinctive	insignia on her right shoulder.	Suddenly, the DOOR OPENS and a Romulan officer, SUBCOMMANDER	N'VEK, ENTERS (he wears the standard Romulan	uniform). Deanna tenses, instantly on her guard as	N'Vek moves towards her.					N'VEK			Good, you're awake.					TROI				(woozy)			Who... are you?					N'VEK			Please, Counselor, there is little			time. The Commander will be			calling for you at any moment.	N'Vek moves quickly and efficiently, and there is an	underlying urgency in his voice. He takes out a tech	device and adjusts it. He tries to bring it near	Deanna's face, but she pushes at his arm, keeping the	device away from her.					TROI			Where am I?					N'VEK			You are aboard the Imperial			Romulan Warbird Khazara. I am Sub-Commander			N'Vek.	Deanna is confused, uncertain what to do next.     STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE     3.4    CONTINUED:					TROI			Warbird?	She tries to make sense of this. N'Vek begins scanning	her with the tech device. Troi is still disoriented as	she tries to make sense of her situation.					TROI			I was at the neuro-psychology			seminar on Bokara-Six. The last			thing I remember was returning to			my quarters. I was...				(unsure)			...attacked. I felt a...			hypospray?					N'VEK			It was necessary. I could not be			certain you would come			voluntarily.					TROI			My head... is still spinning...					N'VEK			There are drugs in your system,			but they've nearly dissipated.			The disorientation will pass.					TROI			Why have you brought me here?					N'VEK			Listen to me carefully.				(beat)			You are no longer Deanna Troi.			You are Major Rakal of the Tal			Shiar, the Imperial Intelligence.			Commander Toreth will--					TROI			Am I a prisoner?  STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - REV. 11/19/92 - ACT ONE  4.4    CONTINUED: (2)					N'VEK			No. There is no time to explain			everything. You must listen.				(beat)			Commander Toreth will want to know			your mission. Tell her nothing.			Simply instruct her to proceed to			the Kaleb sector, course one-oh-two			mark four.					TROI			The Kaleb sector...					N'VEK			Repeat it... heading one-oh-two			mark four.					TROI			Heading... one-oh-two mark four...				(beat)			She'll... take orders... from me?					N'VEK			You are an officer of the Tal			Shiar. She will obey you. But do			not push her too far.	We hear a BEEP and N'Vek stiffens instantly.					TORETH'S COM VOICE			Sub-Commander N'Vek. We are			approaching the loading point.			Bring our guest to the Bridge.	N'Vek taps a com device.					N'VEK			Yes, Commander. Immediately.	N'Vek begins hurriedly adjusting Troi's uniform, making	certain everything looks correct. He hands her a	disruptor.					N'VEK				(urgently)			Please, we must hurry.					TROI			I'm not going anywhere... tell me			what this is about.					N'VEK			You are a Starfleet officer			disguised as a Romulan. Unless			you trust me and do exactly as I			have said... Toreth will discover			you -- and you will be killed.  STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - REV. 11/19/92 - ACT ONE  5.4    CONTINUED: (4)					TROI			How do I know I won't be killed			anyway?	He regards her intently for a moment.					N'VEK			Your only chance to get off this			ship alive is to do as I say.				(beat)			You are an empath. You would know			if I am lying. Am I?	She studies him carefully for a beat, then	acknowledges.					TROI			No.					N'VEK			Then let us go see the Commander.	N'Vek moves to the door which OPENS. Troi stands still	for a beat... but there's only one possible decision.	She follows N'Vek out and they EXIT.                                             CUT TO:5    EXT. SPACE - THE WARBIRD (OPTICAL)	as it enters orbit around a planet.6    INT. THE WARBIRD - BRIDGE	Several N.D. ROMULANS attend various stations around	the perimeter. A single PILOT sits at a console in	front of the main Viewscreen. The Commander's station	is against the back wall. It is not a chair, but a	raised platform upon which the Commander stands. It's	encircled by a railing to lean on and several command	consoles. The entire room is forward of the Commander.	Every inch of the Bridge is under her surveillance at	all times -- and nothing goes on behind her back.	COMMANDER TORETH is a woman with a regal bearing and	the grim look of a soldier who has seen many battles.	She stands on her platform, watching the Viewscreen.	Troi and N'Vek ENTER and move toward Toreth's station	where they wait. Toreth pointedly ignores them both.    STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE    5A.6    CONTINUED:					PILOT			Orbit established, Commander.					TORETH			You may commence loading the			cargo. Notify me when the			transfer is complete.					PILOT			Yes, sir.	She silently surveys the Bridge for another moment	before she turns to notice them. The moment she does,	N'Vek speaks up.					N'VEK			Sir, may I present Major Rakal of			the Tal Shiar.	Toreth fixes her gaze on Troi. It is a long,	scrutinizing moment. She neither salutes nor extends	her hand in greeting. After a moment --     STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE     6.6    CONTINUED: (2)					N'VEK				(to Troi)			This is Commander Toreth.	Troi inclines her head slightly.					TORETH				(to N'Vek)			Attend to your station.	It is an abrupt but absolute dismissal, issued without	ever looking at him. N'Vek withdraws to a nearby	station, trying to keep an eye on Troi, who is now	alone in the lion's den.					TORETH			Why are you here without your			guards?	Troi hesitates, not sure of the right answer.					TORETH			Well?					TROI				(carefully)			The mission is one of utmost			secrecy. I could not... risk...			bringing guards.	Toreth eyes her... she senses uncertainty and weakness:	this Intelligence Officer can be pushed.					TORETH			And exactly what is the nature of			this clandestine assignment?	Again, Troi hesitates. She's had no briefing on any of	this; she's flying blind.					TROI			I... cannot reveal that.					TORETH			Oh? Why not?  STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - REV. 11/23/92 - ACT ONE  7.6    CONTINUED: (3)					TROI			I am under orders.	Toreth moves toward her, circling, appraising -- a move	intended to intimidate.					TORETH			You don't act like a member of the			Tal Shiar. How long have you been			with Intelligence?					TROI				(beat)			Several months.	A smile curls on Toreth's lips... she is feeling less	threatened by this unintimidating officer.					TORETH			Ah.					PILOT				(interrupting)			Commander, the cargo is on board			and secured.	Toreth notes the information but her attention remains	fixed on Troi.					TORETH			Tell me... is there a reason why			the Commander of the ship is being			kept ignorant of its cargo?					TROI			I don't know what you mean...  STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - REV. 11/23/92 - ACT ONE  8.6    CONTINUED: (4)					TORETH			I've been ordered to take on			cargo... but its contents are			unknown to me. Does that seem			wise?	Troi does not respond.					TORETH				(continuing)			I am responsible for the safety of			this ship and its crew. How do I			know this cargo is safe to			transport?					TROI			I'm sure it is safe. Otherwise it			would not have been loaded.	Toreth's eyes sparkle with dark amusement. She begins	to circle the Bridge, including every member of the	crew in her indictment of the Tal Shiar.					TORETH			Ah. Because the Tal Shiar is so			deeply concerned with the safety			and well-being of the military...	There are a few grim smiles at this from the others.					TORETH			I'm sure every person on this			Bridge could offer testimony about			personal experiences with the Tal			Shiar... and I doubt that many			would recall those encounters as			tender and caring...	Toreth is gaining strength and confidence. She clearly	feels that this Intelligence officer is an insect to be	brushed away.					TORETH			So you will forgive me, Major, if			I am hesitant to accept your			assurances that the cargo is no			danger to my crew.	She walks right up to Troi and stares at her, issuing	a challenge.					TORETH			I intend to open those containers --    STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE    8A.6    CONTINUED: (5)	Troi takes a beat to look around the Bridge... heads	have turned to see how this Major will react to this	confrontation. Her glance brushes over N'Vek, who is	struggling not to give anything away. Troi realizes	she is dangerously close to losing control of the	situation, and must quickly re-establish her authority.	She's still weak and groggy, she has no idea what she's	doing here, and she knows she's in immense danger. But	she'd better find an inner strength. She turns to	Toreth, her eyes dark and her tone hard.					TROI			That cargo is the property of the			Tal Shiar. You will not touch it.	But Toreth hasn't given up yet.					TORETH			By whose authority?					TROI			Mine. And if you do not wish to			undergo another "personal			experience" with the Tal Shiar, I			suggest you not question me again.	Toreth stiffens slightly. The insect is stinging back.					TROI			Commander Toreth... you will now			proceed on course bearing one-oh-two			mark four to the Kaleb sector.					TORETH			The Kaleb sector is virtually			deserted. Why would we go there?	Troi looks Toreth directly in the eye.					TROI			Because those are your orders.	Toreth meets Troi's gaze impassively for a long beat.	Finally, she turns to the pilot.					TORETH			Pilot, set course. Bearing one-oh-two			mark four. Warp six.					PILOT			Yes, Commander.    STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE    8B.6    CONTINUED: (6)	In the b.g., N'Vek relaxes visibly.

WARBIRD - WARD ROOM	This is a Conference/Officer's Room which is connected	by a set of doors to the Bridge. Toreth, N'Vek, and	two N.D. ROMULAN OFFICERS are seated at a table. A	large meal is spread out before them. The Commander	and her officers are friends, and the atmosphere is	relaxed.					TORETH			... and we had been told that the			Klingon outpost was undefended.			So when their warships decloaked,			they took us completely by			surprise...    STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO    19.15   CONTINUED:	The DOORS OPEN and Troi ENTERS. In an instant, the two	N.D. officers tense up, completely on edge. Toreth	indicates an open seat and continues her story.	Troi bows her head slightly and sits.					TORETH				(continuing)			... The Klingons destroyed half my			squadron before we could even			return fire. But when we did...			they were no match for us. I			destroyed their flagship myself.			I received the Sotarek Citation			for my actions that day.				(beat, pointedly)			The Intelligence Officer in charge			of the mission was executed.	The words are followed by an uncomfortable silence.					TORETH			Major. Welcome to our table.					TROI			Commander.					TORETH			I suggest you try the viinerine.			It's quite good.	Troi is suddenly put on the spot. She has no idea	which of the various dishes Viinerine actually is...	but there's no time to try to figure it out. She picks	up a dish at random and begins spooning some of it onto	her plate. Toreth smiles mildly.					TORETH			I realize it's nothing compared to			what you're accustomed to on			Romulus... but you could at least			try the viinerine...	Troi has picked the wrong dish. She quickly tries to	cover her mistake and does not stop serving as she	speaks.					TROI			I've smelled better viinerine on			prison ships.					TORETH			No doubt.  STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - REV. 11/20/92 - ACT TWO  20.15   CONTINUED: (2)	They all continue to eat in silence for a beat.

If so, it has escaped			me.	Toreth flares slightly, stung.					TORETH			Commander Konsab believes that, in			order to function, military			officers have to trust each other.			Members of the Tal Shiar, on the			other hand, trust no one. They			expect deception, so they always			find it.					TROI			You've made your opinion of the			Tal Shiar quite clear, Commander.					TORETH			I hope so.	The tension level between Troi and Toreth cranks up a	notch. Troi feels she must not back down in order to	maintain credibility.					TROI			We ensure the loyalty of the			people. Do you believe the Empire			would be better off without our			protection?	Troi has pushed a sore spot.					TORETH			Protection? From whom? Was the			Empire threatened by the words of			an old man, a devoted citizen who			merely tried to speak his mind?			How did the Tal Shiar protect the			Empire by dragging my father from			our home in the middle of the			night?	This is extremely hard for Troi. She can feel Toreth's	intensity and anger, and she sympathizes with her. But	Troi can't let it show... she has to play her role.					TROI			Clearly, your father was a			traitor.    STAR TREK: "Face of the Enemy" - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO    22.15   CONTINUED: (4)					TORETH			No. He was just an idealistic old			man... and I never saw him again.	Beat.					TROI			I don't need your devotion,			Commander. Just your obedience.					TORETH			That is all you have.	A long, silent beat is interrupted by the COM.					PILOT'S COM VOICE			Commander.
