SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	coming out of warp.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 45236.4.			As I study the intelligence			reports on Ambassador Spock's			disappearance, I cannot help but			feel a deeper, more personal			concern about this mission, for			I know this man through his			father. It was barely a year ago			that I shared a mind meld with			the Vulcan Sarek... now we must			meet again as I attempt to find			an explanation for his son's			actions.	(Part of the log can fall over the following --)5A   INT. ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Moving along several PADDs spread out across the	table... as well as other reports... clearly Picard	has been doing a great deal of homework... but as we	find him he is musing, staring out the window at the	stars... Riker ENTERS...					RIKER			We'll be coming into orbit of			Vulcan in less than an hour,			Captain... you may want to get			some rest...					PICARD			Yes, yes, of course, you're			right...	But he doesn't get up, his eye is caught by another	PADD on his desk... he's tired, but his mind is busy...     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT ONE     5.5A   CONTINUED:					PICARD			We should notify Sarek's wife of			our plans...					RIKER			All taken care of, sir... she'll			be transporting aboard at oh-seven			hundred...					PICARD			And Sarek?					RIKER			She says he is too ill to join			her.					PICARD				(nods)			Not unexpected. The man is dying.			And I have the... honor... to			bring him the news that his son			may have betrayed the Federation.	Riker sits.					RIKER			How well do you know Spock?					PICARD			I met him only once... what I know			of him comes from history books			and of course the mind meld with			his father...					RIKER			That must cover a lot of ground...     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT ONE     6.5A   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			Not as much as you'd imagine...			Sarek and Spock...	He pauses, inclined not to go any deeper into this...					PICARD			... Well, sometimes, fathers and			sons...	He doesn't need to finish...					RIKER				(from personal				 experience)			Understood.	Picard nods, rises and Riker follows suit... Picard	gets an additional thought... he picks up a PADD...					PICARD			Oh there was one other thing...			take a look at this...	Hands it to Riker, who glances at it, raises an	eyebrow...					PICARD			Something that turned up during			the intelligence sweep... what			do you make of it?					RIKER				(re: the PADD)			Metal fragments, possibly			disassembled components,			identified as Vulcan... recovered			from a downed Ferengi ship...					PICARD			And the crates they were in were			marked as medical supplies.					RIKER			Contraband?	Picard shakes his head, doesn't know... as they EXIT...     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt.

Starfleet has			requested we lend them a hand...	Riker acknowledges and they're out...5B   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit of Vulcan.6    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	Picard waits with a TRANSPORTER OFFICER as PERRIN	MATERIALIZES on the pad. She walks forward, extending	her arms, obviously glad to see Picard again. She is	as lovely and gracious as ever, her eyes holding the	only clue to the pain she carries from Sarek's illness.					PERRIN			Captain Picard...					PICARD			Perrin...	They shake hands and start toward the door.					PERRIN			It's good to see you again.     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     7.6    CONTINUED:					PICARD			And you. How is Sarek?	They EXIT the transporter room.7    INT. CORRIDOR	as they walk toward a turbolift.					PERRIN			He has good days... and bad days.			More and more they're bad...					PICARD			Then the disease has progressed...					PERRIN			It is a cruel killer. Sarek			deserves a noble death... instead			he is trapped in this lingering			madness...					PICARD			It must be very hard for you.	She casts him a swift glance. Not many people ever	think of her feelings, her needs. She is grateful for	Picard's sensitivity.					PERRIN			Every day I can share with him			is a gift. The pain will be in			losing him.					PICARD			I hope that will not be soon.					PERRIN			There's no way to tell. At times			I think he won't make it through			another night... and then it seems			he's strong enough to live for			years...	They walk quietly for a beat, then --					PICARD			I admire your strength more than			I can tell you.	Again, she gives him a sidelong glance, but he's	looking straight ahead. They walk on in silence.     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     8.8    INT. READY ROOM	Picard is at the replicator, just removing two cups	of tea. He gives her a cup of steaming tea and she	takes it, inhaling the vapor.					PERRIN			Mint tea... it's been years since			I've had it... Vulcans have some			strange concoction they call			"mint"... but you wouldn't			recognize it...	She sips at it, turning away to look out the windows.	Picard regards her for a moment, realizing she is	reluctant to get into discussion of the real purpose	of his visit. But he has no such luxury.					PICARD			Perrin... you know why I've come			to Vulcan.	She seems to stiffen a moment, doesn't turn around,	doesn't answer.					PICARD			I must ask you about Spock.	Now she turns, and there's a bitterness in her eyes	that can't be concealed.					PERRIN			He didn't even say good-bye to			his father before he left.					PICARD			Is it possible he was abducted?					PERRIN			No. He wrapped up his affairs			very carefully. He knew he was			going.					PICARD			Do you have any idea why he might			have disappeared like this?	Perrin drills him a look, works to get under control.	This whole subject is clearly a sore spot with her.     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     9.8    CONTINUED:					PERRIN			Captain, as far as I'm concerned			he disappeared a long time ago.	She rises, trying to contain her emotions...					PERRIN			Excuse me for sounding like the			wicked stepmother...					PICARD			Would it be inappropriate to ask			what happened between you and			Spock?					PERRIN			Not between us. Between Spock			and his father. They had argued			for years; that was family...			but when the debates over the			Cardassian war began, he attacked			Sarek's position... publicly...			he showed no loyalty to his			father...					PICARD			I was not aware that Sarek was			offended by Spock's opposition...					PERRIN			I was offended. And I made sure			Spock knew it.				(beat, softer)			I am very protective of my			husband. I do not apologize for			it.	A beat.					PICARD			Would Sarek have any idea why			Spock might have left?	Perrin turns and walks away from him, pauses at a	distance, hesitates before answering. If it were	anyone else, she would never become so personal, so	revealing...     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     9A.8    CONTINUED: (2)					PERRIN			I don't know.				(beat)			If you could see Sarek as I do...			wasting in bed... whispering to			himself...	She turns back to Picard, in anguish.					PERRIN			He wants to see his son... to heal			any rifts that still remain...			but now it may be too late.	Her voice breaks and she turns away, not wanting to	lose control in front of Picard. He is sobered by her	distress.					PICARD				(gently)			Perrin... would you allow me to			see Sarek?	She turns back, suffering in her eyes. Hesitates.					PERRIN			If it were anyone else... I would			never permit it.	A beat as she looks into his eyes. Deciding --     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT ONE     10.8    CONTINUED: (3)					PERRIN			But you are a part of him... and			he of you...	And on Picard's reaction...8A   INT. CARGO BAY	Riker and GEORDI stand looking over an unusual scene.	Spread out on the floor of the bay are fragments of	metal -- big, small, irregular, symmetrical, most of	them charred and twisted beyond recognition.	SUPERNUMERARIES, with tricorders, scanners, etc. are	moving the fragments around, trying to arrange them	into a cohesive pattern. In evidence are the broken	remains of the containers which once housed the	fragments.					RIKER			The Vulcans can't figure out what			these fragments are... but			they've identified the metal as			a dentarium alloy.					GEORDI			That pretty well indicates			that they're Vulcan...				(beat)			And dentarium also means that			whatever this was, it was designed			for use in space.	A beat as he inspects various pieces...					GEORDI			From the look of the damage,			must've been a high-speed impact.					RIKER				(acknowledges)			A Ferengi cargo shuttle that went			down in the Hanolin asteroid			belt... the debris was spread over			one hundred square kilometers.	Riker and Geordi pick their way through the strange	assortment of metal chunks. Riker picks up part of	a damaged container. Geordi picks up a metal fragment,	plays his tricorder on it.    STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE    10A.8A   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Could it be a weapons array?					RIKER			That was my first thought. But			the Vulcans don't have any record			of stolen weapons. Or stolen			parts, for that matter.	Geordi surveys the mess, shaking his head.					GEORDI			This is gonna be like putting			together a big jig-saw puzzle when			you don't know what the picture			is supposed to be.	Riker acknowledges and as both men begin to seek a way	to organize the wreckage...9    OMITTED10   INT. SAREK'S CEREMONIAL DEATH CHAMBER	Sarek rests on a raised bed in an otherwise Spartan	room. His head, resting on a pillow, is turned toward	sunlight. Tears have coursed a pattern on his face	and dried in rivulets. His mouth moves faintly, but	no sound emerges. Perrin and Picard stand at the	doorway, Picard noticeably shocked by this	deterioration in Sarek's condition.					PERRIN			He's like this most of the time...			his emotions have taken over.	She moves toward the bed, followed by Picard. Sarek's	lips keep moving.					PERRIN			Sometimes I can bring him out of			it.	She reaches the bed, leans in to her husband. When	she speaks it is sharply, harshly, demandingly.					PERRIN			Sarek! You will listen!	Sarek snarls in rage, anger suddenly replacing pathos.     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     11.10   CONTINUED:					SAREK			Go from me!					PERRIN			Picard is here.	In reply, Sarek pounds his fists on the bed.					SAREK			No -- more -- chaos!	Perrin turns to Picard.					PERRIN			I'll leave you alone. He'll			either acknowledge you... or he			won't.	He nods and she EXITS. Picard is alone with the	furious man. He takes his cue from Perrin, and speaks	firmly, authoritatively.					PICARD			Sarek, I have come a long way to			see you.					SAREK			I will not answer -- !					PICARD			I must speak to you about your			son...					SAREK			I want no one with me --					PICARD			About Spock.	Sarek suddenly goes silent. He doesn't look at Picard,	and there is no indication that he truly understands.	But then his head slowly turns, his eyes focus on	Picard. When he speaks, his voice is quiet.					SAREK			Spock?					PICARD			Yes. He's missing.	A flicker in Sarek's eyes as he moves into the reality	of the present, recognition dawning.     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     12.10   CONTINUED: (2)					SAREK			Is that you, Picard... ?					PICARD			Yes, my friend.					SAREK			You came here... to Vulcan...					PICARD			I need your help. I must find			Spock.	Tears spring to Sarek's eyes as his emotions overcome	him once more. He lets out a sob, then struggles for	the precious control that is so elusive.					SAREK			He is not here...					PICARD			I know. He is reported on			Romulus.	Sarek fixes him with a hard look. He is trying to	regain control, concentrate on the moment, even though	it costs him considerable effort.					SAREK			On Romulus... why?					PICARD			That's what I hope to find out			from you.					SAREK			On Romulus...	He is silent for a moment, musing. When he looks at	Picard again, his eyes are clear.					SAREK			You're going there, aren't you?			To find him.					PICARD			Yes.	Sarek rises now, sits upright. It is as though purpose	has given him focus.     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     13.10   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			Have you any idea what might have			taken him to Romulus?					SAREK			No.					PICARD			Is there anyone on Romulus that			he might know... or choose to			contact?	A vague memory stirs for Sarek.					SAREK			Pardek...					PICARD			Who is Pardek?					SAREK			It could be Pardek...					PICARD			Who is Pardek?	Sarek gets out of bed. He is becoming energized.					SAREK			He is a Romulan Senator. Spock			has maintained a relationship with			him over the years... I don't know			where they met.
