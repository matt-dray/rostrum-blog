A VULCAN and ONE WOMAN are seated,	holding their instruments -- a violin and a viola.	O'BRIEN tunes his cello. DATA ENTERS carrying a	violin. He checks at the door, startled to see the	captain.

My rendition will			be less enjoyable.					PICARD			Oh?					DATA			While I am quite proficient			Technically, according to my			fellow performers, I lack soul.					BEVERLY			Data, telling us why you're going			to fail before you make the			attempt is never wise.					DATA			But is not honesty always the			preferred choice?   STAR TREK: "Ensigns of Command" - REV. 7/14/89 - TEASER   2.2    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Excessive honesty can be			disastrous... particularly in a			commander.					DATA				(very intrigued)			Indeed?					PICARD			Knowing your limitations is one			thing. Advertising them to a crew			can damage your ability to lead.					DATA			Because you lose their respect?					BEVERLY			No, because you may begin to			believe in those limitations			yourself.	Data considers this, then moves to take his place with	the other performers.2A   ANGLE ON PICARD AND BEVERLY	O.s., the string quartet TUNES. There is the SOUND of	the communicator hail.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Captain, we're receiving a message			from the Sheliak Corporate.	Picard reacts with surprise, stands and EXITS.

English on one	side, Sheliak on the other. Sheliak is not symbols	as we know them, but rather a pattern of lights. A	recorded message begins.					SHELIAK VOICE			Federation creatures, there are			humans on the fifth planet of Tau			Cygna. This planet was ceded			to the corporate in section one			hundred and thirty-three,			paragraph seventy-seven of the			Treaty of Armens. We will begin			settlement of this world in four			days.

Supernumerary	at CONN.					WORF			Human life form readings from the			planet.					RIKER			So, the Sheliak weren't			hallucinating.					PICARD			Numbers?					WORF			Impossible to get an accurate			reading, Captain. The high			radiation levels are disrupting			our sensors.					DATA			Hyperonic radiation also			interferes with ship's			transporters; they are now			inoperable.					WORF			So are the ship's phasers.					RIKER			How can humans survive down there?					BEVERLY			They must have found a way to			adapt.				(thinks it over)			Milan's work in radiation			sensitivity suggests it's			possible.

They'd have no			compunctions about exterminating			the intruders.	Beverly is taken aback. Riker's dead serious.					PICARD			Mister Data. As you are unaffected			by hyperonic radiation, you will			go to the planet via shuttlecraft			and commence evacuation			procedures.					DATA			Aye, sir.	Without a word wasted the android is out of his chair,	and EXITS the bridge.					PICARD			Any speculation as to what he'll			find, Number One?					RIKER			A lost survey ship would be my			guess.

A thin white line descends	from the mountains, and as it comes closer we realize	it is an aqueduct. Along the line of the aqueduct are	lush fields, a veritable Garden of Eden, which ends	like a knife-cut and the desert returns. It culminates	in a strange cubistic-shaped purifying station. In a	pool, the water churns into a white froth.	GOSHEVEN, the leader, supervises TWO WORKERS testing	the water in the pool.	Data, Haritath, and Kentor approach.					HARITATH			Gosheven, look what's come --	Gosheven sees Data, looks him up and down very	carefully. Gosheven's as surprised as Haritath was,	but keeps a lid on it -- Data may represent a threat,	so Gosheven's attempting a poker face.					DATA			Lieutenant Commander Data of the			Starship Enterprise.   STAR TREK: "Ensigns of Command" REV. 7/20/89 - ACT ONE   10.11   CONTINUED:					KENTOR			He's an android.					GOSHEVEN			So he is.				(a beat)			Well, you're here -- what do you			want?					DATA			My mission is to prepare this			colony for evacuation.	Reactions from the men. Gosheven is calm, almost	amused:					GOSHEVEN			Why?					DATA			Because this planet belongs to			the Sheliak.					GOSHEVEN			And just who is this Sheliak?					DATA			The term is plural. The Sheliak			are an intelligent, non-humanoid			life form, classification R-3 --					GOSHEVEN				(interrupting)			This colony's been here for a			hundred and forty years -- and			no one's ever seen a Sheliak.			I'd say that makes Tau Cygna			Five our planet. (ALTERNATE:			ninety years)					DATA			But the original destination of			the Artemis was Septimis Minor.					GOSHEVEN			The guidance systems on the			Artemis failed -- and sent them			off course. Far off course.			Our ancestors were lucky to find			any place to land.   STAR TREK: "Ensigns of Command" REV. 7/24/89 - ACT ONE   11.11   CONTINUED: (2)					HARITATH			And when they did, the radiation			started killing them.					GOSHEVEN			Hyperonic radiation took the lives			of a third of the colonists before			they learned they could adapt			to it.					KENTOR			But the colony survived -- and			prospered.					GOSHEVEN				(with pride)			Look around. We've brought			water to the desert, built a			community.					DATA			Your accomplishments are indeed			remarkable. However, the			Sheliak and the Federation			have a treaty that clearly makes			this planet Sheliak domain.					GOSHEVEN			Then change the treaty.					DATA			That may not be possible. The			Sheliak wish to colonize this			planet, and they are unwilling			to share it with humans.					(MORE)   STAR TREK: "Ensigns of Command" REV. 7/24/89 - ACT ONE   12.11   CONTINUED: (3)					DATA (cont'd)			If you are still here when the			Sheliak colony ship arrives,			they will eradicate you.	Haritath and Kentor exchange a worried glance, but	Gosheven is unfazed.					HARITATH			They would kill us all?					DATA			They have little regard for			human life. Thus, our most			sensible course is to prepare a			contingency plan for the			evacuation of your people.					GOSHEVEN			We're not evacuating.	Data is taken aback. STAR TREK: "Ensigns of Command" - REV. 7/18/79 - ACT ONE 12A.11   CONTINUED: (4)					DATA			Perhaps I have not made myself			clear.					GOSHEVEN			Yes, you have.
