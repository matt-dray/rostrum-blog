Unfortunately, we			suspect that he may have been			involved not only in a security			breach but in the possible			sabotage of our warp drive.2    OMITTED3    INT. INTERROGATION ROOM	as seen in "The Defector." RIKER and TROI are	questioning; WORF stands by the door. In the hot seat	is a young Klingon civilian, J'DAN. He is wearing a	Starfleet communicator.					RIKER			What were you doing accessing			the propulsion system files on			Stardate 44758?					J'DAN			I didn't...      STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - TEASER      2.3    CONTINUED:					RIKER			But you did... from computer			Twelve-B-Nine on Deck Thirty-six.	A short beat as J'Dan looks surprised.					RIKER			The computer logged in your			identification from your			communicator.					J'DAN			It must be a mistake.					TROI			J'Dan... we have confirmed			reports that schematic drawings			of our dilithium chamber fell			into Romulan hands... one week			later.					J'DAN			I know nothing about it.					RIKER			And you don't know anything about			the explosion that disabled the			warp drive at almost the same			time?					J'DAN			No. I was not involved. You			accuse me because I am Klingon.	Troi shakes her head...					TROI			Our Chief Security Officer is			Klingon, J'Dan -- that has			nothing to do with it.					J'DAN			Send me home, then, if you are			so distrusting.					RIKER			We've discussed that with the			Klingon High Council. You'll be			sent back... as soon as we've			finished our investigation.     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/12/91 - TEASER     2A.3    CONTINUED: (2)					J'DAN			I have nothing more to say.					RIKER			Very well. Mister Worf... please			accompany the Lieutenant to his			quarters.	Worf comes forward and J'Dan rises. They EXIT. Riker	turns to Troi.					RIKER			What do you think?      STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/12/91 - TEASER      3.3    CONTINUED: (3)					TROI			It's hard to tell. He is very			closed... but...	Troi is silent for a moment, tapping into her feelings.					TROI			He is hiding something.4    INT. TURBOLIFT	Worf and J'Dan ride in silence for a bit. J'Dan	keeps sneaking looks at Worf, who stares straight	ahead.					J'DAN			On the Klingon Home World... your			name is not mentioned... it is			as though you never existed.	Worf shifts a little, impatiently, but makes no reply.					J'DAN			A terrible burden for a warrior			to bear... to become nothing...			without honor... without the			chance for glory...	The turbolift stops and the doors open. Worf exits	and turns to glare at J'Dan until he follows.5    INT. CORRIDOR	The two proceed down a corridor.					J'DAN			I have friends... powerful			friends... on the Home World.	No answer.					J'DAN			I could talk to them... they might			help to restore your name...	Silence.      STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - TEASER      4.5    CONTINUED:					J'DAN			If you could just take me to a			shuttlecraft...	They have reached J'Dan's quarters. The doors open,	Worf gestures to J'Dan to precede him. There is a	hesitation, then they ENTER.6    INT. J'DAN'S QUARTERS					J'DAN			It could be done without any one			knowing --	But suddenly, Worf has pulled some swift Klingon	martial arts move and J'Dan is thrown back against	the wall, with Worf pinning him solidly, nose-to-nose.					WORF			I do not know how you managed to			transfer secret information to the			Romulans... but I will find out.					J'DAN			Pahtak -- !					WORF			And when we inform the Klingon			High Council, they will put you to			a slow death.	He holds J'Dan against the wall for a fierce instant,	then releases him and EXITS.7    CLOSE ON J'DAN	as he follows Worf's exit with a vitriolic look.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE     5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:8    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND SMALLER SHIP (OPTICAL)	A Federation craft hovers near the Enterprise.					PICARD (V.O.)			Retired Admiral Norah Satie,			whose investigation exposed the			alien conspiracy against Starfleet			Command three years ago, is			arriving to assist in our			investigation.9    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)	PICARD and Riker watch as a group MATERIALIZES on the	pad: SABIN GENESTRA, a Betazoid man; NELLEN TORE, a	female assistant, and ADMIRAL NORAH SATIE, retired.	She surveys the waiting group before her, finds Picard,	and smiles radiantly. Norah Satie is middle-aged, a	beautiful woman who has become more so with maturity.	She is gracious, elegant, and decidedly feminine. Her	smile is generous, bespeaking warmth and intelligence.	She moves toward Picard, hand extended.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Captain Picard...	He takes her hand. The instinct is to kiss it -- she	evinces that kind of courtly behavior. But of course	that isn't Starfleet regulation, so Picard gives it a	proper grasp.					PICARD			Admiral Satie. Welcome to the			Enterprise.					ADMIRAL SATIE			I am delighted to be here.				(gesturing)			I've managed to acquire my former			staff... My aide, Sabin Genestra,			from Betazed, and my assistant,			Nellen Tore, from Delb Two.     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/12/91 - ACT ONE     6.9    CONTINUED:					PICARD			And my First Officer, Commander			William Riker. May I show you			to your quarters?					ADMIRAL SATIE			Captain... if Starfleet Command			is so concerned with your report			that they brought me out of			retirement... I think I should			get right to work.					PICARD			Very well... Commander, will you			see to the Admiral's Staff?	Riker turns to the others as --					ADMIRAL SATIE			First, I'd like to inspect the			damage to your Engine Room.	And she heads for the door with Picard close at her	heels.	10	INT. ENGINEERING - A LITTLE LATER	DATA and GEORDI oversee a scene which finds the section	isolation door between the dilithium chamber and the	pool table area closed. Behind the door there are	clouds of gas, and the hatch of the chamber has been	blown off.					GEORDI			We still can't get in there,			Captain. The radiation levels			are dropping, but they're too high			to raise the isolation door.					PICARD			How much longer will it be?					DATA			At the rate the levels have been			decreasing, we will be able to			gain entry in forty-nine hours.     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE     7.10   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Maybe the Admiral would like to			see the visual log of the			explosion.	Satie acknowledges. They move to a wall monitor and	Geordi punches in commands.					GEORDI			This was logged four days ago...			at oh-three hundred hours.11   ANGLE - MONITOR (OPTICAL) - INTERCUTTING	It is a video of the dilithium chamber... maybe a time	code in the corner... MOS... they wait... wait... and	then suddenly, the hatch to the chamber blows off and	across the room.					GEORDI			At that point the emergency			confinement field was activated			and the isolation doors came			down. No one was killed, but			two of my people are in Sickbay			with radiation burns.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Have you been able to make any			preliminary assessments?					DATA			A slow-motion study of the			explosion suggests that the			articulation frame collapsed.					ADMIRAL SATIE			The schematics that were stolen			from the Enterprise... I believe			some involved the articulation			frame of the dilithium chamber...     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/12/91 - ACT ONE     7A.11   CONTINUED:					PICARD				(acknowledging)			That is one reason we tend to			suspect sabotage.					DATA			Other evidence lends credence to			that theory, Captain. A review			of the sensor logs indicates that			every systems reading was well			within normal parameters until			fifty-two milliseconds before the			explosion.					GEORDI			We haven't found anything that			suggests there was a malfunction			anywhere along the line.     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/12/91 - ACT ONE     8.11   CONTINUED: (2)	Satie turns toward Picard.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Captain Picard... I think I need			a full briefing before we go any			further.	She looks through the isolation door at the grim	evidence of destruction.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Commander Data... La Forge... I'll			admit I'm glad I don't have to			do your job... good luck.12   INT. SICKBAY	Worf ENTERS and approaches BEVERLY, who is examining	a patient on a bio-bed. He is swathed in wraps which	suggest burns. In the background is SIMON TARSES, a	mild-looking humanoid working at a monitor.					WORF			Excuse me, Doctor...					BEVERLY			Yes, Lieutenant?					WORF			When you have a moment... I must			ask you something...	She turns to him.					BEVERLY			Good timing. I'm finished here...			Mister Tarses... ?     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE     9.12   CONTINUED:	Tarses approaches from the monitor.					BEVERLY			Please enter these readings into			Ensign Dagget's file.					TARSES			Yes, Doctor.	He takes the tricorder and Beverly and Worf move off	together.					BEVERLY			What is it, Worf?	He shows her an object.					WORF			Did you issue this to J'Dan?	Beverly takes the object, inspects it...					BEVERLY			Looks like a micro-replicating			hyposyringe... but it's not			Starfleet issue...					WORF			It was found... in his quarters.					BEVERLY			J'Dan has Ba'ltmasor Syndrome...			he comes in regularly for			treatments... but we use our			own hyposprays. Is this one			Klingon?					WORF			Yes. Do you know what this			attachment is?13   INSERT - HYPOSYRINGE	Worf indicates a small connection on the syringe.     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE     10.14   BACK TO SCENE					BEVERLY			No... it's nothing we use...	Worf seems satisfied with that answer.					WORF			Thank you, Doctor.					BEVERLY				(a bit puzzled)			I hope that helps.					WORF			You've told me exactly what I			wanted to hear.	And he EXITS, as Beverly looks after him, perplexed.15   INT. READY ROOM	Picard and Satie. The briefing has been continuing for	some time.					PICARD			There are disturbing overtones...			to the idea of a Klingon providing			information to the Romulans...	She keeps her eyes on Picard, revealing nothing.					PICARD			Are you... aware... of any other			Romulan-Klingon connections that			Starfleet Command might have			encountered recently?     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE     11.15   CONTINUED:					ADMIRAL SATIE				(gently)			I don't believe... what Starfleet			Command knows or doesn't know is			for me to reveal.					PICARD			This ship has had several			encounters which might suggest			a potential alliance between those			two powers --					ADMIRAL SATIE			We're aware of that, Captain.			What we must concentrate on is			the business at hand.	The door CHIMES.					PICARD			Come.	The doors open and Worf ENTERS, sees the Admiral,	stops.					WORF			Excuse me, Captain, I didn't know			--					PICARD			Please come in Mister Worf. I			particularly want our guest to			meet you... Admiral Satie...			my head of security, Lieutenant			Worf.	Nods of acknowledgment.					WORF			Captain... I have been pursuing			the investigation of Lieutenant			J'Dan. I believe I know how			he transferred information off			the Enterprise.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Good work, Lieutenant.     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE     12.15   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF				(producing the syringe)			This is J'Dan's. It is fitted			with an optical reader...			specially modified to read data			from Starfleet isolinear chips.	Satie takes the syringe and inspects it.					WORF			He can extract digital information			from a computer... encode it in			the form of amino-acid sequences,			and transfer those sequences into			a fluid in the syringe... Then			he injects someone, perhaps even			without their knowledge...					ADMIRAL SATIE				(suggesting a				 conspiracy)			Or perhaps with their knowledge...					WORF			The information would be carried			in their bloodstream in the form			of inert proteins.					ADMIRAL SATIE				(shakes her head with				 realization)			The body itself becomes a conveyor			of top-secret files...	She turns toward Worf, obviously impressed.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Lieutenant Worf... when we			confront J'Dan, I want you to			conduct the interrogation.					WORF			I would be honored.	Worf nods to the two and EXITS. Satie turns to Picard.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Captain... I predict that officer			will be extremely valuable in this			investigation.	Picard has no reason to doubt it.      STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE 13-15.        16   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SEVERAL DAYS LATER	Arranged to accommodate more questioners: Satie and	Sabin, Picard and Worf. Off to one side sits Nellen,	constantly taking notes. J'Dan is once again in the	hot seat as Worf stands over him; they look like	they've been at it a while.					WORF			I tracked the movements of each			person who left the Enterprise			since you've been here. I traced			one Tarkanian diplomat as far as			the Cruces system... where he			disappeared and has not been seen			since.					J'DAN			That proves nothing.	Worf produces the syringe; J'Dan eyes it warily.					WORF			This was found in your quarters.					J'DAN			I take injections. Everyone knows			that.					WORF			But your injections don't require			an optical chip reader. This			device --				(points to it)			-- has only one function: to			transform computer information			into biological sequences.	Worf has nailed him. J'Dan knows it now. No reason	to hold back now... he speaks with the fervor of a	patriot:					J'DAN			The blood of all Klingons has			become water... since the			Federation alliance we have			become a nation of mewling			babies... The Romulans are			strong... they are worthy			allies... they do not turn			Klingons into weaklings --				(turns to Worf)			-- like you...     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT ONE     16.16   CONTINUED:	Satie rises, crosses to J'Dan.					ADMIRAL SATIE			How did you damage the dilithium			chamber?					J'DAN			I had nothing to do with that --					ADMIRAL SATIE			No? You mean it was sheer			coincidence that it was sabotaged			after you gave the plans for its			design to the Romulans?					J'DAN			I do not know. I had nothing to			do with it.					ADMIRAL SATIE			You've admitted your crime. Why			lie now?					J'DAN			I am not lying.	She regards him calmly for a moment, then nods,	finished, to Picard.					PICARD			You may have him confined, Mister			Worf.	Only too happy to do so, Worf leads J'Dan from the	room. Satie approaches Sabin.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Sabin?					SABIN			I believe... he is telling the			truth.	A moment while they absorb this.     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/12/91 - ACT ONE     17.16   CONTINUED: (2)					SABIN			He admits stealing the files...			but not sabotaging the dilithium			chamber. I get no sense that he			is lying.	Picard considers the ramifications of this statement.					PICARD			If you're right... someone else			may be involved.					ADMIRAL SATIE			I think, Captain... that you have			a bigger problem on your ship than			one Klingon Exchange Officer.	And as Picard considers the dire implications of that	possibility --									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                               STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT TWO     18.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:17   INT.

They have finished an informal	supper; she rises and brings a tray of coffee things;	during the next, she pours for them and twists a rind	of lemon into her own. She looks lovely tonight...	fragile and delicate, like a piece of porcelain. She	is a woman who has the capacity to be both forceful	and vulnerable.					ADMIRAL SATIE			I've seen this before. The			spectre of conspiracy on a			starship is a frightening one.					PICARD			It's hard for me to believe...			but I am grateful for your			presence, Admiral. If anyone in			Starfleet can help us, it's you.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Captain Picard... I find myself			changing my mind about you...					PICARD			In what way... ?					ADMIRAL SATIE			When Starfleet ordered me here...			it was with the express command			that we work together on this			problem... as equals...				(beat)			My father taught me to avoid			partnerships... most of them are			woefully lop-sided.     STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/7/91 - ACT TWO     19.17   CONTINUED:					PICARD			That sounds like Judge Aaron			Satie...					ADMIRAL SATIE			You knew my father?					PICARD			Through his writing. His judicial			decisions were required reading			at the Academy.					ADMIRAL SATIE			He was an extraordinary man.			Every night at the dinner table...			he'd pose a question for debate.			My big brothers and I would			wrangle it around, from one side			and the other... my father would			referee... he kept a stopwatch			on us so we'd have to learn			brevity... and he wouldn't let			us leave until he thought we had			completely explored the issue...					PICARD			I'm willing to wager you trounced			your brothers in those debates...	She laughs delightedly.					ADMIRAL SATIE			More than once.

Unaccustomed tears threaten to sting	her eyes, and she rises quickly, clearing the dishes,	changing the subject.					ADMIRAL SATIE			I like your Mister Worf. Very			direct, to the point. The two			of you make a good combination.	Having regained composure, she slips back into her	seat, looks him in the eye.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Captain... I've always preferred			working alone.				(smiles)			That way, if something goes wrong,			I don't have to look far for the			cause.				(beat)			I resented your being assigned			to me. But...

Just because there			was no sabotage doesn't mean			there's not a conspiracy on this			ship. We do have a confessed spy.					SABIN			And he had confederates.					PICARD			Do we know that for sure?					ADMIRAL SATIE			Of course he did.	She moves closer to Picard.    STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/13/91 - ACT THREE    33.23   CONTINUED:					ADMIRAL SATIE			Do you think J'Dan could have			come on board the flagship of the			Federation and done all that he			did without help?					PICARD			It would be difficult... but not			impossible...					WORF			We must continue to investigate			Tarses.

INTERROGATION ROOM	Now, there are more people in the gallery, including a	greying Starfleet Admiral. At the head table are only	Satie and Sabin. Worf is in the audience. And, in	the hot seat -- Picard.					SABIN			Your full name?					PICARD			Jean-Luc Picard.					SABIN			Rank and position?					PICARD			Captain, Federation Starship			Enterprise.					SABIN			How long have you held that post?					PICARD			Over three years.

His manner	is soothing... clearly he's trying to calm things down,	not inflame them.					PICARD			I am deeply concerned by what is			happening here. It began when			we apprehended a spy, a man who			admitted his guilt and who will			answer for his crime. But the			hunt didn't stop there. Another			man, Simon Tarses, was brought			to trial -- and it was a trial,			no matter what others may call			it.	He pauses, picking his way carefully through this mine	field.					PICARD			Unfortunately, it was a trial			based on insinuation and innuendo.			Nothing substantive against			Crewman Tarses was offered, much			less proven.	He walks toward Tarses, who sits in the audience.					PICARD			This man has a Romulan			grandfather. For that, his career			stands in ruins. Have we become			so fearful? Have we become so			cowardly that we must extinguish			a man because he carries the blood			of a current enemy?	He paces back and forth in front of the table.					PICARD			I remind you... we are not			descended from cowardly people.			We come from those who were			willing to think the unthinkable,			speak the unspeakable...					(MORE)         STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT FIVE        52.31   CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD (Cont'd)			... and to defend with passion			ideas and causes which were, at			the moment, unpopular.	He moves toward Satie, a final, urgent plea.					PICARD			Admiral, let us not condemn Simon			Tarses or anyone else on the basis			of half-truth. I implore you...			do not continue with this			proceeding. End it here.	He returns to his seat. The Starfleet Admiral waits	with a grim, thoughtful look on his face. Sabin turns	to Norah, who is looking down, fiddling with a Padd,	making little notations, seemingly unaffected by	Picard's words.					ADMIRAL SATIE				(beat; still looking				 down, soft and calm)			Captain Picard... do you believe			in the Prime Directive?					PICARD			Of course.					ADMIRAL SATIE			In fact, it is Starfleet General			Order Number One, isn't it?					PICARD			Your point, Admiral... ?					ADMIRAL SATIE				(now she looks at him)			Would it surprise you to learn			that you have violated the Prime			Directive a total of nine times			since you took command of the			Enterprise?				(without allowing him				 to answer)			I must say, Captain, it surprised			the hell out of me.					PICARD			My reports to Starfleet document			the circumstances in each of those			instances --         STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT FIVE        53.31   CONTINUED: (3)					ADMIRAL SATIE			Yes, we're looking into those			reports, Captain, very closely			into those reports... after which			I'm sure we'll have more questions			for you about your so-called			commitment to Starfleet's Prime			Directive.	She glances at the Starfleet Admiral for approval...	she doesn't get it. He's waiting to see where this	goes. He looks at her evenly as...					SABIN			Captain, could you explain just			what happened on Stardate 44390?					PICARD			Excuse me?					SABIN			Let me refresh your memory. You			were transporting a Vulcan			ambassador... T'Pel...					PICARD			I was following orders to deliver			the ambassador to a destination			near the Neutral Zone, and --					ADMIRAL SATIE			I don't think we need the			preamble.					SABIN			In fact, she was not a Vulcan at			all, was she? She was a Romulan			spy.					PICARD			That's correct.					SABIN			A spy whom you delivered back			into the hands of the enemy.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Tell me, Captain... when the			deception was revealed... and she			stood proudly on the Bridge of			a Romulan ship... did you make			any effort to retrieve her?         STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT FIVE        54.31   CONTINUED: (4)					PICARD			No.					ADMIRAL SATIE			No? Even though you knew she			carried Federation secrets she			had been accumulating for years?					PICARD			There was no chance of getting			her back. We were deep in Romulan			space. The safety of my crew was			my primary concern.					WORF				(rises to defend Picard)			The Enterprise could have been			captured by Romulans... Captain			Picard did the only thing he could.	Satie turns to him, stunned and furious at his	perfidy.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Really, Lieutenant? And where			were you while this traitor was			on board the Enterprise? Where			was ship's security?					SABIN			Wouldn't you say it is			questionable judgment, Captain,			to have a security officer whose			father was a Romulan			collaborator?	Worf rises... begins to move toward the podium.					PICARD			Lieutenant?	Worf stops, sits. Satie continues to glance at the	Starfleet Admiral who looks increasingly uncomfortable	and unconvinced by Satie's argument. She moves to	her biggest gun...					ADMIRAL SATIE			Captain Picard... have you fully			recovered from your experience			with the Borg?         STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/25/91 - ACT FIVE        55.31   CONTINUED: (5)	Picard's eyes go cold.					PICARD			Yes. I am fully recovered.					ADMIRAL SATIE			It must have been awful...			actually becoming one of them...			being forced to use your vast			knowledge of Starfleet operations			to aid the Borg...	Picard has assumed a tight masque. Satie, carrying	her Padd, moves in the general direction of the	visiting Starfleet Admiral, playing to him but not	being obvious about it.					ADMIRAL SATIE			Just how many of our ships were			destroyed?				(checks Padd)			...ah. I have it...			thirty-nine... with the loss of			life measured at nearly eleven			thousand...	She pauses to let this sink in. There is a stirring	among the audience. She looks toward the Admiral,	begins talking about Picard in the third person.					ADMIRAL SATIE			One wonders how this man can sleep			at night... having caused so much			destruction...32   CLOSE ON THE STARFLEET ADMIRAL	He looks hard at Satie... uncomfortable... losing	patience with this...         STAR TREK: "The Drumhead" - REV. 2/15/91 - ACT FIVE        56.33   RESUME	As Satie strikes back at Picard.					ADMIRAL SATIE			I question your actions,			Captain... I question your			choices... I question your			loyalty...	She glares at the Admiral, who looks down at the floor.	He's finding this harder and harder to endure. There	is a small silence, and Picard's voice fills it,	speaking softly but in a tone that commands attention.					PICARD			There is a saying... which many			of us have heard since we were			school children... "With the first			link, the chain is forged. The			first speech censured, the first			thought forbidden, the first			freedom denied -- chains us all,			irrevocably."	Two bright spots have appeared on Norah Satie's cheeks.	Her eyes burn into Picard.					PICARD			Those words were uttered by Judge			Aaron Satie -- as wisdom and			warning. The very first time any			man's freedoms are trampled...			we are all damaged.				(beat)			I fear... that today... on this			starship... we are forging that			chain.33A  ON SATIE					ADMIRAL SATIE				(outraged)			How dare you -- you who consort			with Romulans... invoke my			father's name to support your			traitorous arguments...

She turns around, sees all eyes	on her. She now sees the Admiral's empty chair.	She casts one glance at Picard, who holds her gaze	coolly. She takes a breath, moves toward her table,	sits.					ADMIRAL SATIE				(with dignity)			I have nothing more to say.	Silence.					SABIN			Perhaps... we should take a			recess... until tomorrow.	People begin rising and moving out of the room. In the	midst of it all, Norah Satie sits like a prim	sculpture, hands folded neatly on the table, back	erect, eyes focused right in front of her. The room is	a mass of movement and confusion, in the midst of which	she is a rock in the stream, eddies swirling around	her as she sits in perfect stillness at her table.33B  OMITTED34   EXT.
