Picard APPROACHES	ARMUS.					PICARD			I want to see my people on the			shuttle.	ARMUS doesn't answer. ARMUS makes a very slight	motion and Picard DISAPPEARS.

VAGRA - NEAR ARMUS (OPTICAL)	The captain MATERIALIZES and faces ARMUS.					PICARD			How long have you been on this			planet?					ARMUS			Since they left.					PICARD			Someone was here before?					ARMUS			Long ago.					PICARD			They abandoned you. Who were			they?					ARMUS			A race of titans. So they			thought. Together, they perfected			a method of bringing to the			surface all that was evil and			negative within them. All this			erupted on the outside, spread,			and connected. In time, it formed			a second skin, dank and vile.			They found a way to rid themselves			of it, leaving them free of the			bonds of destructiveness. Then			they left. And here I am.        STAR TREK: "The Shroud" - 2/1/88 - ACT FIVE        46.64   CONTINUED:					PICARD			It must be very lonely.					ARMUS			You cannot trick me by pretending			compassion, captain.					PICARD			Haven't you seen we humans are			capable of compassion?					ARMUS			Oh, yes. It is revolting. Time			and again you rise from despair			into hope. From hate into			understanding. From aloneness			into love. But you are puny.			Weak. Vessels that die from a			flick of my power.					PICARD			But our spirit soars. A great			poet once said "all spirits are			enslaved which serve things evil."					ARMUS			Picard, it is impossible for you			to accept that I am truly evil.					PICARD			Because you are not.					ARMUS			I am a skin of evil.					PICARD			Nothing in the universe is the			same as anything else -- but			everything has light and dark.	ARMUS is SILENT.					PICARD				(continuing)			They did not leave you because			they hated you.

The bridge crew FILES IN, one by one.	Beverly ENTERS first. Troi is pale, and weak, but	recovering. She leans on Riker, whose face still shows	some effects of the shroud. Geordi and Worf COME IN,	followed by Data. Wesley is leading them to their	assigned seats.        STAR TREK: "The Shroud" - 2/1/88 - ACT FIVE        48.68   CONTINUED:					WESLEY				(to Data)			This is where you're supposed to			sit.					DATA			Why?					WESLEY			I don't know. The captain gave			me a seating plan.	He sits down next to his mother, who smiles at him and	puts her arm around him. He moves in closer to her,	needing her comfort. Picard goes to the front.	Everything is quiet.					PICARD			We are here together to honor our			friend and comrade Lieutenant			Natasha Yar. We will have much			time to grieve for her in the days			ahead, but for now, she has asked			that we celebrate her life -- with			her. She has left a living will.	He moves to sit in his assigned seat in the middle of	the front row. The LIGHTS DIM. And as a HOLOGRAPHIC	IMAGE OF TASHA APPEARS in front of the group, there are	gasps of surprise -- each of the bridge crew REACTS to	the Image in front of them.					TASHA			Welcome, my friends. You are here			now watching this image of me			because I have died. It probably			happened while I was on duty, and			quickly, which is what I expected,			and what I wanted. Never forget			I died doing exactly what I chose			to do.	As Tasha speaks, she looks out at the gathering as if	she's really a part of it.					TASHA				(continuing)			What I want you to know is how			much I loved my life... and each			of you who shared it with me.			You are my "family."					(MORE)        STAR TREK: "The Shroud" - 2/1/88 - ACT FIVE        49.68   CONTINUED: (2)					TASHA (Cont'd)			Whoever I was before Starfleet,			where I came from, isn't			important. I have been blessed			with your friendship and your			love.	She looks directly at Riker.					TASHA				(continuing)			Will Riker, you are the best.			From the moment you beamed on			board, you never failed me. You			trusted me, you encouraged me			and most of all, you made me			laugh.	She smiles right at him and he can't help but smile	back. Troi holds his hand tightly.					TASHA				(continuing; looking				 at Troi)			Deanna... you are capable of so			much love, you taught me without			ever having to say a word. I			realized I could be feminine			without losing anything --			something I never thought I could			achieve.	Troi wipes a tear from her cheek.					TASHA				(continuing; looking				 at Worf)			Ah, Worf. I hope for your sake			I met death with my eyes open.			We are so much alike, you and			I, both warriors, orphans who			found ourselves this family.	Worf stares at her image, unbelieving and pained.					TASHA				(continuing; to Beverly)			My friend, Beverly. True to			yourself, your ideals. Your			fierce devotion comes from within.			It can't be diminished. From			you I have learned to strive for			excellence, no matter what the			personal cost.             STAR TREK: "The Shroud" - 2/1/88 - ACT FIVE            50.68   CONTINUED: (3)	Beverly and Wesley hold tight to each other.					TASHA				(continuing; to Wesley)			Wesley, I'm sorry that I won't			be able to see you grow into the			exceptional man you'll be. But			I have my vision of who you are			and your kindness and innocence			is ageless.	The Tasha hologram turns to face Geordi. Who knows how	he sees her in this half-state?					TASHA				(continuing)			Geordi, in those moments I felt			the most despair, you took my hand			and made everything better. Your			innate joy taught me to look			beyond the moment.	Geordi looks down -- he can't bear to see/not see her.					TASHA				(continuing)			Mister Data. Android...			automaton... robot.				(shakes her head)			No. You see things with the			wonder of a child, and that makes			you more human than any of us.			I love you just the way you are.	The Tasha image turns to Picard.					TASHA				(continuing)			Captain Jean-Luc Picard. I can't			say you've been like a father to			me, because I never had one and			I don't know what it feels like.			But if I could choose someone in			this universe to be like, someone			who I would want to make proud			of me, it's you. You who have			the heart of an explorer and the			soul of a poet. So you will			understand when I say "Death is			that state in which one exists			only in the memory of others...			which is why it is not an end."					(MORE)             STAR TREK: "The Shroud" - 2/1/88 - ACT FIVE            51.68   CONTINUED: (4)					TASHA (Cont'd)				(beat)			No good-byes. Just "au revoir,"			my friends.	Picard waits a moment, and as Tasha's IMAGE FADES:					PICARD			Au revoir, Natasha.	He gets up before the group.					PICARD				(continuing)			The service is concluded.	As everyone FILES OUT, Data gets up and WALKS OVER to	where the Tasha image was standing. He looks puzzled.	Picard WALKS OVER to him.					DATA			Sir, the purpose of this gathering			has eluded me.					PICARD			Oh? How so?					DATA			My thoughts are not for Tasha,			but for myself. I keep thinking			how empty it will feel without			her presence. I missed the point.					PICARD			No, you didn't, Data.
