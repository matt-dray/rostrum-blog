WORF'S QUARTERS	where CANDLES and other Klingon ARTIFACTS are arranged	around the DIMLY LIT room. WORF, dressed in Klingon	CEREMONIAL ROBES, paces back and forth, talking to	himself -- he's practicing a speech.					WORF			-- as time passes, a boy			inevitably becomes a man.

I didn't mean to hit you.         STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - 01/28/94 - TEASER         2.1    CONTINUED:	Worf looks down at his chest, then up at the boy, who	decides not to wait around to see how this big Klingon	is going to react to his mistake -- he turns and	scampers off down the hall.	Worf turns toward Alexander, who's frozen in place,	waiting to see how his dad is going to take what	happened.					WORF			What is the meaning of this?					ALEXANDER			I'm sorry. We made Fullerenes in			chemistry class and filled them			with water --	Worf interrupts; he has more important things on his	mind.					WORF			I asked you to meet me here after			school. I have been waiting for			you.	Alexander realizes --					ALEXANDER			I forgot.					WORF			You forgot because you allowed			yourself to be distracted by			foolishness.					ALEXANDER			I'm sorry.					WORF			There is something important I			want to discuss with you.	He gestures that Alexander take a seat. Alexander	looks around; his father is obviously up to something	that has to do with Klington culture and the boy is a	little wary.	Worf launches into his speech -- even though he	practiced it, there's an edge of nervousness in his	voice.       STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - TEASER       3.1    CONTINUED: (2)					WORF				(continuing)			As time passes, a boy inevitably			becomes a man.

It is			very challenging, but I will help			you prepare.	Worf takes a thick CANDLE and hands it to Alexander,	then takes a second candle for himself.       STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - TEASER       4.1    CONTINUED: (3)					WORF				(continuing)			This is a kor'tova candle... it			represents the fire that burns in			a warrior's heart.	Worf lights his from a large burning candle on the	table.					WORF				(continuing)			When you light yours, you will be			declaring your intention to become			a warrior.	Alexander holds his candle, uncertain.					WORF				(continuing)			Go ahead.					ALEXANDER			What if... I don't want to?					WORF			If you do not participate in the			rite before you are thirteen years			of age, you will never be able to			become a true Klingon warrior.					ALEXANDER			I don't care about that...					WORF			You may not care now, but someday			you might.					ALEXANDER			Mother always said that I didn't			have to do any of this Klingon			stuff if I didn't want to.					WORF			It is your decision... but --					ALEXANDER			Good, then I'm not going to do it.	Alexander puts the candle down and starts to stand.					WORF			Alexander --       STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - TEASER       5.1    CONTINUED: (4)					ALEXANDER			You just said it was up to me.			And I don't want to be a warrior.	And with that he turns and EXITS to his room... the	door shuts behind him.

OBSERVATION LOUNGE	where PICARD, RIKER, DATA and Worf are concluding a	mission briefing. Worf seems distracted, his mind	elsewhere.					PICARD			As a result, the Kearsarge won't			be able to rendezvous with us for			another four days.					RIKER			Will we be holding position here			until it arrives?					PICARD			Yes. And, as it looks as though			we'll have a few days of relative			quiet, I'm going to take advantage			of the time by visiting the			Hatarian System. There are			ancient ruins there just being			excavated.					DATA			The delay will also make it			possible for Stellar Dynamics to			complete their study of the Vodrey			Nebula.					RIKER			I'll let them know they can have			more access to the lateral sensor			grid.					PICARD				(to Worf)			This might be a good time to			recalibrate the weapon targeting			array.	Worf doesn't seem to have heard him.					PICARD				(continuing)			Mister Worf?	Worf snaps out of it, focuses.      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT ONE      6A.2    CONTINUED:					WORF			Yes, sir.

I'm sure they'll			celebrate the festival there.					WORF			Yes... but the outpost is on the			far side of the Vodrey Nebula, it			is three days away by shuttle...					PICARD			The Enterprise could be there in			a fraction of that time, and still			be back here for our rendezvous.	Worf is grateful, but doesn't feel right about	detouring the entire ship.					WORF			Sir, I could not ask you to --					PICARD			I'm willing to bet Stellar			Dynamics would like nothing better			than to make a trip around the			Nebula; it'll give them the chance			to study it that much more			thoroughly.	Worf looks at Picard, grateful...

KLINGON OUTPOST - DAY	where the festival of Kot'baval is in progress.	Although there are signs of modernity, the town square	has an ancient, almost medieval feel to it -- it has	heavy stone walls, and little storefronts where	colorful Klingon wares are sold.	A Klingon street opera is being performed in the town	square. TWO KLINGONS are singing and engaging in mockcombat,	accompanied by LIVE MUSICIANS who are making a	din only a Klingon could love. The two performers are	elaborately clad in colorful ROBES, and their BAT'LETH	SWORDS have little BELLS all around their frames that	jangle as they fight -- whenever one of them executes	a particularly good move he'll raise the sword above	his head and shake it vigorously, bellowing some	unintelligible Klingon lyric at the same time.	Enterprise crewmembers, including GEORDI and BEVERLY,	fill out the crowd of N.D. KLINGONS who crane their	heads to watch what is going on. Alexander stands next	to Worf, watching the spectacle with wide eyes.	A vendor passes nearby and Worf calls out to her.					WORF			Bok'ta ku'mo. (over here)	She approaches and Worf hands her a coin -- she gives	him a bag of live worms. Worf takes a sumptuous	handful, then hands the bag to Alexander, who's so busy	watching the opera that he takes a mouthful without	really looking at what it is. To Worf's surprise, he	likes it, and keeps chewing without comment...	Behind them, at the rear of the crowd, we REVEAL that a	KLINGON of about fifty is intently watching Worf and	Alexander. He's wearing battle gear, and his forehead	ridges are somewhat less pronounced than what we're	used to seeing.	As father and son watch, the larger of the two	performers fells the smaller one and sings out	triumphantly, rattling his BAT'LETH in victory.					GEORDI			Who's that?					WORF			That is the tyrant Molor. He was			so strong that no one could stand			against him.      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT ONE      10.4    CONTINUED:	The fallen singer cries out plaintively from the floor.					SINGER			Nok'tar be'got, hosh'ar te'not... ?	The musicians bang and whistle their instruments to	punctuate his words.					BEVERLY			What's he saying?					WORF			He is asking if anyone else will			have the courage to stand up to			Molor...	Worf and Alexander look around at the crowd, but no one	steps forward.					SINGER			Nok'tar be'got... ?	Suddenly Worf steps forward and grabs the fallen	singer's BAT'LETH. He sings out at a challenge to	"Molor" at the top of his lungs --					WORF			Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok!	"Molor" cries out when he sees Worf and springs toward	him to attack.					MOLOR				(a battle cry)			Ni'tokor bak'to!	And the two men start to fight -- the movements are not	choreographed, but they are controlled in that they are	based on the forms of the mok'bara. As they fight they	sing out and the crowd cheers them on.					MOLOR				(continuing)			Ba'jak tu'mo!	And their bat'leths clang together --					WORF				(defiant)			O'tak tu'ro!	Alexander watches rapt... behind him, we see the	strange Klingon, staring intently at Alexander...      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT ONE      11.4    CONTINUED: (2)	After a few more thrusts and parries, Worf plays his	part and pretends to be felled -- he sings out the same	plea as before, wondering who will save them from	Molor.					WORF				(continuing)			Nok'tar be'got?	Molor sings out triumphantly, turns to the crowd, who	boo and hiss the anti-hero. Worf gives Alexander an	encouraging look.					WORF				(continuing)			Hosh'ar te'not?	Alexander considers, then dashes forward and grabs the	BAT'LETH from the floor. He raises it defiantly toward	Molor.					ALEXANDER			Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok!	Molor turns, and a smile lights up his face when he	sees his young challenger.					MOLOR			What's this... ?	He steps toward Alexander, weapon raised, and is	careful to scale down his combat so as not to hurt the	boy. Worf watches, thrilled as can be.	Alexander, however, is pumped full of adrenaline -- he	takes a few wild swings that Molor has to dodge by	moving fast.	Then he allows Alexander to make contact with one of	the blows, and he falls back, feigning injury.					MOLOR			Jik'ta! You have wounded me!	Alexander looks pleased with himself. Worf beams with	pride.					WORF			You fought well.      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT ONE      12.4    CONTINUED: (3)	Alexander smiles, turns back to the opera.					ALEXANDER			What happens now?					WORF			Only one man can stand against			Molor.	The crowd cheers because the first singer steps back	into the square, now wearing a different head-dress	that indicates he is playing Kahless.					ALEXANDER			It's Kahless!	"Kahless" rears himself up and sings out defiantly --					SINGER			Nok'til Kahless. Molor gik'tal!        STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - 01/28/94 - ACT ONE        12A.	CONTINUED: (4)	The crowd roars their approval.					WORF			Kahless would rather die than live			under Molor's tyranny...	The two singers start to fight and sing, and the crowd	watches in rapt attention.      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT ONE      13.4    CONTINUED: (5)					ALEXANDER			Ni'lot Kahless!	Worf looks down at his son's wide-eyed face... things	couldn't be going better...									TIME CUT:5    EXT. KLINGON OUTPOST - NIGHT	The square is now deserted and dark. We pan across a	sleeping FIGURE stretched out on a bench, then find	Worf sitting nearby, waiting impatiently for Alexander.	After a moment, the boy comes running across the	square.					ALEXANDER			Father --					WORF			Where have you been?					ALEXANDER			We were watching the fire dancers.					WORF			We?					ALEXANDER			K'Nor and Bar'el -- they live here			on the outpost.

The attackers are	momentarily taken off-guard, and Worf seizes the moment --					WORF			Alexander, run --	He points Alexander on the safest route and the boy	scurries past the attackers and away...	A second attacker lunges toward Worf, who dodges his	weapon and delivers a kick to his mid-section... the	third attacker strikes Worf a vicious blow that sends	him to the floor.	K'mtar can't risk taking another shot -- everything's	happening too fast and he might hit Worf, so he rushes	forward intending to join in the fight.					K'MTAR				(a battle cry)			Ni'tokor bak'to!	The sound of K'mtar's cry distracts the third attacker	for the crucial second it takes Worf to recover... he	gets a leg up and flips him over his prone body -- the	attacker hits the floor hard and loses his grip on the	dagger, which goes skittering across the floor.	Because one of them has lost his weapon, and because an	armed stranger is coming to the rescue, the three	attackers beat a retreat.      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT TWO      17.8    CONTINUED:					K'MTAR			K'pla, Worf.

OBSERVATION LOUNGE	where Riker, Worf and K'mtar have met to discuss what	happened. The dagger dropped in the attack is on the	table, wrapped in a soft cloth. K'mtar seems a little	impatient, as if he wants Riker to leave him and Worf	alone.					WORF				(gesturing to K'mtar)			He is gin'tak to the house of			Mogh...					RIKER			Gin'tak?        STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - 01/28/94 - ACT TWO        17A.9    CONTINUED:					WORF			An advisor so trusted that he is			made part of a family.	Riker takes this in.      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT TWO      18.9    CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			Do you have any idea who was			behind the attack?	K'mtar's attitude toward Riker is blunt to the point of	being contentious.					K'MTAR			It is a Klingon matter. Not your			concern.	Riker is surprised at the sharpness of his tone, tries	to be diplomatic but firm.					RIKER			One of my officers was almost			killed. That makes it my concern.	K'mtar eyes Riker briefly, then backs off.					K'MTAR			Recently rumors began to circulate			on the homeworld that an			assassination attempt was going to			be made against the family of			Mogh. Kurn sent me to make sure			nothing happened to Worf.					RIKER			Why didn't you warn him before the			attack was made?					K'MTAR			I tried to contact him by			subspace, but was told Worf wasn't			aboard. I decided to beam			directly to the surface.      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO      19.9    CONTINUED: (3)	Worf unwraps the cloth and reveals the dagger.					WORF			One of the attackers dropped this			dagger.				(gestures)			The design... represents the house			of Duras.					K'MTAR			We have other evidence that			indicates the Duras sisters, Lursa			and B'Etor, were behind the			attack.					RIKER			What do you think they're after?					K'MTAR			Kurn's seat on the council, of			course.					WORF			We can not allow their attack on			our house to go unanswered.					K'MTAR			First we have to find them... and			they've been elusive.	Riker considers for a moment.					RIKER			At one point they were at Deep			Space Nine, trying to sell			bilitrium explosives.					K'MTAR			That was months ago. No one knows			where they went from there.	Again, K'mtar's tone is sharp, unnecessarily harsh.	Riker keeps his cool, responds evenly.      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO      20.9    CONTINUED: (4)					RIKER			Maybe we can find out.				(beat)			We've arranged quarters for you,			if you'd like to stay aboard.					K'MTAR			I would. Worf and I have much to			discuss.	Riker stands and the meeting breaks up.10   OMITTED11   INT. WORF'S QUARTERS	where Worf and K'mtar are talking. Worf is annoyed	with how K'mtar treated Riker, but K'mtar is oblivious.					K'MTAR			I'll send Kurn a message telling			him what happened, but it will be			days before he receives it -- he's			gone to the Hitora colony as			Gowron's representative.					WORF			K'mtar, why did you treat			Commander Riker so			disrespectfully?	K'mtar looks utterly baffled by Worf's statement.					WORF			You were... rude.					K'MTAR			I may have been rude by human			standards, but I meant no			disrespect.					(MORE)      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO      21.11   CONTINUED:					K'MTAR (Cont'd)			What's the matter Worf, have you			been living among humans so long			that you've forgotten how Klingons			behave?	Though he says this with a smile, Worf senses something	more underneath it.					WORF			I have not forgotten... I am			merely pointing out that their			ways our different from ours.					K'MTAR			I trust you've made your son aware			of that fact, as well?	Worf reacts, unsure what K'mtar is implying.					WORF			Of course I have.					K'MTAR			Good. Because someday Alexander			may be called upon to lead the			house of Mogh. Kurn has no male			heir, and he wants to be sure that			Alexander is preparing himself.	Worf's reaction is a bit defensive.					WORF			Does my brother doubt my ability			to raise my son as a Klingon?					K'MTAR			No. But you are alone among			humans. It cannot be easy to keep			our ways.	This strikes a nerve.					WORF			No... it has not been easy.					K'MTAR			How are his fighting skills? Can			he handle a Bat'leth?        STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - 01/28/94 - ACT TWO        21A.11   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			He is learning... he could be			better.					K'MTAR			He must be. He's not far from the			age of ascension.	Worf is reluctant to admit it, but he feels he must.					WORF			Actually... Alexander has not			committed himself to undergoing			the rite.					K'MTAR			What?      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO      22.11   CONTINUED: (3)					WORF			I have tried to make him see how			important it is, but he will not			listen to me.					K'MTAR			Perhaps together, you and I can			find a way to spark the boy's			interest in his heritage.					WORF			I would be grateful for any help			you could give.					K'MTAR			Tomorrow, then.	K'mtar stands to go, then casts a glance toward the	bedroom.					K'MTAR				(continuing)			May I say goodnight to him?					WORF			Of course.	Worf and K'mtar cross toward the other room.12   INT. BEDROOM	as K'mtar goes to sit next to Alexander, who's tucked	in under a blanket. Worf hangs back by the door.	K'mtar picks up a picture of K'Ehlyer next to the bed.	His attitude to Alexander is considerably less gruff.					K'MTAR			Is this your mother?					ALEXANDER			She died when I was little.      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO      23.12   CONTINUED:					K'MTAR			You miss her a great deal, don't			you... ?	Alexander only nods, but it's clear that he does.	K'mtar puts the picture back.					K'MTAR			It must be hard for you... being			the only Klingon your age on board			this ship.					ALEXANDER			Sometimes...	Worf is surprised to hear the gentleness in this	otherwise cantankerous man.					K'MTAR			Have you ever been to the			homeworld?					ALEXANDER			No...					K'MTAR			I think you'd like it there. At			your uncle's house there is a lake			where you can swim. The water is			so clear you can see to the			bottom.					ALEXANDER			Really?					K'MTAR			And you have cousins there. They			want to meet you.	Alexander looks away, troubled by something.					ALEXANDER			I don't know...	K'mtar seems to know just what it is -- as though he	has a line directly into Alexander's heart.        STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - 01/28/94 - ACT TWO        23A.12   CONTINUED: (2)					K'MTAR			I understand. You're afraid...			you don't know if the Home World			is safe.	Alexander looks at him, amazed that this gentle man	seems to know just what he's feeling.					ALEXANDER			Yes...	K'mtar smiles and puts a hand on Alexander's shoulder,	comforting.					K'MTAR			What happened today... on the			planet... was frightening.			You're still troubled...      STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO      24.12   CONTINUED: (3)					ALEXANDER			I thought they were going to kill			my father.	K'mtar nods sympathetically...					K'MTAR			You must have wanted to help us			fight them off.					ALEXANDER			I didn't know what to do...					K'MTAR			Someday, if you work hard, you'll			be a warrior... a Klingon warrior,			and you'll always feel safe			because you'll know how to defend			yourself. And do you know what			else? If anyone ever tries to			hurt your father again, you'll be			able to fight at his side and make			sure nothing happens to him. What			do you think of that?	Alexander smiles -- he's struck by this image of	himself as older and stronger, and comforted by how	empowered it makes him feel.					K'MTAR			Good night, Alexander. Dream			well.					ALEXANDER			Good night, K'mtar.	Alexander turns his face into his pillow and closes his	eyes, comforted and able to sleep now. K'mtar	exchanges a look with Worf, who has watched this tender	scene with amazement.									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT TWO                               STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE     25.                           ACT THREE                            	FADE IN:13   INT.

I told			you that you were a relic of an			earlier time, and that a new era			of peace was at hand.	He looks down, ashamed.					K'MTAR				(continuing)			But you were right. My enemies			saw my weakness... and they moved			against me.	He looks up at his father, tears in his eyes.          STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT FIVE         56.32   CONTINUED: (4)					K'MTAR				(continuing)			Unless I stop it all now...				(gestures to door)			-- that boy will see his father			killed on the floor of the Council			Chamber.	Worf tries to make sense of it all.					WORF			That's why you wanted to take			Alexander away. To turn him into			a warrior, not a peacemaker.					K'MTAR			I staged the assassination attempt			to frighten him... make him			realize he must learn the ways of			a warrior.	Worf turns away, hearing the familiarity of those	words.					K'MTAR				(continuing)			If I had listened to you... if I			had become the warrior you			wanted... you would not have died			in my arms.	Worf reaches out, touches the shoulder of his son...	his son who is older than he is, now. He is struggling	to come to some resolution of his own ideals, hoping to	communicate to Alexander a truth that will soothe him.					K'MTAR				(continuing)			Who is to say what the future will			be now, after you have disrupted			time? I may die tomorrow... or I			may outlive you.	He hesitates, looking for the words to reach his son.					WORF			But when I die... I would like an			honorable death. And the only way			that is possible -- is for you			accept yourself, as you are, and			stay true to what you believe.          STAR TREK: "Firstborn" - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT FIVE        56A.32   CONTINUED: (5)	K'mtar listens carefully.					WORF			The cause of peace is a worthy			one... go back, and continue to			work for it.
