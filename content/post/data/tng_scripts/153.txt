SICKBAY	Picard is standing in the doorway. Beverly stands over	the bed holding Marla Aster's body. Worf stands	nearby. His uniform bears the evidence of the recent	violent encounter, blood still seeps from his wound.					PICARD (V.O)				(continuing)			Lieutenant Marla Aster, ship's			archaeologist has been killed in			what should have been a routine			mission. Whatever the			explanation, it will not bring			back a valued and trusted officer.	A MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARY moves the bed Aster's body is	resting on into an isolated area of Sickbay.

I've alerted the			teacher to expect us.	Picard acknowledges. He glances at Beverly, who is	still troubled by the loss of a patient, but can	identify with the Captain's unpleasant task. Picard	and Troi then turn and prepare to leave the Sickbay.					WORF			Captain.	Worf swings off the biobed.					WORF				(continuing)			I must accompany you.

WORF'S QUARTERS	The room is very dark. Worf is dressed in an elaborate	Klingon robe and sash. A strange, twisted, massive	candle burns on the desk before him.	He studies the candle with painful eyes for several	beats and then hangs his head with shame. He reaches	out very deliberately, and snuffs the candle with the	flat side of a knife blade. Darkness.									CUT TO:      STAR TREK: "The Bonding" - REV. 8/25/89 - ACT ONE      9.10A  INT.

But did Jeremy Aster			make that choice?					TROI			Death and loss are an integral			part of life everywhere. Leaving			the boy on Earth would not have			protected him from that.					PICARD			No, but Earth is not likely to			be ordered to the Neutral Zone			to repel a Romulan attack...				(beat, softer)			It was my command which sent his			mother to her death.

CLASSROOM	Picard and Troi ENTER. The classroom is warm, inviting	and is crammed with plants, computers, antique books,	and myriad games from across the Federation. TWO	TEACHERS are working with SEVERAL STUDENTS in two study	groups.	In one group, the age of the students run from roughly	8 to 13, and they are discussing a particular problem	on a computer display screen around which they are all	clustered. In the B.G., is the other study group	studying other instruction devices. As Picard and Troi	enter, the students look up in surprise and several	point at the seldom-seen Captain of their ship.	Conversation dies to a whisper. The nearest teacher	hates like hell what his student is about to endure,	but he stands and crosses to JEREMY ASTER.					TEACHER			Jeremy, the Captain needs to talk			with you.	The boy's eyes go wide at this summons from the	Captain. He is about twelve years old and has a quiet,	sensitive look about him, with tousled black hair and	deep-set eyes.     STAR TREK: "The Bonding" - REV. 8/25/89 - ACT ONE     10A.12   CONTINUED:	The other children look at him with reactions ranging	from jealousy to fear.

TEACHER'S OFFICE (FROM SCENE 13)	Troi has her hands on Jeremy's shoulders to offer the	support of physical contact.					PICARD			Jeremy, it is my sad duty to tell			you that your mother has died.	And whatever our expectations might have been, we can	throw them away. This is a 24th century child. He is	a good soldier, uniquely mature. Prepared by experts	to cope with the worst circumstances. There is no tear	shed.					JEREMY			How, sir?					PICARD			An explosive device at the mission			site. She died instantly.					JEREMY			I understand.	Troi drops to one knee to be at his level...					TROI			I know your mother loved you very			much, Jeremy.	He nods. A silence.       STAR TREK: "The Bonding" - REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE     12        13A  CONTINUED:					PICARD			I've been told... you've also lost			your father.					JEREMY			Yessir. Five years ago. From			a Rushton Infection. I'm alone			now, sir.	And Picard may wonder just how 'mature' any of us could	be in this circumstance.

Troi is seated, watching Jeremy with	that cool serenity which is so much a part of her	nature. He doesn't quite know what to do with himself.	But throughout the scene there is a repressed anger	in the boy. (NOTE: This is a significant change...	Even though the dialogue may be similar, the attitude	behind must reflect unfocused anger that he is	unwilling to touch.)					JEREMY			I really ought to get back to			class... if I get behind...	Bringing the focus back --					TROI			I'm sure your mom wanted you to			do well in school.

He is completely unaware he is	doing this, but Troi has spotted the motion.					TROI			It might help if we talked about			how you're feeling.	Curt --					JEREMY			You're a Betazoid. You know how			I feel.					TROI				(conversationally)			When my father died we were living			on Betazed. My mother and all			her people are telepathic. I kept			wanting to talk about my father,			and they kept pulling my thoughts			out of my head before I could say			the words. It made me very angry.					JEREMY				(curious despite				 himself)			Why?					TROI			I needed to say them out loud.			I was confused about why he went			away. Was it me -- something I			had done. I felt that if I could			just say the words he would			somehow know how much I loved him			and missed him.	She looks at him.     STAR TREK: "The Bonding" - REV. 8/25/89 - ACT TWO     15.16   CONTINUED: (2)					TROI				(continuing)			I thought you might feel the same			way.					JEREMY				(avoiding his				 feelings)			She just had to do her job.

Still no tears. He nods his	head, yes, sighs a deep breath. Troi knows that's a	big step for now.					TROI				(standing; continuing)			I want you to have some time			alone for a little while. I'll			come back when you're ready to			talk again.					JEREMY			How will you know?	Troi crosses to the boy, hugs him lightly, then still	holding him in the circle of her arms she smiles down	at him and says,					TROI			This time I will use my Betazoid			sense, and I'll know.	His eyes say he's beginning to appreciate her.
