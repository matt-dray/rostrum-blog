I can see			it... but I can't remember			anything else about it...					TARMIN (o.c.)			When you see it... do you hear			any sounds?	The man's voice is gentle, coaxing. Keiko tries to	concentrate.					KEIKO			No... I don't think so... wait,			yes...	She tilts her head slightly, as though trying to hear	better.					KEIKO			Humming...				(as if listening)			Someone's humming...      STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 10/28/91 - TEASER      2.2    CONTINUED:					TARMIN (o.c.)			A woman.					KEIKO			Yes... but I don't know who it			is...	CUT to reveal we are --3    INT. TEN FORWARD	Keiko sits at a table opposite a large,	powerfully-built alien named TARMIN, 50's, whose eyes	are closed as he concentrates on the same images as	Keiko. Tarmin's hand touches his head. A	white-haired female alien, INAD, quite a bit older than	Tarmin, sits beside him. A third alien, JEV,	Tarmin's attractive son, 30's, stands and observes.	Also observing are RIKER, GEORDI, and BEVERLY, who seem	to be fascinated by this process.					TARMIN			Try to touch the cup.	Keiko looks at him, unsure what he means, then closes	her eyes and tentatively reaches out her hand.									SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:4    A CHILD'S HAND - INSERT	touching the side of the cup, then running a finger	along its rim, reaching a sharp-edged chip and abruptly	pulling back. (NOTE: These cuts are all inserts, very	close-up, revealing nothing of the surrounding.)5    RESUME SCENE	Keiko pulls her hand back as well, opens her eyes.					KEIKO			It has a sharp edge where it's			chipped.					TARMIN			Is there anything inside the cup?	Keiko concentrates, trying to see the image.      STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 10/28/91 - TEASER      3.5    CONTINUED:					KEIKO			A liquid... dark...					TARMIN			Like tea...									SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:6    A CHILD'S HAND - INSERT	quickly dipping two fingers inside the cup.7    OMITTED8    RESUME SCENE					KEIKO			It's not hot...	Keiko puts the same two fingers into her mouth, as if	to taste the liquid, then scrunches up her nose.					KEIKO			Bitter...					TARMIN			There's something else in the			cup...					KEIKO			Yes... with a wooden handle...					TARMIN			A spoon...					KEIKO			No... It's more delicate than			that.					TARMIN			Reach for it.									SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:9    A CHILD'S HAND - INSERT	reaching for the wooden handle, pulling out a JAPANESE	INK BRUSH.      STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 10/28/91 - TEASER      4.10   RESUME SCENE					KEIKO			It's a brush! An ink brush.									SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:11   THE INK BRUSH - INSERT	in the child's hands, one holding the brush, the other	touching the bristles.12   RESUME SCENE					KEIKO			I hear that humming again.					TARMIN			Keep listening to it, and hold			out the brush. See if someone			takes it from you.	Keiko extends her hand, as if it held a brush in it.									SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:13   AN OLD WOMAN'S HAND - INSERT	reaching for the brush, taking it by the handle.14   RESUME KEIKO					KEIKO			It's Obachan! My grandmother.			She's doing brush writing. I			remember it now!	Tarmin opens his eyes, pleased with himself.					KEIKO			She used that cup for cleaning			the brush, and it was my job to			fill it with water and bring it			to the table.				(remembering)			I'd sit beside her and watch the			most beautiful characters come			from that brush. And the whole			time, she'd be humming to herself.					(MORE)      STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 10/28/91 - TEASER      5.14   CONTINUED:					KEIKO (cont'd)				(smiles, amazed)			It's like it was yesterday.					BEVERLY			You remember such vivid details...			it's remarkable.					KEIKO			For years I've seen that old cup			in my memory... but I could never			recall what it was or why it was			important.				(to Tarmin)			Thank you.					TARMIN			You're very welcome, young lady.	He looks around at the group.					TARMIN			Perhaps someone else would care			to try?	Inad and Jev react to this, uncomfortable with Tarmin	"soliciting" the group. Tarmin fixes his eyes on	Beverly.					TARMIN			You, madam... you're thinking of			that first childhood kiss.			Wouldn't you like to remember			more about it?	Beverly is amazed by this, but Jev remonstrates his	father.					JEV			Father, you know you're not			supposed to probe someone's			memories unless they've given you			permission.					TARMIN			You're right... but sometimes with			a beautiful woman -- I can't help			myself.	There is good-natured laughter at this.         STAR TREK: "Violations" - 10/25/91 - TEASER         6.14   CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI				(to Riker)			What about you, Commander? Any			memories you feel like digging			up?					RIKER				(grinning)			None that I'd want to share with			an audience.	Geordi and the others grin at this; Keiko stands.					KEIKO			I'd better be going... it's			getting late.	The group disperses, Riker and Geordi moving to the	exit, some of the others moving off in little groups.	CAMERA drops off on Jev, who stands alone, an enigmatic	look on his face.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 11/25/91 - ACT ONE      7.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            	EXT.

CORRIDOR	Geordi and Data walking along a corridor.					DATA			It is perplexing to me that the			Ullians' ability to retrieve			memory is so sought after. If			an event is important enough to			be recovered... why would it have			been forgotten?	Geordi ponders how to explain this.					GEORDI			It's not quite the same for us			as it is for you, Data. You			record every second of every event			in your life...					DATA			That is correct.					GEORDI			And if you want to recall any one			of those seconds, you just access			the proper memory circuit.					DATA			My understanding of the Human			brain suggests that the process			is the same for you.					(MORE)     STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 11/25/91 - ACT ONE     7A.	CONTINUED:					DATA (cont'd)			Each memory is encoded in chains			of molecules, and when you want			to retrieve it, you simply access			the proper RNA sequence.					GEORDI			Well, yeah, that's true...					DATA			Then in what way is it different?					GEORDI			Sometimes... There are memories			we just can't tap into. For			instance... I have no recollection			of what I did on my last birthday.			Birthdays are important			occasions... you'd think I'd			remember how I spent the day.			But I can't even remember where			I was.	They reach a turbolift, and the doors open.	INT. TURBOLIFT	as they enter.					GEORDI			Deck two. On the other hand --			I remember everything about the			time I got my first pet... a			Circassian cat. I was eight. I			remember how funny he looked...			how excited I was... it's as if			it happened last week.					DATA			Perhaps you remember the pleasant			memories and forget the unpleasant			ones?					GEORDI			Well, not really. Sometimes the			bad memories are the most intense			of all.	Data finds this all very difficult to follow.     STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 11/25/91 - ACT ONE     7B.B14	CONTINUED:					DATA			It would seem there is no			predictable pattern to Human			memory.	Geordi is grateful for this summation -- any summation	-- of an inexplicable subject.					GEORDI			It would seem.	The turbolift doors open and they EXIT.15   INT. DINING ROOM	An elegant dinner is being served to the Enterprise's	guests of honor: Tarmin, the delegation leader, Inad,	and Jev. PICARD, Riker, WORF, DATA, Geordi, TROI, and	Beverly are present.					JEV			This "library" of ours has been			in the planning stages for years			-- a collection of the retrieved			memories of races from many			different star systems --	We sense that Jev is sincere and idealistic about this	dream; Tarmin, however, wants center stage, and	interrupts him. Jev subsides, though he's annoyed.					TARMIN			What my son means to say is --			we think of ourselves as			"archaeologists of the mind." We			believe that the history of a			world is contained in the personal			experiences of its people.					PICARD			Rather like the ancient oral			historians of Earth.					TARMIN			Exactly. The library we propose			will be a vast storehouse of these			individual memories.					RIKER			Sounds like quite a project...			how long will it take to finish			your studies on Kaldra?     STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 11/25/91 - ACT ONE     7C.15   CONTINUED:					INAD			Many months. We have been working			for years, and have surveyed only			eleven planets in eight star			systems.      STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT ONE      8.15   CONTINUED:					JEV			But it's our way of life. We			wouldn't want to do anything else.					BEVERLY				(with feigned innocence)			Captain, Mister Tarmin gave us			a demonstration of his abilities			this afternoon. It's fascinating.			Perhaps you'd like to resurrect			some memories...	She smiles sweetly as Picard gives her a piercing look.	Tarmin, oblivious to the teasing, leaps in, eager to	pick up on the opportunity.					TARMIN			I'd be happy to probe your			recollections, Captain. Most			people find it an enjoyable			experience.					PICARD			I'm sure. However, I don't think			I'm a particularly good candidate			--					BEVERLY				(gently twisting)			I'm sure you'd be ideal. And you			must have some intriguing			memories...					TARMIN			We won't be on your ship for long.			This might be your last			opportunity...					PICARD			Yes, well...					INAD				(gently admonishing)			Tarmin, you mustn't influence			people. They must come to you			willingly.	Tarmin shrugs. We sense that he enjoys his work,	likes to show off a little -- to the consternation of	the more serious, straight-laced Ullians.      STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT ONE      9.15   CONTINUED: (2)					TARMIN			I have found... over the years...			that there are many who want the			experience of memory retrieval...			but who need some encouragement			in order to come forward.	He turns and looks around; his eye falls on Worf.					TARMIN			You, Mister Worf? I would love			to explore Klingon memories.					WORF			Klingons do not allow themselves			to be "probed."					TARMIN			There is nothing to fear...					JEV				(cautioning)			Father...					WORF			I am not fearful.					TARMIN			Commander La Forge... you?					GEORDI			I don't think so. Thanks anyway.					TARMIN			I have rarely encountered such			squeamish people! Doctor			Crusher... Commander Riker... ?	Tarmin's pushiness is becoming a bit much; Troi comes	in to smooth things over.					TROI			Mister Tarmin, are all Ullians			able to read memories?					TARMIN			No, my dear. The technique			requires special training. It			is a serious commitment.     STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 11/22/91 - ACT ONE     10-10B      15   CONTINUED: (3)					INAD			It takes years of study. Tarmin			is the most proficient of our			group.					TARMIN			Once Jev spent two days with a			contingent of elderly Gentons.			He couldn't get a thing from them.			I worked with them for one hour			and recovered a missing fragment			of the Gentonian trade wars.	Jev colors at this public put-down. He's had enough.					JEV			Excuse me.	He rises and heads for the exit. There's an awkward	pause.					INAD				(smoothly)			Exactly how long will it be before			we reach Kaldra, Captain?	Over the next, Troi rises and follows Jev.					PICARD			Mister Data?					DATA			Four days, eleven hours, sir.16   INT. CORRIDOR	Jev is standing outside a turbolift as Troi rounds the	corner.					TROI			Jev...	He turns and sees her. Lets out an exasperated sigh.					JEV			I'm sorry. I'm being rude.					TROI			No, not at all...     STAR TREK: "Violations" - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT ONE     11.16   CONTINUED:					JEV			My father finds it amusing to			demean me in public.

But, I			do know a certain Betazoid mother			who is a great deal like your			father.	Jev smiles at this, relaxing a bit in this sharing of	grievances. The turbolift doors open and they ENTER.16A  INT. TURBOLIFT					TROI			Deck eight. I've learned to			remind myself that my mother and			I are two separate individuals.					JEV			Deck sixteen. And have you had			much success with this approach,			Counselor?	She takes a breath as if to speak... stops herself,	ponders for a moment... then looks right at him.					TROI			No... but I keep reminding myself.	He laughs, she does, too... she's managed to ease his	overreaction to his father's self-aggrandizement.
