MAIN BRIDGE - ON WESLEY	at helm, DATA at Ops, WORF at his Tactical position.3    MOVE PAST THEM SLOWLY	as RIKER walks from Command to the Aft Science Station	where GEORDI is studying a sensor readout screen of	the planet's atmosphere and surface.					RIKER (V.O.)				(continuing)			... the planet furthest from its			sun in this previously unmapped			solar system. It is a world of			ruthless realities: particularly			harsh, barren, and inhospitable...4    ANGLE UP ON GEORDI'S FACE	reflecting the screen's amber light. Riker STEPS INTO	FRAME behind him...					RIKER (V.O.)				(continuing)			Our reason for being here -- a			passing Klingon cruiser reported			discovering pieces of a strange			vessel in the upper atmosphere.			We've come to investigate...         STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - TEASER         2.4    CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(studying the screen)			Nasty. Nitrogen... methane...			liquid neon. Surface temperature			minus two hundred and ninety-one			degrees Fahrenheit. Winds up to			three hundred and twelve meters			per second.					RIKER			Not exactly a vacation planet,			eh?					GEORDI			Uh uh. Not unless you like			ammonia tornadoes. Or orange			lightning bolts for that matter.					RIKER				(smiling)			Not my cup of tea. Found anything			artificial in the atmosphere?					GEORDI			Nothing so far. We're just coming			around to the night side now.					RIKER			Keep me informed. The sooner we			identify what the Klingons think			they saw, the sooner we can get			the hell out of here.					GEORDI			Sounds good to me.5    STAY ON GEORDI	as Riker walks away. He shakes his head as more data	return from the surface of Theta Eight...					GEORDI				(to himself)			Nasty.6    INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM	PICARD sits on a chair staring at a tabletop viewer.	It has a number of equations and theorems on it -- like	a present-day blackboard. The door CHIMES.         STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - TEASER         3.6    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Come.	Riker ENTERS, looks at the viewscreen.					PICARD				(continuing)			Fermat's last theorem. Familiar			with it?					RIKER			No. I'm afraid I spent too many			math classes daydreaming about			being on a starship.					PICARD			It's intriguing. When Fermat died			they found scrawled in the margin			of his notes that he had found			a "remarkable proof."				(beat)			Unfortunately he never lived to			write it down. And for the last			eight hundred years people have			been trying to rediscover it.					RIKER			And that includes you?					PICARD			I find the process relaxing.					RIKER				(changing the subject)			We've detected debris of some sort			in a loose orbit.					PICARD			Can you identify?					RIKER			I suggest we beam a section aboard			for analysis.					PICARD			Make it so, Number One.7    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - PICARD (OPTICAL)	ENTERS and goes to where Riker is standing by the	platform. He nods to O'BRIEN standing at the console.         STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - TEASER         4.7    CONTINUED:					PICARD			Energize.	Riker explains as a piece of the debris begins to	MATERIALIZE:					RIKER			We've locked onto something with			markings on it.					PICARD			What sort of markings?					RIKER			Uncertain, sir.	A large chunk of jagged metal MATERIALIZES on the	platform. It seems featureless, the color of brushed	aluminum. Picard is intrigued -- he touches it and	spots something as he turns it over...					PICARD			There's something here.	Riker goes to see what Picard has found.					PICARD				(continuing; frowning)			That symbol... Do you recognize			it?					RIKER				(quietly stunned)			Yes sir. I -- I think I do.8    REVERSE ANGLE	to see what they're seeing.9    MOVE IN ON THE SYMBOL	a white five-pointed star on a dark blue circular	background intersected by red and white horizontal	lines on either side.	It is the insignia of the United States Air Force...									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE        5.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:10   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	seen from a different angle, still in orbit around	Theta Eight.11   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - PICARD	Riker, Data and TROI are gathered to discuss the	debris...					DATA			Metallic analysis bears out that			the object in question was			terrestrial in origin. Most			likely late twenty-first century.					PICARD			But that's not possible. No ship			of that time period could have			come this far.					DATA			Nevertheless, that is what our			tests indicate. And the markings			we discovered are consistent with			this hypothesis.					TROI			Any idea what destroyed it? An			explosion of some sort?					DATA			Unknown.					PICARD			The question is, how did it get			here?	Picard's train of thought is interrupted by the	INTERCOM...					WESLEY'S COM VOICE			Captain. We've detected a large			structure on the planet.        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE        6.12   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CLOSE ON SCREEN	Wesley and the others are studying the sensor readout	screen.					DATA			It is a building of some sort,			situated on a plane of frozen			methane, smack in the middle of			a tremendous storm belt. It is			incongruous; it simply should not			be there!					PICARD			Are you certain it's artificially			constructed?					DATA			Absolutely. The structure is			surrounded by breathable air.	Picard steps back, taking it all in.					RIKER			It's hard to accept...					PICARD			Yet it does seem to be down there.			Is there a connection between the			structure and the ship?	No one seems to have an answer to this.					PICARD				(continuing)			Suggestions?					RIKER				(small smile)			Only one, sir. Suggest we go down			and have a look.					PICARD			Form an away team, minimal			complement.13   MOVE IN	on a thoughtful, determined Picard.					PICARD			Let's see if we can find the			architects.        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE        7.14   OMITTED15   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ON DATA AND WORF	checking equipment, standing on the transporter	platform. Over at the transporter panel, O'BRIEN	looks up.					O'BRIEN			Give me a moment, gents. We're			dealing with an extremely narrow			access point.16   OMITTED17   RIKER (OPTICAL)	steps on platform.					RIKER			We're ready when you are...				(then to Worf)			Phasers on stun.	They adjust their phasers. Riker looks to O'Brien.	O'Brien nods.					RIKER				(continuing)			Energize.	O'Brien complies, and the party of three is BEAMED	AWAY.18   EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DATA, WORF AND RIKER (OPTICAL)	MATERIALIZE in a featureless black void. It is	completely still, no sound, no movement. The calm is	unnerving.					RIKER				(tense)			Where are we?	Data checks his tricorder.					DATA			Exactly where Geordi said we would			be. The structure is directly			behind us.        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE        8.18   CONTINUED:	They all turn and look behind them. All they can see	is blackness...					DATA				(continuing)			I am detecting vast ammonia storms			raging mere kilometers away. Yet			they do not appear to penetrate			this breathable zone.					RIKER				(soft, awed)			It's like the eye of a hurricane.	Data has wandered toward where he believes the	structure to be. He looks up, as though sensing the	hugeness of the thing.					DATA			It is here. It must be here, yet			we cannot see it.19   INTERCUT WITH PICARD ON THE MAIN BRIDGE					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Enterprise, this is Commander			Riker. We have arrived in a very			unusual place... it is like being			in the eye of a hurricane. It			is completely calm, no sound, no			movement, yet a few meters away			a storm, which we can neither see			nor hear, is raging.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			Describe the structure.					RIKER			We can't see it.					WORF			Commander, over here. I see			something!	Data and Riker hurry over to Worf. The Klingon has	discovered an old-fashioned revolving door, seemingly	situated in the middle of nothing. It turns slowly, as	though beckoning them...        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE        9.19   CONTINUED:					WORF				(continuing)			What is this thing?					PICARD'S COM VOICE			What is it, Commander?					RIKER				(to Picard, amazed)			I think it's a door. An antique.					DATA			Judging by its location, it may			be an entrance to the structure			we seek.	The three of them exchange wary glances...					RIKER			Well... this is what we came here			for.				(to Picard)			Captain, we are entering the			structure.	Riker cautiously steps in and the revolving door	automatically turns to the right. Riker disappears	into the darkness, and when the door stops revolving he	is gone. Worf looks at Data and then follows suit.	Data follows him...20   INT. ROYALE LOBBY - DATA	steps out of the revolving door and joins the others	inside the structure. They are standing on a garish	carpet, scarlet with gold trim. All are looking around	incredulously as we HEAR THE SOUND OF A SLOT MACHINE	hitting a jackpot and the tumult of a casino in full	swing.21   ANGLE TO REVEAL THEIR WHEREABOUTS	inside the lobby of a small Vegas-style hotel, roughly	our time period. To their right is a front desk beside	some elevators. To the left is a modest casino with	blackjack tables, crap tables and roulette wheels, all	flanked by a row of slot machines and a lounge with a	piano player.        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE        10.21   CONTINUED:	There is a bustle of activity on all sides. People are	gambling, hotel workers are scurrying about. No one	is paying much attention to the three stunned	strangers. Riker touches his communicator.					RIKER			Riker to Enterprise. We have			entered the structure.				(then, realizing)			We're not getting through.22   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - PICARD	stands between Wesley and an n.d. crewmember at Conn	and Ops. Troi can be seen sitting at the Command	Section with Geordi still at the Aft Station.					PICARD			Where's that interference			originating?					GEORDI			From the source, sir. Cause...			unknown.					PICARD			Lock onto the landing party.			Have the Transporter Room prepare			to beam them up.	Geordi shakes his head as he studies the screen...					GEORDI			We can't distinguish them as long			as they're inside that structure.					PICARD			Can they hear us?					GEORDI			We've got to recalibrate all			frequencies.					PICARD			Make it so.23   INT. ROYALE LOBBY - RIKER	is touching his communicator, frustrated.        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE        11.23   CONTINUED:					DATA			Without radio contact, we should			leave immediately.					RIKER			Agreed. We'll make a preliminary			sweep of this environment and then			return.	A BELLBOY, a Latino in his mid-twenties, nervously	looks them over as if he is expecting someone else.					BELLBOY			Checking in, gentlemen? You'll			have to go to the front desk.	He indicates the front desk and then moves off before	our people can respond. What follows plays off the	point of view of Riker and the others. Riker thinks	about what he said and then heads for the front desk.	Worf and Data follow him, still looking around in	wonder.	A SLIGHTLY BUILT MAN WITH PERFECT HAIR stands behind	the counter, underneath a sign that says REGISTRATION.	The name tag on his lapel reads "ASSISTANT MANAGER."	He's the type of assistant manager we've all met at	one time or another: polite in a routine, impersonal	and annoying way, fastidious and slightly effeminate.					ASSISTANT MANAGER			Welcome, gentlemen. Have a nice			trip?	Riker looks at Worf quizzically.					RIKER			Uh... Do you know us?					ASSISTANT MANAGER			We've been expecting you. A trio			of foreign gentlemen.					RIKER			We're from the United Federation			of Planets --					ASSISTANT MANAGER			Of course. Welcome to The Hotel			Royale...        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE        12.23   CONTINUED: (2)	The Bellboy comes up beside the assistant manager,	interrupting:					BELLBOY				(urgently)			Did Rita call?					ASSISTANT MANAGER			No -- and for your own good you			had better quit thinking about			Rita.					BELLBOY			I'm not afraid of him.					ASSISTANT MANAGER			Then you're a fool. Everybody			with any sense is afraid of Mikey			D.					BELLBOY				(waves off the thought				 of Mikey D)			If Rita calls -- you let me know.	He then turns and walks away.					ASSISTANT MANAGER				(confidentially to				 Riker)			The kid's just askin' for trouble			-- Rita's too much for him to			handle, and Mikey D will plant			his face in the pavement.				(then, handing them				 to Riker)			Now, here are your room keys and			some complimentary casino chips.			Enjoy!	Riker and Worf don't know what any of this means.					WORF			What is this place? How did a			being like you get here?	The assistant manager finally looks up.        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE        13.23   CONTINUED: (3)					ASSISTANT MANAGER			Why this is the Royale, of			course. And my personal life is			really none of your business,			thank you.	He looks back down again...					RIKER			What he means is, what planet			is this?	The assistant manager SIGHS and faces Riker...					ASSISTANT MANAGER			I beg your pardon?					RIKER			This planet. What do you call			it?					ASSISTANT MANAGER				(rolling his eyes)			Earth.				(very dry)			What do you call it?	Riker and Worf are stunned to hear him mention Earth.					WORF			We call it Theta Eight.					ASSISTANT MANAGER			How charming.	This time the assistant manager spins and begins to	EXIT the area behind the desk.					DATA			Commander...					RIKER			Yes Data?					DATA				(reading from his				 tricorder)			None of these people... are			emitting life signs.					WORF			You mean they're not alive?        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE        14.24   OMITTED25   MOVE IN ON RIKER	looking around at the "people" moving about the lobby	with more than a little concern.					RIKER				(more to himself)			Then what are they?...									FADE OUT.                        END OF ACT ONE                                  STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT TWO        15.                            ACT TWO                             	FADE IN:26   INT.

They			do exist, but they do not register			as either man or machine.	Just then, a cheerful, burly, MIDDLE-AGED MAN wearing	a huge tan-colored Stetson (we'll call him TEXAS) comes	out of the elevator behind Data. The android turns	his tricorder on him...					DATA				(continuing)			For example, this creature			exhibits no DNA structure.	Texas overhears and replies in a Texas twang...					TEXAS			Look who's talkin'.				(to Riker)			He sounds just like my ex-wife.	Texas shakes his head and mutters to himself as he	hobbles OUT OF FRAME. We can hear him BELLOW OUT as	he reaches the casino O.S.					TEXAS				(continuing)			Aaaaall right!! Time to get back			to business!					DATA			What sort of business do you			suppose he is getting down to?        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT TWO        16.26   CONTINUED:	Curious, Data wanders toward the casino.

ROYALE CASINO - ENTRANCE - THE AWAY TEAM	are standing at the edge of the casino. We can hear	occasional SHOUTS OF ENTHUSIASM AND DESPAIR from the	gaming tables. Data quietly walks up to a table where	TWO HIGH-ROLLERS are playing blackjack surrounded by	onlookers and supporters.	THE DEALER is a twenty-eight year old black man, cool	and laid back. Texas sits to his right, while VANESSA	sits to his left.	Texas notices Data and motions him to come up beside	him. The dealer shuffles his decks as Texas converses	with the android, Data holding his complimentary chips	in his hand.        STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT TWO        17.31   CONTINUED:					TEXAS			You're new around here, aren't			you?					DATA			Yes. I have certainly never			visited this place, or its true			counterpart, before.					TEXAS				(re the game)			Sit down, boy. I'll show you how			this game is played.				(re Data's chips)			Go ahead. Ante up.	Texas does just that; Data follow suit. The dealer	has just finished shuffling. He slides the deck toward	Data... and waits.					DATA				(to Texas, frowning)			It seems he expects something of			me.					VANESSA			He wants you to cut the cards.					DATA			Ah, is this poker?					TEXAS			No, it's blackjack.					DATA			Also known as twenty-one, a			number which defines the object			of the game. Tens and picture			cards are worth ten, ace -- one			or eleven -- the other cards face			value. The dealer must hit			seventeen -- five cards under pays			double.					TEXAS			Not at this joint -				(to dealer)			Run 'em, boy. And make 'em			friendly.

Data follows	after, nodding at the other players and remembering	to take his two chips.40   INT.

I believe that their			final resting position is			adversely affected --	Riker reacts, realizing:					RIKER			Loaded dice.				(then, to Data)			Can you... "repair" them?					DATA			I believe so...85   ANGLE - DATA'S FINGERS	begin to apply android pressure to the dice.       STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT FIVE       44.86   DATA	blows on the dice and rolls again and now his face	lights up with the sound of:					TEXAS (O.S.)			Seven! A winner!	Data's money is quickly doubled; so is Vanessa's.	They both like it.					TEXAS			Attaboy! Just do that a few more			times and everybody's gonna get			well --	And as Data prepares to roll again now, we:									GO TO:87   THE ASSISTANT MANAGER	as he walks to the table with a tray of $100,000	placques. Data has quite a crowd around him now as	he continues his hot streak.					ASSISTANT MANAGER				(to croupier)			Who has the dice?	The croupier nods toward Data. At his side, Vanessa is	doing just fine, with more money in front of her than	she ever dreamed. Now, of course, Vanessa is all over	Texas like a cheap suit.					VANESSA			Oh, Tex, darlin', you're			brilliant!					TEXAS			Yeah. An' good lookin' too, huh?	Worf studies the action, leans over to his comrades.					WORF				(to Riker)			Isn't that enough?					RIKER			Almost. I don't want to be short,			that's for sure...				(then, to Data)			You are keeping count?       STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT FIVE       45.87   CONTINUED:	Data reaches down, touches the stack, pauses for a	moment, then whispers:					DATA			Eleven point three million.				(then, whimsically)			Perhaps I will bet it all --	Riker leans in to him, whispering urgently:					RIKER			No! Simply reach twelve million.					DATA			As you wish...	With that, Data rolls one last time and we hear:					ASSISTANT MANAGER (O.S.)			The man has the touch.	The croupier shoves more chips over to Data; Riker	leans in to Data with:					RIKER			Now.					DATA				(to the Croupier)			I would like to cash out, please.	The croupier blanches; he turns to the assistant	manager who steps up.					ASSISTANT MANAGER			I'm afraid you've broken the bank.			That's over twelve million --					RIKER			Twelve point five million to be			exact. The purchase price of			this hotel.					ASSISTANT MANAGER			That's impossible --	Riker smiles, holds up the novel.       STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT FIVE       46.87   CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			Wrong. We're the "foreign			Investors" on page 244. We're			buying you out, lock, stock, and			barrel.				(slides the chips toward				 the pit boss)			Consider it a "done deal."	The assistant manager reacts, stupefied, not knowing	how to react. Texas turns to them, wide-eyed.					TEXAS			Hey, y'know what? Y'all got			style! I like that! Let me buy			y'all a drink --	Riker smiles at him, reaches into Texas's coat pocket	and pulls out a big cigar. As he twirls it in his own	mouth:					RIKER			Enjoy the game, friend. And don't			let 'em change the dice on you.	With that, Riker leads Worf and Data away through the	crowd. The assistant manager, sweating nervously,	shouts out:					ASSISTANT MANAGER			Wait! You can't leave!					RIKER			Oh yeah? Watch us.				(then, wagging a finger				 at him)			Don't forget, we own the joint.	Riker leads them toward the revolving door in the	distance. Worf looks a bit worried, puffs himself up,	anticipating a struggle with strange physical elements	beyond his ken.					WORF			You're confident about this,			Commander?					RIKER			Focus. Concentrate. See only			where we want to BE, not where			we are.       STAR TREK: "The Royale" - 01/10/89 - ACT FIVE       47.87   CONTINUED: (3)					DATA			Ancient philosophical overtones			of thought process...
