ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR	Riker ENTERS the corridor as he is PAGED.					COMPUTER VOICE			Commander Riker, report to the			bridge.					RIKER			On the way.2    INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR	as Riker HURRIES to the turbolift. HARRY, a smallish	ten-year-old boy, runs down the corridor, head down,	colliding with Riker.					RIKER			What's your hurry, Harry?	Harry looks up at him, not believing what he's done.					HARRY			Oops. Sorry, Commander. I was,			um, just...					DR. BERNARD			Harry!	Harry's father, HARRY BERNARD, SR., APPEARS and is	furious with his son.					DR. BERNARD			I'm sorry if he bothered you.					RIKER			No bother, Doctor Bernard.	Riker limps slightly as he walks toward the turbolift.					HARRY			I'm not going back. I hate that			teacher. And I hate calculus.     STAR TREK: "When the Bough... " - 12/11/87 - TEASER     2.2    CONTINUED:					DR. BERNARD			Everyone needs an understanding			of basic calculus, whether they			like it or not.					HARRY			Why?	Riker REACTS to Harry's question with a smile.3    RIKER'S POV	From inside the turbolift, Riker watches Dr. Bernard	take his son by the hand and lead him back down the	corridor as the turbolift doors CLOSE.4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Riker LIMPS OFF the turbolift. PICARD is at the Aft	Station. The other CREWMEMBERS are at their positions.	BEVERLY is also at the Aft Station.					BEVERLY			You're limping.					RIKER			A small run-in with an aspiring			sprinter.					PICARD			Ah, Number One.					RIKER			A problem, Captain?					PICARD			A curiosity. For the past several			hours we have been tracking faint			energy readings in an attempt to			locate the source. It's been like			following a trail of bread crumbs.	Riker steps over to the Aft Station.					PICARD				(continuing)			The path lead here and stopped			-- which is what I knew would			interest you.     STAR TREK: "When the Bough... " - 12/11/87 - TEASER     3.4    CONTINUED:					RIKER				(to Geordi)			What's our position?					GEORDI			The Epsilon Mynos system.					RIKER				(with a look of				 surprise)			Really? Thank you, Captain;			you're right... I wouldn't miss			this for anything.					TASHA			What's so interesting about this			system?					RIKER			Aldea.	Tasha still doesn't get the point.					RIKER				(continuing; to Tasha)			Tasha -- I'm surprised. You mean			you've never heard the stories			about Aldea? A wonderous mythical			world -- like Atlantis on ancient			earth... or Neinman on Xerxes			Seven... with an advanced culture,			centuries old. Self-contained,			peaceful, with incredible			technical sophistication which			provided for every citizen's daily			needs, allowing them to devote			themselves to culture and art,			which was beautiful beyond compare			and valued beyond price.					TASHA			Where is it supposed to be?					RIKER			Ahh -- that is the myth -- somehow --			so the legend goes -- the Aldeans			were able to cloak their planet			in darkness and go unseen by			marauders and other hostile			passersby who might rob and			plunder.     STAR TREK: "When the Bough...

MAIN BRIDGE - MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)	There is nothing specifically visible on the Main	Viewer, except a SLIGHT BLURRING in the center.     STAR TREK: "When the Bough... " - 12/11/87 - TEASER     5.8    REACTIONS	as the crew puzzles over the unusual effect.					PICARD			Shields and deflectors up.					TASHA			Aye, sir.9    BACK TO SHOT (OPTICAL)	Suddenly, with a great, low-decibel NOISE like	BLANKETED THUNDER, which draws everyone's attention, a	huge planet begins to APPEAR on the viewer, clearing	until it's visible. It is a LIGHT GREEN, peaceful and	inviting, necklaced with a LIGHT FILM. Everyone stands	amazed, in awe.					RIKER				(almost breathless)			Aldea, Captain... It has to be.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              STAR TREK: "When the Bough...

SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as she maintains orbit around Aldea.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's log, stardate 41509.1.			Either by chance or intent, we've			been led to the mythical planet			of Aldea, which appeared out of			nowhere, hidden behind a			sophisticated shielding device.11   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Everyone is at stations.					DATA			Captain, the sensors indicate that			the shield is electromagnetic. A			complicated light refracting			mechanism.					PICARD			A cloaking device.					DATA			Yes, sir.					GEORDI			To hide an entire planet it's			gotta be pretty sophisticated.	Picard, Riker and Troi watch the planet.					WORF				(from Aft Station)			We're being scanned, sir.					PICARD			Let's let them know our peaceful			intent. Open hailing frequencies,			Lieutenant Yar.    STAR TREK: "When the Bough... " - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE    7.11   CONTINUED:	Before Tasha can comply, a WOMAN'S IMAGE MATERIALIZES	on the viewscreen, startling everyone. RASHELLA, a	melancholy beauty with almost translucent skin, is	shrouded in DIM LIGHT. She emanates a quiet tensile	strength, her body covered by the simplest utilitarian	clothes.					RASHELLA			I'm Rashella. Welcome to Aldea.					PICARD			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of			the USS Enterprise. We come in			peace.					RASHELLA			We know.					PICARD			We've heard the stories about			Aldea, but frankly never thought			they could possibly be true.					RASHELLA				(laughing)			Our shield has confused outsiders			for millennia, Captain.					PICARD			A very long time to have that kind			of technology. Why are you			revealing yourself now?					RASHELLA			We're eager to meet in person to			discuss that, and other subjects			of mutual interest.					PICARD			We're ready anytime.					RASHELLA			Excellent!	Instantly, THREE ALDEANS MATERIALIZE on the bridge.	The crew is stunned. Rashella; GAREN, a large	fierce-looking man; and behind them, RADUE, pale,	older, stately-looking, with great authority and kindly	eyes, and a squint at the brightness of the bridge.	They carry baskets filled with fruits and flowers.    STAR TREK: "When the Bough... " - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE    8.12   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	REACTIONS from the bridge personnel. All are taken	aback.					RASHELLA				(reacting to their				 astonishment)			Our arrival seems to have startled			you.					RADUE			We mean no harm.					PICARD			It was a little sudden					RADUE			I'm Radue, First Appointee of Aldea.					PICARD			Welcome aboard.					BEVERLY			Captain, they haven't been through			decontamination.	Picard waves her off.					PICARD			It's all right.				(to the Aldeans)			Our medical doctor is concerned			you didn't go through our regular			transporting procedure.					RASHELLA			You couldn't transport us. The			only way through our shield is			our way, Captain. Our cloaking			device may be off, but our shield			is operating. We've brought you			small tokens of welcome.	She hands Picard a basket of flowers and bows her head	to him slightly, then gestures to Garen, who offers his	basket of fruit to Tasha.					RADUE			And our personal invitation to			a celebration on Aldea.					PICARD			We'd be delighted. Number One,			assemble your away team.    STAR TREK: "When the Bough... " - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE    9.12   CONTINUED:					RADUE			We will prepare for your arrival,			Commander Riker.					RIKER			How did you know...					RADUE			... your name? We've been			monitoring your ship's			communications. We must return			now to Aldea. Our eyes are very			sensitive to bright light.			Rashella, Garen.	They use their arm devices and the three DISAPPEAR	from the bridge. Picard looks at Troi and Riker.					PICARD			Amazing. Only to exist in			mythology and suddenly they're			here, right in front of us.			Number One?					RIKER			Now you know who placed the			bread crumbs. We're not here by			accident.					PICARD			Counselor? What do you sense?					TROI			Only the obvious. They want			something from us.					RADUE'S COM VOICE			Commander Riker, is your party			ready?	The away team, not as normally constituted, DISAPPEARS	off the bridge. It includes only Riker, Troi and	Beverly, selected by the Aldeans. Picard looks around	at who is missing.					PICARD			Interesting choices.13   INT. ALDEA - FIRST UNIT CHAMBER (OPTICAL)	The away team MATERIALIZES in a spartan, white-walled	room with ancient hanging tapestries.    STAR TREK: "When the Bough... " - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE    10.13   CONTINUED:	(From now on, throughout the script, every room on Aldea	has a Teleporting Arch which allows the Aldeans to move	from place to place on their planet simply by stepping	in and identifying their destination.) Rashella, Radue	and DUANA, an older woman who is very pale and slight,	greet them.					RADUE			I hope Duana and I know how to			greet you properly, Commander.			"May your light shine through the			ages."	Radue's hand begins to shake uncontrollably.					RADUE				(continuing)			My apologies. Age has no respect			for the body.	Beverly and Troi exchange worried glances.14   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	WESLEY has joined Picard on the bridge.					WESLEY			How do they cloak the planet?					DATA			The theory is simple. The shield			bends light rays around the			planet's contour -- similar to the			Romulan cloaking device -- but the			implementation is very difficult.	A BEAM OF ENERGY PENETRATES the bridge at that moment.	It searches until it finds Wesley, then SURROUNDS him.	He can't move away from it. He closes his eyes and	relaxes into it.					PICARD			Wesley!					GEORDI			Sir, the energy beam is			originating from Aldea.					PICARD			Shields up. La Forge, contact			Commander Riker. Worf, check			all other decks.    STAR TREK: "When the Bough... " - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE    11.14   CONTINUED:					DATA			Shields inoperable, sir. All			decks are being probed in a			methodical pattern.					PICARD			All decks? Everything? The entire			ship?					DATA			Aye, sir!					GEORDI			Captain, I can't get through to			Commander Riker. We're being			blocked.	The ENERGY BEAM STOPS as suddenly as it appeared.	Wesley shakes his head, as if to brush it off.					PICARD			Are you all right, Wesley?					WESLEY				(nodding)			It was scary at first, but I			really didn't feel anything.					WORF			Sir, similar incidents, all decks,				(surprised)			but only with the children.15   INT. ALDEA - FIRST UNIT CHAMBER (OPTICAL)	The hosts are getting down to business as they all sit	around a table laden with food.					RADUE			Yes, Commander, we are an ancient			power. But we've suffered for			it. Our history is littered with			the deaths of those people who			craved more and more things.			Nothing was ever enough. So,			we've evolved a very simple way			of living: for whatever is taken,			something is given in return.					RIKER			It seems an equitable code.    STAR TREK: "When the Bough... " - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE    12.15   CONTINUED:					RADUE			It's given us peace.			Unfortunately, there are very few			of us left to enjoy it.					TROI			Why?					RADUE			That is some of what we wish to			discuss. We need help from the			Federation to rebuild our			heritage... we need a younger			generation, strong and healthy,			following in the Aldean			traditions.					RIKER			I don't understand. How can the			Federation help influence your			children in your traditions?					RADUE			Because we have no children,			Commander. Rashella was the last			child born on this planet.	Rashella watches the away team for its reaction. They're	shocked.					BEVERLY			And your medical community can			do nothing?					RASHELLA			They've tried, Doctor Crusher.			And failed.					BEVERLY			Perhaps we can help...	Troi senses something ominous and makes a signal to	Riker who quickly and correctly interprets it.					RIKER			Radue, exactly why have we been			invited to Aldea?					RADUE			We propose a trade. One which			will solve our problem and give			something back to the Federation.    STAR TREK: "When the Bough... " - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE    13.15   CONTINUED: (2)					RIKER			And the nature of this trade?					RADUE			We need some of your children.			In payment, we will give you the			kind of knowledge which would take			you centuries to acquire.16   REACTIONS	from Riker, Beverly and Troi.					RIKER			That might be acceptable to some			other races, but humans are			unusually attached to their own			offspring.17   BACK TO SHOT					RIKER			We sympathize with your situation,			Radue. But what you ask is not			possible.					RADUE			And that's your final answer?					RIKER			It's my only answer. If we can			be of help in some other way...					RADUE			I am sorry you are intransigent.	Radue nods at Rashella and touches his arm band. The	three Enterprise officers are immediately GONE from the	room.18   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Picard is surprised when the away team abruptly APPEARS	on the bridge. As Wesley turns in reaction, a BEAM	ENGULFS him and he DISAPPEARS from the bridge.	Beverly's anguished face is stunned as she reaches out	to the empty place where he was standing.					BEVERLY			Wes!    STAR TREK: "When the Bough...

He watches Harry	wander around, looking at the tapestries on the wall,	while Alexandra toddles aimlessly.					KATIE			Wesley, I'm frightened.					WESLEY			I know.

The Aldean shield			gives evidence of sporadic			fluctuations, weakening its			structure in isolated sections.					PICARD			You're saying there are holes in			their defense system?					RIKER			In essence, yes. It is surprising			after all these eons that the			Aldeans' use of their technology			is not perfect. One would assume			they would be aware of the			weakness and repair it.					PICARD			Can we beam down an away team			through one of these so-called			holes?					RIKER			It is a possibility.
