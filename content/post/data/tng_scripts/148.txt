Please... please hurry.	Pulaski moves quickly to the unconscious child, pulls	back the covers. She removes an instrument from her	smock and makes a scan of the child's body. In the	b.g., Picard enters with Riker and Data.					TROI				(continuing)			Save him, you must save him.					PULASKI			What happened? Did he eat			anything? Did he fall?					TROI			No.	Data, using his tricorder, confirms with a nod to	Riker.					DATA			The child is the source of the			unusual radiation.					TROI			He said he's the reason the ship			is in danger.					DATA			That analysis is correct.	Pulaski injects the child with hypospray.					PULASKI			I'm losing life signs.        STAR TREK: "Shades of Gray" - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR        49.89R  CONTINUED:	Troi stands by helplessly.

Pulaski stands.					PULASKI			I'm sorry.	Troi moves next to the cot on which the child is lying.	She is beyond despair. Her heart has completely	broken. The others allow her a moment alone, then as	Riker is about to move to Troi's side, a LIGHT -- the	glowing energy which we saw at the beginning -- gathers	from within the child and slowly rises. As it does,	the body that was Ian fades away until there is only	the LIGHT.89U  INTERCUT REACTIONS (OPTICAL)	Troi reaches out and with cupped hands she collects	the LIGHT, cradles it gently and brings it to her.	As she holds it close, it makes her face all aglow.	Slowly the pain and despair drain away, and through	the tears she smiles. The joy she now feels shines	from her eyes. The Betazoid within her, embraces the	essence of the entity before her and she knows now why	he came and what he wanted. Then, in an act of pure	love, she releases the glowing energy as she would a	dove. For a beat the LIGHT seems reluctant to leave.	Then it does. It passes effortlessly through the wall	of the ship and away. Troi stares after it for a beat.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE				(excited -- relieved)			Captain.

Riker realizes he	has no choice. He deftly, with no advance warning or	aggressive motion, swings a two-handed blow with his	full strength and lands a monstrous blow across the	chest of Klag.95H  SERIES OF CUTS	The sound of the blow against Klag's chest armor echoes	through the bridge and is followed by the roar of his	breath leaving his body, and then his bulk smashing	against the bulkhead and slipping to the ground.	Riker calmly steps around the still-seated captain and	steps in front of Klag who is struggling to his feet.	Klag is almost to his feet when Riker swings again,	this time taking the legs out from under Klag who drops	to the ground again.	The crewmembers are animated and watch the fight with	relish, not caring who wins or loses but that there is	combat.	Riker looks over to the captain.	Captain Kargan simply sits back and allows it to	continue.        STAR TREK: "Shades of Gray" - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR        55.95H  CONTINUED:	Riker turns back to the dazed but still active Klag who	is once more attempting to get to his feet.	Riker eyes the combatant with a calculated but	astonished eye. Klag can barely stand but bravely	fights for balance. Riker shrugs, and rams his fist	into Klag's stomach, then drops him with another	double-handed blow over the head.95I  SCENE	Kargan applauds with a grunt and a motion of his head.	Klag is awake but prone.
