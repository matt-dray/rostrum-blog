SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around a planet. The atmosphere appears	turbulent and dangerous.					PICARD (V.O.)			Captain's Log, Stardate 47423.9.			We have arrived at Boraal Two in			response to an emergency distress			call from Lieutenant Worf's foster			brother, Nikolai Rozhenko. He has			been stationed on the planet as a			cultural observer.2    INT. BRIDGE	PICARD and RIKER are at their stations; DATA is at Ops;	WORF is at Tactical; assorted N.D.s man the other	stations. The mood is serious.					PICARD			Mister Data, analysis.					DATA				(off console)			It appears the planet's atmosphere			is dissipating, sir. Intense			plasmonic reactions are destroying			it.					PICARD			How far has it progressed?					DATA			The stratosphere is already			breaking down, and there are			turbulent radiation storms across			much of the surface.				(beat)			I estimate the planet will be			uninhabitable in less than thirty-eight			hours.	Reactions to the grim news.          STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - TEASER          2.2    CONTINUED:					RIKER			The distress call was only four			days ago. Why would Doctor			Rozhenko have waited so long			before sending it?					DATA			Atmospheric dissipation is a rare			and essentially unpredictable			event. When it occurs, it			proceeds rapidly. Doctor Rozhenko			would not have had much warning.	Suddenly, the SHIP SHAKES and the LIGHTS FLICKER	momentarily.					PICARD			What was that?					DATA				(off console)			The dissipation effect is			generating plasmonic energy			bursts...					RIKER			Are they any danger to the ship?					DATA			I do not believe so. However, we			may experience intermittent system			failures and power surges as a			result.					PICARD			Keep an eye on it.	Picard turns to Worf who's busy working his console.					PICARD				(continuing)			Mister Worf. Any luck?					WORF			There is still no response to our			hails, sir... I am attempting to			scan the observation post...	Worf works his console.					RIKER				(to Picard)			He could be hurt... maybe he can't			respond...          STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - TEASER          3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			Sensor interference is			significant, but the post appears			to be intact... its power grid is			still functioning...	Worf is struggling to hide his concern.					WORF				(continuing)			However, I am reading no life			forms within the structure.	A beat.					RIKER				(to Picard)			It's hard to believe he would have			left the post...					PICARD			Especially under these			circumstances...	Meanwhile, Worf has been continuing to scan, and now he	breaks in anxiously.					WORF				(off console)			Sir, I am detecting faint power			emissions from a system of caverns			near the post. It could be a			deflector shield.	Reactions.					RIKER			It can't be native to the planet.			The Boraalans don't have anything			close to that level of technology.					WORF			Captain. Request permission to			lead an Away Team.					PICARD			Very well. But regardless of this			planet's immediate situation, we			must still observe the Prime			Directive.					(MORE)          STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - TEASER          4.2    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD (Cont'd)				(beat)			I'd like to minimize the risk of			contact with the inhabitants.			You're to go alone, Mister Worf --			and I want you surgically altered			to pass as a Boraalan.					WORF			Yes, sir.	Worf EXITS via the aft Turbolift and an N.D. moves to	take his station. Off Picard and Riker's expressions.3    INT. SICKBAY	Worf is on the clamshell bed as BEVERLY scans his head	with an OPTICAL SCANNER. A few additional MEDICAL	INSTRUMENTS are nearby.	Worf is impatient and distracted, and he's not doing a	very good job of keeping his head still; Beverly stops	scanning.					BEVERLY			Worf, you have to try to keep			still. I need an accurate scan of			your cranial anatomy...					WORF			I'm sorry, Doctor. Please			continue.	Worf composes himself, attempting to keep still;	Beverly resets the scan and begins again.					BEVERLY			You're worried about Nikolai,			aren't you?					WORF				(reluctantly)			Yes.					BEVERLY			Are the two of you close?	There is a hesitation before Worf answers.					WORF			We are... brothers.       STAR TREK: "Homeward" - REV. 10/28/93 - TEASER       5.3    CONTINUED:	But Beverly has noticed the hesitation. She keeps	taking measurements as she tries casually to draw him	out.					BEVERLY			You've never talked much about			him. What's he like?					WORF				(carefully)			Nikolai is older than I... and we			are not -- alike. We had many			disagreements as we were growing			up.					BEVERLY			That's not unusual.	Again, Worf hesitates. He's trying gingerly to	describe his brother without sounding disparaging.					WORF			Nikolai... has a mind of his own.			He attended Starfleet Academy --			but he was unable to follow the			rules. He left after one year.				(beat)			However, he has many fine			qualities. He is... brilliant.			Persuasive. A natural leader...					BEVERLY			Sounds intriguing... I look			forward to meeting him.	Worf gives her a look, but does not reply. For now,	Worf has said all he has to say on the matter.4    INT. PASSAGEWAY (OPTICAL)	A dark passageway in a cavernous underground region of	the planet. We hear the familiar hum of the	Transporter and then WORF MATERIALIZES.	We see that Worf has been surgically altered to look	like one of the Boraal (precise physical features TBD),	and is dressed in simple, loose-fitting clothes.	Worf takes out a TRICORDER and scans the area for a	beat.         STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - TEASER         5A.4    CONTINUED:					WORF				(taps combadge)			Worf to Enterprise...					RIKER'S COM VOICE				(fritzed)			Go ahead...          STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - TEASER          6.4    CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			I am picking up faint life signs			approximately two-hundred meters			from my position. I am heading			toward them.					RIKER'S COM VOICE				(fritzed)			Understood. The plasmonic			interference is getting worse...			start checking in every thirty			minutes to make sure we have a fix			on you.					WORF			Aye, sir.	Worf moves off.5    ANOTHER SECTION OF PASSAGEWAY	Worf is moving slowly and carefully, continuing to scan	with his tricorder.					VORIN (O.S.)			What are you doing here... ?	Worf reacts to the voice and quickly conceals his	tricorder. He turns to see a figure moving towards	him...6    VORIN	an adult, Boraalan male, emerges from a dark	passageway, holding an ALIEN OIL LAMP. He is dressed	in clothes similar to Worf's. A POUCH containing many	ORNATE PAPER SCROLLS is slung over his shoulder.7    RESUME SCENE	as Vorin cautiously approaches Worf.					VORIN			You're not from our village. Who			are you?	As Vorin speaks, an elderly Boraalan male, KATERAS,	emerges from the passage to join him.          STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - TEASER          7.7    CONTINUED:					KATERAS			Who is this... ?	His voice trails off as he sees Worf. This is	absolutely the last thing Worf needed, and he tries to	cover for himself.					WORF			My name is Worf. I am a...			traveller...					VORIN			How did you survive the storms?	Worf has run out of answers when a deep, strong voice	booms out of the darkness.					NIKOLAI (O.S.)			I'd recognize that voice anywhere.			Is it really you, Worf?8    NIKOLAI ROZHENKO	approaches from another direction, leading another N.D.	BORAALAN and an adult Boraalan female, DOBARA. Nikolai	is a large, powerfully-built human, but as he comes	closer, we see that his features are similar to Worf's --	Nikolai also looks like a Boraalan.9    RESUME SCENE	Nikolai moves towards Worf.					NIKOLAI			It's good to see you...				(smiles)			You've changed a lot in four			years...	Worf isn't exactly sure how to react, and he has to	stare for a moment before he recognizes who it is.					WORF			Nikolai... ?	Nikolai grins broadly and engulfs Worf in a huge bear	hug, genuinely glad to see him. Nikolai turns to the	Boraal, introducing Worf with a theatrical gesture.          STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - TEASER          8.9    CONTINUED:					NIKOLAI			This is my brother, Worf...				(beat)			He's come to help us.	OFF Worf's confused expression.                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                   STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - ACT ONE         9.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            10   INT. CAVERN	It's a larger, more open, section of the caves. Small	collections of SUPPLIES, including a few ALIEN OIL	LAMPS, are scattered throughout the area, suggesting	that the Boraalans have been here for several days.	There is a CAMPFIRE in the center, and off in a corner,	an underground spring has formed a natural POOL.	Several more N.D. BORAALANS are here, including a young	woman, TARRANA. The Boraalans all wear simple, loose-fitting	clothes. (NOTE: these people are not primitive	tribesmen. They could be thought of as similar in	development to Arabs of the late Middle Ages -- they'd	be able to build and use a telescope or a sextant, but	they might also believe in magic.)	Nikolai ENTERS leading Worf and the other Boraalans	from the passageway.					VORIN				(to Worf)			If you were able to get here, the			storms must have subsided... Do			you think it's safe enough to			return to the surface?	Worf has no idea what's going on here. He needs to	talk to Nikolai -- alone.					WORF			Please... I must speak with my			brother for a moment...	Worf quickly takes Nikolai aside so they can talk	privately. Worf keeps his voice low and controlled,	but he's clearly angry.					WORF				(continuing)			Nikolai, what have you done?					NIKOLAI			They were dying.					(MORE)         STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - ACT ONE         10.10   CONTINUED:					NIKOLAI (Cont'd)			I refused to sit there... safe in			that observation post... and watch			it happen.				(beat)			I set up a deflector shield to			screen these caves from the			radiation and then I brought them			here.					WORF			What have you told them?					NIKOLAI			They think I'm a Boraalan. I told			them I'm from another village far			from here.	Worf relaxes slightly.					WORF			At least you had that much			sense...	The two men look at each other.					NIKOLAI			I knew the Enterprise was in this			sector when I sent my distress			call... but I wasn't sure you'd be			the one to come.	He places his hand on Worf's shoulder. Nikolai is	always very physical, never afraid to show his	feelings.					NIKOLAI				(continuing)			I'm truly glad you're here, Worf.	Nikolai's words are heartfelt and Worf softens. He has	conflicting emotions: he's relieved to see his brother	alive, but he still feels Nikolai has really messed up.					WORF			There is nothing we can do for			these people. You have only			postponed their deaths.	Nikolai responds with a look of determination.					NIKOLAI			I'd like to discuss that with your			Captain.         STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - ACT ONE         11.10   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			I am certain he will want to speak			with you.	Worf and Nikolai hold each other's gaze for a beat.	Then Nikolai turns away and moves back to the group of	Boraalans.					NIKOLAI			Friends... Worf and I must return			to the surface...	The news sends a concerned murmur through the group.					NIKOLAI				(continuing)			He has equipment and provisions			and needs help to bring them here.			We'll return shortly.	Worf reacts -- surely Nikolai knows they can't come	back. Dobara seems particularly worried.					DOBARA			It's too dangerous. The storms			can occur without warning. If			you're caught in one...					NIKOLAI			Don't worry...				(beat)			My brother is a seer. He			understands the nature of the			storms. He'll know when it's safe			to travel.	Nikolai turns to Worf, looking for confirmation... and	Worf has no choice but to support him.					WORF				(reluctantly)			That is correct.	A murmur goes through the group -- they're very	impressed.					KATERAS				(in awe)			Our Seer died when the storms			first came. We have been without			his guidance for many weeks.      STAR TREK: "Homeward" - REV. 10/29/93 - ACT ONE      12.10   CONTINUED: (3)	Worf reacts -- the attention is making him	uncomfortable.					VORIN				(to Worf and Nikolai)			Let me go with you. I know the			terrain better than anyone, and I			can help--					NIKOLAI			No, Vorin. Worf and I will be			fine. We'll be back soon.	OFF Nikolai and Worf's expressions.11   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	in orbit around Boraal Two.12   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Picard, Riker, TROI, Beverly, Worf, and Nikolai. Worf	and Nikolai are back to normal: since their return to	the ship, their Boraalan get-up has been removed.	Nikolai is on his feet, pacing -- he's vital and	energetic, a man with a mission trying to persuade	others.      STAR TREK: "Homeward" - REV. 10/29/93 - ACT ONE      13.12   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Doctor, you were fully aware that			the atmospheric dissipation could			not be stopped. What were you			hoping to accomplish by assisting			these people?					NIKOLAI			I was trying to give them a			future.				(beat)			I propose we create an atmospheric			shield on the planet. We can			camouflage the equipment just like			my observation post. No one will			ever know it's there.	Astonished reactions around the table.					RIKER			You can't be serious.					NIKOLAI			I realize it would only provide			atmosphere for a limited area of			the surface. But it would be			enough to save one village.					PICARD			I have no intention of compounding			what you've already done by			committing another gross violation			of the Prime Directive.					NIKOLAI			The Boraalans have a rich and			beautiful culture... a deep			spiritual life. They deserve the			chance to survive.	It's hard not to be moved by Nikolai's passion.					NIKOLAI			Isn't that what the Prime			Directive was truly intended to			do... allow cultures to survive			and grow naturally?					TROI			Not entirely. The Prime Directive			was designed to ensure non-interference.      STAR TREK: "Homeward" - REV. 10/29/93 - ACT ONE      14.12   CONTINUED: (2)	Beverly is feeling a little conflicted -- she wishes	they could do something.					BEVERLY			But aren't we intefering either			way? If we take no action, it's			a conscious decision to let the			Boraalans die.	Nikolai seizes on this.					NIKOLAI			Exactly.				(beat)			We have the power to save some of			them... all we have to do is			exercise it.	But Picard is not persuaded.					PICARD			The Prime Directive is a principle			we've all sworn to uphold. Until			that is changed, we cannot follow			any other course of action. Is			that understood?	There's a long beat as Nikolai struggles to control his	emotions. Finally, he acquiesces.					NIKOLAI			There are several log recorders in			my observation post... They			contain most of my research.			Since it appears that the only way			I'll be able to preserve Boraalan			culture is in a museum, I would			like permission to return to the			surface and retrieve them.	Picard doesn't want to make this any harder on Nikolai	that it already is, but Nikolai's ploy is transparent.					PICARD			I'm afraid that won't be possible.			You may have full use of the			ship's computers to set up a com			link and upload your data from			here.	Nikolai nods silently. Picard looks around the somber	table.         STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - ACT ONE         15.12   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD				(continuing)			If there's nothing further, you're			dismissed.	The meeting breaks up. Everyone files out except	Nikolai who continues to sit, staring off into space.	Worf approaches him, trying to help.					WORF				(gently)			Nikolai... I am sorry. I wish			there were another way.	Nikolai doesn't respond; his expression is unreadable.					WORF				(continuing, presses on)			I am quite familiar with our			communications systems. If you			wish, I will help you set up your			com link.					NIKOLAI			No. I'll do it myself.	Then Nikolai abruptly gets up and EXITS. OFF Worf's	expression.13   INT.

Dobara looks at Worf a bit fearfully,	uncertain if the two are going to fight again.					NIKOLAI			Dobara... go inside.					DOBARA			Nikolai -- don't...          STAR TREK: "Homeward" - REV. 11/01/93 - ACT FIVE         56A.67   CONTINUED:					NIKOLAI			Please.	She gives Worf a last look and then enters the tent.					NIKOLAI			I told you -- you'll have to kill			me to get me away from here.	Worf regards his brother for a long beat.             STAR TREK: "Homeward" - 10/27/93 - ACT FIVE            57.67   CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			I don't want to fight you,			Nikolai.	These are two men trying to reach each other, trying to	find the way out of conflict and into resolution.	Nikolai takes a breath, tries to cut through.					NIKOLAI			Nothing was ever easy between us,			was it?					WORF			No.	Nikolai is trying to set things right between them --	even if it means making difficult admissions.					NIKOLAI			It's my fault. If I'd been more			like you, we wouldn't have had so			many problems.	Worf is touched by the gesture.					WORF			If you'd been more like me --			those people would not be here			now. You gave them a chance at a			new life.	Nikolai regards him... takes the next step.          STAR TREK: "Homeward" - REV. 11/01/93 - ACT FIVE          58.67   CONTINUED: (3)					NIKOLAI			Worf... I intend to share that			life with them. The village will			need someone to begin a new			chronicle... and my child will			need a father. My place is here.				(beat: a small smile)			Don't you see? I'm finally taking			responsibility.	Worf hesitates, then smiles as well.					WORF			You were never good at drawing...			how will you keep a chronicle?	Nikolai smiles -- they've reached a resolution.					NIKOLAI			I learn quickly.					WORF			Then perhaps there is hope...	Worf moves closer to Nikolai and picks up Vorin's pouch	of scrolls which lies nearby. He searches through the	pouch for a beat and then finds the one he was looking	for. Worf unrolls it -- it's the drawing Vorin made of	Worf and Nikolai.					WORF				(continuing)			May I take this with me?					NIKOLAI			It's yours.	A long beat as the two brothers share the personal	moment.					WORF			I will attempt to explain all this			to mother and father.					NIKOLAI			They won't understand.					WORF			They may.
