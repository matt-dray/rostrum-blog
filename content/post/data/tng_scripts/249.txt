RIKER and SEVERAL CREWMEMBERS ENTER from	the fore and aft Turbolifts. It's time to change	shifts and while Riker moves to Data, the other members	of Riker's shift take over their positions from the	people on Data's shift. No one moves to relieve the	N.D. Ensign standing at Tactical.					DATA			Good morning, Commander.					RIKER			Data. Interesting night?					DATA			I found it extremely interesting.			The lateral sensor array performed			three separate spectral analyses			of the Alwanir Nebula on three			distinct frequencies.					RIKER			Sorry I missed it.					DATA				(missing the ironic				 tone)			I will have the reports sent to			you.				(begins making report)			We are still on course for the			Gariman system, our speed is warp			six and our ETA is thirteen			hundred hours.

The Ensign is	still standing there, waiting awkwardly.					RIKER				(to Data)			Isn't Worf supposed to relieve			Ensign Torigan?					DATA			Yes, sir.

CORRIDOR	Riker and TWO N.D. SECURITY CREWMEMBERS move down the	Corridor and come to a stop outside Worf's Quarters.	The Security Officers take up positions on either side	of Riker as he reaches for the door panel. He presses	it... no response.       STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - 03/08/93 - TEASER       3.3    CONTINUED:					RIKER				(to com)			Computer, override the security			lock on this door.

WORF'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS	As Riker and the two officers ENTER the room. The room	is filled with acrid smoke and is lit only with dimly	seen ceremonial candles. They look about for a moment,	trying to peer through the gloom. Suddenly, they are	startled by a throaty ROAR out of the darkness.					WORF'S VOICE			TORVA LUK DO SHELL!5    NEW ANGLE	Revealing WORF sitting cross-legged on the deck in his	bedroom. He is wearing some kind of Klingon ceremonial	robe and he is staring into a small FIRE which is	blazing in a stone firepit that is sitting in the	center of the bedroom. The look on his face is feral,	intense... Klingon. This, combined with the red light	of the fire, the smoke, and the dark shadows make this	an almost satanic, other-worldly scene.	There is a beat, and then Worf lifts his eyes from the	fire and sees Riker... his mouth twists into a snarl.					RIKER				(shocked)			Worf?				(beat)			What the hell are you doing?	Worf suddenly comes back to the here and now and the	snarl on his face gives way to sudden realization...	and surprise.

READY ROOM	Riker and PICARD are sitting at the desk.					PICARD			He had no explanation at all?					RIKER			Not a word. He just got dressed			and then reported for duty as if			nothing had happened.				(beat)			Captain, this isn't the first...			problem I've had with Worf lately.					PICARD				(surprised)			Oh?					RIKER			Until now, it wasn't anything			serious so I didn't bring it to			your attention. But, to be blunt,			he's been getting... sloppy. His			duty reports have been incomplete,			he's fallen behind in maintenance			checks, he just seems...			distracted.	Picard thinks for a moment.					PICARD			Where's Worf now?					RIKER			I confined him to quarters.	Picard thinks for a another beat, then stands and heads	for the door.					PICARD			You have the Bridge, Number One.       STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE       5.7    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Aye, sir.	They both EXIT.                                             CUT TO:8    INT. WORF'S QUARTERS	The smoke is gone, the normal lights are on, and the	fire has been put out. Worf is lying on his bed,	staring up at the ceiling. The door CHIMES. He hears	it, but he seems listless, almost apathetic. The door	CHIMES a second time.					WORF			Enter.9    ANGLE ON DOOR	As Picard ENTERS. He looks around the room... the	ritual candles, lava rocks, and remnants of the fire	pit are all still in evidence. The room is a mess,	with Klingon implements and clothes lying all over the	place. Picard carefully picks his way through the	detritus and moves toward the bedroom.	When Worf sees that it's Picard, he moves to a sitting	position on the bed.					WORF			Captain.	Picard notes the untidy room and Worf's indifferent	attitude. He decides to give him a wake-up call.					PICARD				(hard)			On your feet, Lieutenant.	Worf's head snaps up at the tone in Picard's voice and	he stands stiffly.					WORF			Sir.       STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE       6.9    CONTINUED:					PICARD				(firm)			Mister Worf, your personal affairs			are strictly your concern unless			they interfere with the operation			of this ship. You've crossed that			line. Now as your Captain, I want			to know exactly what's going on.	Worf looks at him for a moment... and then responds	both to the sound of command and the note of compassion	in Picard's voice.					WORF			It is... difficult to explain.					PICARD			Try.	Worf nods after a beat and seems to accept the need to	get this out into the open. He moves about the room,	wrestling with some inner turmoil.					WORF			Ever since I returned from the			Carraya system I have felt...			empty...	Picard reacts to the mention of the Carraya system. He	remembers Worf's reluctance to talk about this and he	is careful not to push him too far.					PICARD			Does this have something to do			with the Klingons you... rescued			from Carraya Four?					WORF				(nods)			They were young... they knew			nothing of their heritage. So			while I was there, I tried to...			teach them... teach them about			their people, their culture.	A passion and fire comes into Worf's eyes and in his	movements that was missing only a moment ago as he	remembers his experiences.       STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE       7.9    CONTINUED: (2)					WORF			I told them our ancient stories...			instructed them in our customs...			explained our beliefs. And then			I told them about Kahless... how			he united our people long ago...			how he gave us honor and			strength... and how he promised to			return one day and lead us again.				(beat)			It took time... but I saw them			begin to discover the warriors			within themselves... to believe in			Kahless and his teachings... and			to become truly Klingon. It was			... unlike anything I had			experienced before.	Picard looks down at the rocks and debris scattered	around the room.					PICARD			Is that what you were doing here?			Trying to recapture those			feelings?					WORF				(nods)			I was trying to summon a vision of			Kahless.					PICARD				(lightly)			You might have tried using the			Holodeck instead of setting your			quarters on fire.					WORF			Using the Holodeck would not be			appropriate... everything had to			be real if Kahless were to appear.				(defeated)			But all this was for nothing... he			did not come to me.	He moves to a small Klingon statue sitting prominently	on a shelf and looks at it.					WORF			I gave Toq and the others a belief			in Sto-Vo-Kor: the life which			lies beyond this life... where			Kahless awaits us.				(MORE)       STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE       8.9    CONTINUED: (3)					WORF (Cont'd)				(beat)			When I saw the power of their			belief...

I am not sure I ever			had a true belief.	Worf looks at Picard... feels guilty about the way he's	been acting.					WORF			But I should not have allowed it			to interfere with my duties. My			behavior has been --					PICARD			Inexcusable.				(beat)			But understandable. You are the			only Klingon in Starfleet... and			one of the few raised by human			parents. Perhaps the problem is			that you have only studied the			beliefs of your people... only			looked at them from the outside.	Picard moves around the room for a moment.					PICARD			It may be that what you seek			cannot be found on the Enterprise.			You may need to immerse yourself			in Klingon beliefs before you can			discover whether they hold any			truths for you.				(beat)			Is there anything you could do...			any place you could go... to			explore your faith more fully?	Worf thinks for a moment.       STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE       9.9    CONTINUED: (4)					WORF			Boreth.

LAVA CAVE	Worf is sitting cross-legged on the floor of the cave	along with SEVERAL N.D. KLINGONS including one named	TORIN. All are dressed in ceremonial robes and are	sitting around a smoking fire pit with their eyes	closed. There are candles and Klingon artifacts in	evidence with smoke drifting throughout the cave. The	heat is intense and the scene should look like an	expanded and more traditional version of the scene in	Worf's Quarters in the Teaser. They've all been here	for several hours.	They all open their eyes and stare into the flames.	One Klingon takes a small pail and pours some water on	the flames, which then crackle and sizzle, sending out	even more smoke. Suddenly, one young Klingon -- DIVOK --	looks up and reacts to something.					DIVOK			Kahless! I see Kahless!	The others all look at him with pleasure except Worf,	who is disappointed that he is not the one receiving	the vision. Another Klingon, this one much older --	KOROTH -- the Head Cleric in charge of this place, nods	in satisfaction. He is an older man, his hair mostly	gray at this point, he is lean and trim -- a man whose	life is uncluttered by indulgence of any kind. He	wears a ceremonial garment that is part priestly	vestment, part battle armor.	Divok continues to watch something which only he can	see. His face is drenched with sweat and he seems on	the verge of total exhaustion.					DIVOK			He is standing before me...			holding a sword... he wants			something... me, he wants me! He			wants me to go with him!	Divok gets to his feet and starts to move toward the	unseen vision. Worf and the others have to catch him	before he falls into the fire. Divok practically	collapses into Worf's arms, his energy totally spent.    STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - REV. 03/11/93 - ACT ONE    11.12   CONTINUED:					KOROTH			It is a powerful vision you have			had, Divok. Kahless has asked you			to join him in Sto-Vo-Kor. You			are only nineteen and yet your			place among the honored dead is			already secure	Koroth motions to the others.					KOROTH			Take him back to his chamber. Let			him sleep.	Divok lets the others help him up some crude steps and	out of the cave. Everyone EXITS except Worf. He	remains standing near the fire pit, with defeat written	on his face. After a beat, Worf dowses the fire with	water and it goes OUT.                                             CUT TO:13   INT. WORF'S CHAMBERS	A small, spartan room with a single hard bed, a bench	and a crude chest. The building and furnishings are	obviously quite old. It should look like a monk's room	at a monastery. Worf is taking some personal items	from the chest and packing them in his haversack. He	is facing away from the open doorway when Koroth	ENTERS.					KOROTH			You are leaving us.					WORF				(without turning around)			It has been ten days, Koroth. But			I have had no visions... I have			received no insight.				(beat)			There is nothing for me here.	Koroth takes a few steps in the small room.    STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - REV. 03/15/93 - ACT ONE    12.13   CONTINUED:					KOROTH			What is the story of The Promise,			Worf?	Worf says nothing for a beat.					WORF			When Kahless united the people and			gave them the laws of honor, he			saw that his work was done. So			one night he gathered his			belongings and went to the edge of			the city to say good-bye.					KOROTH				(picking up the thread				 of the story)			The people wept... they did not			want him to go.					WORF			And Kahless said, "You are			Klingons. You need no one but			yourselves. I will go now... to			Sto-Vo-Kor. But I promise one day			I will return." Then Kahless			pointed to a star in the sky and			said, "Look for me there... on			that point of light."	Koroth opens his arms and indicates the entire room.					KOROTH			So here we are... on a world			circling that distant point of			light. It has been over fifteen			centuries since he made that			promise... and still we wait.				(beat)			What are ten days in the life of			one Klingon compared to that? Is			the son of Mogh really so easily			discouraged?    STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - REV. 03/15/93 - ACT ONE    13.13   CONTINUED: (2)	Koroth turns away from Worf and moves a few steps away.					KOROTH			You came to us seeking answers...			but this is a place of questions.			Open your heart to Kahless... ask			him your questions... let him			speak to you with your mind			unclouded by doubt or hesitation.			Only then can you find what you			are looking for.				(beat)			If you cannot do that... then			perhaps you should return to your			starship.	Koroth EXITS.

TEMPLE	The Temple is more like a war room than a church.	There are weapons on display everywhere, proud banners	and emblems adorn the walls and the room is dominated	at one end by a single ornate chair sitting on a raised	platform. There is a bat'leth sword on the chair.	There are a few spartan benches in the room.    STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - REV. 03/15/93 - ACT ONE    14.14   CONTINUED:	Worf ENTERS from a doorway and walks through the	temple. No other Klingons are in sight and the Temple	is completely still... only the low sound of the wind	outside can be heard. He approaches a LARGE PAINTING	on the wall.15   ON PAINTING	It is a heroic rendering of Kahless standing alone. He	is dressed in a distinctive garment that is very	different from the normal Klingon battledress.

OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Gowron and Koroth are both trying to browbeat Picard	into agreeing to their requests while Kahless sits at	the table in silence... a man watching others argue	over his fate. TWO N.D. SECURITY GUARDS stand watch	in the b.g.					GOWRON				(re: Kahless)			I will not allow the Enterprise to			enter Klingon space with him on			board.					KOROTH				(to Picard)			The Klingon High Council asked you			to bring Kahless to the Home			World. Only they can withdraw the			request. The Enterprise must			continue on its mission.					GOWRON			There is no mission, Koroth...			your plan has failed.					KOROTH			I will enjoy watching the life			bleed from your veins.					PICARD			Gentlemen, please. Let us stick			to the issue at--	Worf ENTERS the room. He moves to Kahless and the two	men share a silent look for a moment.					PICARD			Mister Worf?          STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - 03/08/93 - ACT FIVE          61.59   CONTINUED:					WORF			Captain, will you excuse us for a			moment?	Beat.					PICARD			Of course.	Picard stands and indicates for the Guards to follow	him. They all EXIT. Once they're gone, everyone looks	to Worf to see what he will do. After a beat, Worf	moves to Gowron.					WORF			The man that appeared to me on			Boreth is not the real Kahless.			He is a clone.					GOWRON			A clone!					WORF			Yes.	Koroth looks bitter and disappointed. Gowron looks at	him in triumph.					GOWRON				(to Koroth)			Did you really think you would get			away with this kind of fraud?

They			need Kahless.					GOWRON			But when they find out the			truth... ?					WORF			It will not matter. Despite the			facts, they will still believe...			They will... make a leap of			faith... and there will be others			just like them... not everyone...			but enough to plunge the Empire			into civil war if you oppose them.					GOWRON			What are you saying? That I			should just... hand over the			Empire?					WORF			No... that would be unwise as			well.					KOROTH			Then what are you proposing, Worf?	Worf moves to Kahless and looks at him.          STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - 03/08/93 - ACT FIVE          63.59   CONTINUED: (3)					WORF			You were right about one thing,			Koroth... our people are becoming			corrupt and decadent... they need			moral leadership. Kahless can be			that leader... as Emperor.					GOWRON				(outraged)			There hasn't been an Emperor in			three centuries!					WORF			The political power would remain			with the High Council. Kahless			would be... a figurehead. But he			would have the ability to rally			the people... to lead by			example... and guide them in			spiritual matters.					KOROTH			The title is meaningless without			the power to back it up.	Worf ignores him and addresses Kahless directly.					WORF			Real power is in the heart. You			would have the power to mold the			Klingon heart... you could return			them to honorable ways...			according to the original			teachings of Kahless, which are			within you... it would be a great			challenge, if you have the courage			to accept it.					GOWRON			And what will we tell the people			about their new Emperor? That he			appeared in a cave or a			laboratory?					WORF			We will tell them the truth... all			of the truth. But we will also			tell them that even if he is not			the real Kahless... he is the			rightful heir to Kahless.					GOWRON			And if I refuse to go along with			this?          STAR TREK: "Rightful Heir" - 03/08/93 - ACT FIVE          64.59   CONTINUED: (4)					WORF			Then my brother and all who			support him on the Council will			fight you... and I will fight			you... and the Empire will fall			back into civil war.	Gowron considers that for a moment... finally turns to	Koroth.					GOWRON			What do you say to this, Koroth?	Koroth thinks for a moment... then turns to Kahless					KOROTH			What I say is unimportant. What			do you say?	Kahless and Worf exchange a long look... then Kahless	finds some strength deep down within himself and he	rises up out of the chair, regal and proud.					KAHLESS			It is acceptable.	Koroth drops to one knee. Worf looks at Gowron, then	Worf goes down on one knee.					KAHLESS			Join with me, Gowron. Let us			usher in this new era together.	Gowron takes a beat, looks at Kahless, then finally	bends his knee as well.					GOWRON				(softly)			Vorcha-doh-baghK...

Kahless takes a beat and then reaches deep	down inside... and when he speaks it is the first	inkling of what this man can one day become for his	people... a true leader.					KAHLESS			Kahless left us -- all of us -- a			powerful legacy... a way of			thinking and acting that makes us			Klingon.
