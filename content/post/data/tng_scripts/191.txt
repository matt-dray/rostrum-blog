Brattain. The missing			science vessel failed to arrive			at its destination and has not			been heard from since a distress			call twenty-nine days ago.2    INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, TROI at their stations;	ENSIGN RAGER at Conn. On the viewscreen at a	distance, a space craft floats adrift.					PICARD			Magnify.	The craft springs into the foreground.					RIKER			It's the Brattain, all right.     STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 1/11/91 - TEASER     2.2    CONTINUED:					DATA			The ship is intact, sir, with no			indications of structural damage.					RIKER			Engines?					DATA			All propulsion systems are shut			down.

I need to go, also...	Riker looks at her... need to go? Then he nods at her,	and he, Data, and Worf head for the turbolift. Troi	stares out at the drifting space craft for a second,	troubled, as though hearing some unuttered thought.	Then she turns and follows the others toward the	turbolift.3    PICARD	notes her strange demeanor.4    INT. BRATTAIN - BRIDGE - MINUTES LATER (OPTICAL))	The small Bridge is, on first sight, empty. BEVERLY,	Riker, Worf, Data, and Troi MATERIALIZE at the rear	of the Bridge. They look around the quiet room,	getting their bearings. Data heads for a computer	station, keys information.					DATA			There is no indication of			malfunction in any of the main			systems.	Riker moves toward the Command Chairs. The Captain's	seat has a high back which, as he turns it, reveals	--5    CAPTAIN ZAHEVA	The woman is dead, eyes frozen open in a horrified	stare. Camera PANS down to reveal a long tool	plunged straight into her heart.6    ON THE GROUP	as Riker, Troi, and Data react to this grim discovery.					WORF (V.O.)			Here's another one.	They turn to see that --     STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 12/20/90 - TEASER     4.7    WORF	has found a second body, underneath a computer console,	huddled tight to the wall as if in terror. Worf tugs	the corpse out and it tumbles onto the deck, face and	chest charred black.					WORF			This was done by a phaser... at			a setting of six or seven...					RIKER			There are more over here...	Now the team realizes that the seemingly empty Bridge	is a tomb, with bodies having taken refuge under	consoles, seats, etc.					BEVERLY			The entire Bridge crew...					RIKER			Whoever did this... may still be			on board.					TROI			There's someone alive... but he			didn't kill these people...	She moves toward the turbolift, as though drawn by an	unseen thread.					TROI			Here...	She nears it and the turbolift door opens.8    A MAN	HAGAN sits cross-legged on the floor of the turbolift,	staring straight ahead. Beverly moves toward him,	scans him. Riker and Worf, taking no chances, keep	their phasers on him.					BEVERLY			He's alive...					TROI			I think he is Betazoid...	She knees down close to him, trying to make contact.     STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 12/17/90 - TEASER     5.8    CONTINUED:					TROI			It's all right. We're going to			help you.	The man offers one soft, shuddering intake of air...	but no more.9    TROI	holds his shoulders, looking into his eyes.					TROI			What happened here? Who did this			to you?	But there is no answer. The man stares past them, lost	in a catatonic void.									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                               STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 1/2/91 - ACT ONE     6.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:10   INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - SOME TIME LATER	Picard watches with Beverly as a SUPERNUMERARY wheels	away a form in a body bag.					BEVERLY			We're almost finished with the			autopsies, Captain.					PICARD			How long will it take you to			compile the data?					BEVERLY			It's complicated -- the dead were			found everywhere... some locked			in their rooms -- barricaded, with			weapons piled around them... some			in corridors where they'd			obviously had hand-to-hand			combat... I'll have to sort			through and analyze the details.	Picard glances toward a bio-bed, where Troi sits with	the Betazoid man.					BEVERLY			We've identified him as Andrus			Hagan, from Betazed, science			advisor. He's in a profound			catatonic state.	Picard walks toward Troi.					TROI			I'm not getting much, Captain...			a few words, disconnected phrases.			I can feel his terror... but I			can't seem to reach him.					PICARD			Don't give up on him, Counselor.			We're examining the Brattain for			clues -- but this man is the only			one left who knows what happened			there.	Picard turns and EXITS, and Troi turns back to Hagan.	She is trying to engage his mind telepathically.     STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 1/9/91 - ACT ONE     7.10   CONTINUED:					TROI (V.O.)			I'm here. I'm right here.			There's nothing to be afraid of			anymore.					HAGAN (V.O.)			... out there... voices...					TROI (V.O.)			You hear voices?

SPACE - BRATTAIN (OPTICAL)	The small ship hangs in space.13   INT. BRATTAIN - BRIDGE	Data and Riker at the computers. GEORDI ENTERS from	the turbolift.     STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 1/9/91 - ACT ONE     8.13   CONTINUED:					GEORDI			All engines check out perfectly,			Commander. Once we get them			started up, the Brattain can get			back to Starbase under her own			power.					RIKER			Let's give it a try.	Geordi takes his place at a science station near Data.					GEORDI			Pre-heating injectors... Data,			fuel flow?					DATA			Matter valves are open and			operating.

The door CHIMES.					PICARD			Come.	Beverly ENTERS carrying a Padd.					BEVERLY			I've been studying the autopsy			reports... the conclusion is			appalling.	Picard gives her a look -- strong words from this	dispassionate scientist.					BEVERLY			There was no outside source...			no alien presence... The crew of			the Brattain, all thirty-four of			them -- appear to have killed each			other.	Picard is taken aback by this conclusion.					PICARD			What could have caused such an			event? Drugs? A virus?			Poison...					BEVERLY			Toxicological tests showed no			unusual substances in their			systems. And they were in good			health.					(MORE)    STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 12/19/90 - ACT ONE    10.14   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY (Cont'd)				(beat)			But for whatever reason, they seem			to have turned against each other,			using phasers, knives -- and bare			hands.	Beverly programs information into the Captain's	computer.					BEVERLY			I'd like you to see this, Captain.			It's from the logs of the			Brattain. Captain Zaheva's mental			condition deteriorated steadily			after they became stranded... she			began talking of plots and			mutinies...	She activates the computer.					BEVERLY			This is the last entry... made			after they had been adrift for			over three weeks.	They turn toward the monitor.15   ANGLE - MONITOR - INTERCUTTING (OPTICAL)	Captain Zaheva, sitting in the same chair where she	was found, is a wreck... eyes red-rimmed, voice hoarse,	endlessly brushing the side of her head in a compulsive	gesture.					CAPTAIN ZAHEVA			First Officer Brink and his men			were behind it... they got to the			engines... don't work anymore...			had to eliminate Brink... the			ship is out of... out of... we're			running out... too dangerous...			out of Brink... and his men...	Her eyes flick upward, there is a brief moment of	terror, and then the screen goes blank. Mystery upon	mystery. Picard stares at Beverly, perplexed, mind	churning to understand what happened on the stricken	science vessel.     STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT ONE     11.16   INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SICKBAY	Troi is leaving Sickbay, speaks to a SUPERNUMERARY.	(PRODUCTION NOTE: This is the beginning of the dream	sequence, but should seem perfectly normal.)					TROI			Be sure to call me if there's any			change in his condition. I'll			be in my office.	She turns and proceeds down the corridor. She passes	a turbolift; the door opens and several CREW MEMBERS	spill out, going their way. She smiles, greeting them,	and passes through the bustling activity. DOLLY with	her as she proceeds down the corridor to --17   TROI'S OFFICE DOOR	As it opens, she ENTERS.18   INT. NIGHTMARE ROOM (OPTICAL)	Suddenly Troi steps into a bizarre surreality. She	spins to find the door she entered. It is gone. She	turns back to see she is in...19   A MURKY VOID (OPTICAL)	A strange, empty cavity where everything is fuzzy,	smoky, gaseous. Vague shapes seem to loom in the	distance but have no substance. At a great distance,	there are two pinpoints of light... the mists swirl	in front of them, obscuring them. A RUSTLING SOUND,	maybe wind, maybe a cry, seems to come from within the	shadowy depths. It is an ominous, menacing sound,	suggesting a demon lurking in the mists. Troi finds	herself floating... drifting helplessly in the clouds.	It is frightening to be so out of control.					TROI			Where are you?	She reaches out both arms in front of her, fearful,	like a sightless person feeling her way through	unfamiliar territory. The rustling SOUND becomes a	low, throaty voice... sighing, raspy, foreboding.     STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT ONE     12.20   ANOTHER ANGLE ON TROI (OPTICAL)	as she is drawn toward the sinister sound, unable to	resist. She drifts further into the vaporous	landscape, seeking the source. But she cannot control	her direction.					TROI			I'm coming. Where are you?	Struggling forward, Troi tries to free herself. The	throaty sound becomes louder... takes shape...					SIGHING VOICE			Eyes... in the dark... one moon...			circles...	Troi is swimming in space, frantically trying to move	forward as the voice becomes louder...					SIGHING VOICE			See the eyes... in the dark...			one moon...					TROI			Where are you?!21   INT. ENTERPRISE - TROI'S QUARTERS	Troi, in her bed, sits up with a start.

As he does, we begin to hear a SOUND...	a hollow, deadened CLUNG... as though something were	hitting a pipe somewhere far below.    STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 12/17/90 - ACT TWO    14.24   CONTINUED:	It hits once, twice... only now does Peeples seem to	hear it. He lifts his head, straining to hear better.	The sound increases in volume, and he stands in alarm.					PEEPLES			Someone's still here...	The sound gets louder still, a chilling, insistent cry.	Peeples looks panicked.					PEEPLES			They're alive!25   ANGLE - GEORDI AND PEEPLES	As soon as Geordi is included in the shot, the SOUND	disappears. Geordi is staring at the Ensign.					GEORDI			Ensign... what is it?26   ON PEEPLES	Now, the sound is loud and clear.					PEEPLES			Can't you hear it? There's			someone left alive on the ship!27   ANGLE - GEORDI AND PEEPLES	Geordi's stare catches Peeples' attention, and then	he realizes he's not hearing anything.					PEEPLES			I heard... I mean, I thought I			heard something.					GEORDI			The ship was searched thoroughly.			There's no one left aboard.	Geordi's look of concern embarrasses the young Ensign.					PEEPLES			Sorry, sir. My mistake.     STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT TWO     15.27   CONTINUED:					GEORDI				(gently)			Thirty-four people were found dead			on this ship.

Presently	the door opens and Keiko comes bustling in, happy to	see him.     STAR TREK: "Night Terrors" - REV. 1/4/91 - ACT TWO     16.29   CONTINUED:					KEIKO			Boy, what a day this was...
