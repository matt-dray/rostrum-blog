Looks	at her --					PICARD			Counselor, it is not a child.			It is an invention, albeit an			extraordinary one.					TROI			Why should biology or technology			determine whether it is a child?			I see a man who has created an			offspring... a new life out of			his own being. That suggests a			child to me. If Data wishes to			call Lal his child, who are we to			argue?					PICARD				(frowns)			If he must, fine. But I don't			understand how he can call a five			foot android, with heuristic			learning systems and the strength			of a ten men a "child".					TROI			You've never been a parent.	Picard does a take as they turn a corner.5    INT. READY ROOM	Data sits on the sofa... pull back to reveal Picard.					PICARD			Data, what you have done has very			serious ramifications and I am			dismayed that you did not inform			anyone of what you were doing.      STAR TREK: "Offspring" - REV. 12/22/89 - ACT ONE      8.5    CONTINUED:					DATA			I am sorry I did not anticipate			your objections, Captain. Do you			wish me to deactivate Lal?					PICARD			It is a life, Data. It cannot			be activated or de-activated			simply. It is a stupendous			undertaking. Have you any idea			what will happen when Starfleet			learns of this?					DATA			I have followed all Starfleet			regulations to the best of my			ability, Captain... I expected			they would be pleased...					PICARD			We'll see.				(beat)			My foremost concern is for the			safety of this ship and crew.			You are faster, stronger, and far			more knowledgeable than any			human...					DATA			I can assure you Lal's programming			includes psychological inhibitor			safeguards to prevent any threat			to the Enterprise.      STAR TREK: "Offspring" - REV. 12/22/89 - ACT ONE      9.5    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			And in the event of a malfunction?					DATA			A malfunction is of course a			possibility, Captain.

There seems to be much			confusion on the issue. One			traditional doctrine insists			"spare the rod and spoil the			child", suggesting a punitive			approach... another more liberal			attitude would allow a child			enormous freedom...					PICARD				(trying to interrupt)			Data...					DATA			And what the Klingons do to their			children...					PICARD				(interrupting)			I'm not talking about parenting.				(beat)			I'm talking about the			extraordinary consequences of			creating new life.					DATA				(confused)			Does that not describe becoming			a parent, sir?	Not wanting to get into this --      STAR TREK: "Offspring" - REV. 12/28/89 - ACT ONE      10.5    CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			You are seeking to achieve what			no one, other than your own			creator, has been able to achieve			-- to make another sentient,			functional android. To make			another Data.					DATA			That is why I must attempt this,			Captain. I have observed that			in most species, there is a primal			instinct to perpetuate themselves.			And while I have not been			programmed with instinctive			behavior patterns, I do understand			that I have been, until now, the			last of my kind. If I were damaged			or destroyed, I would be lost			forever. But if I am successful			with the creation of Lal, my			continuance is assured. I believe			I understand the consequences.

We've got			quite a facility at Galor Four.			I'd like to show it to you.					PICARD			The Admiral is in fact suggesting			you be moved to Galor Four, Lal.					LAL			Have I done something wrong?					ADMIRAL HAFTEL			Not at all. But it is important			to broaden your experiences. And			there's just so much you can learn			aboard a starship, wouldn't you			agree?					LAL			Yes, I'd agree.					ADMIRAL HAFTEL			Good.					LAL			Thus, the natural conclusion would			be when I have learned all there			is to learn aboard the starship,			I would relocate to Galor Four.          STAR TREK: "Offspring" - REV. 12/20/89 - ACT FOUR         48.45A  CONTINUED:					ADMIRAL HAFTEL			I don't agree. That is not the			natural conclusion here.					LAL			I believe it is.	Turning to Picard as though she were not in the room.					ADMIRAL HAFTEL			You see, she resists alternative			suggestions to her own father's			wishes. That's not a good sign.					LAL			Excuse me, sir, I do not know my			father's wishes.					ADMIRAL HAFTEL			He did not "warn" you about this			conversation?					LAL			Warn me? No, Admiral.

But I have decided I must			ask you to release her to me.					DATA			May I know why, sir?					ADMIRAL HAFTEL			All the other arguments aside,			there is one that is irrefutable.			There are only two Soong-type			androids in existence. It is far			too dangerous to have the two of			you in one place. Especially on			a starship. One lucky shot by			some Romulan and we lose you both.					PICARD			That's a fine argument, Admiral.			But it doesn't change my feeling			that the proper place for Lal to			develop is by Data's side.					ADMIRAL HAFTEL			You're not a parent, Captain.			I am. I've learned, with			difficulty, that there's a time			when...				(including himself with				 Data)			... all parents have to let go of			our children... for their own			good.          STAR TREK: "Offspring" - REV. 12/21/89 - ACT FIVE         53.48C  CONTINUED:					PICARD			This is not that time.

I wanted to give			something back in return for all			Starfleet has given me. I still			do. But Lal is my child. You			ask that I volunteer to give her			up. I cannot. That would			violate every lesson I have			learned about human parenting.				(beat)			As Captain Picard told me after			he first met her, I have taken			on "quite a responsibility." I			have brought a new life into this			world. It is my duty, not			Starfleet's, to guide her through			these first difficult steps to			maturity, to support her as she			learns, to prepare her to be a			contributing member of society.			No one can relieve me of that			obligation. And I cannot ignore			it.
