SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	traveling at warp speed through the black silk of	space.2    INT. MAIN BRIDGE	DATA is at Ops and WORF at Tactical. RIKER stands	behind ENSIGN GIBSON at Conn. PICARD sits at his	Command Station.					RIKER			Captain, we are approaching			Klavdia Three.					PICARD			Take us to impulse power.					GIBSON			Aye, sir. Impulse power.2A   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as the Enterprise comes out of warp.2B   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING	GEORDI is at his position. WESLEY CRUSHER is nearby.					GEORDI			Bridge, this is Engineering.					RIKER'S COM VOICE			Yes, Lieutenant.					GEORDI			Now that we are out of warp, I			would like to use this time to			make routine adjustments to the			deuterium control conduit. It's			overdue.        STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - TEASER        2.2C   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	as before.					RIKER				(to Picard)			That would preclude use of our			warp drive engines.					PICARD			How much time do these adjustments			require?					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			A few hours, sir.	Picard nods to Riker.					RIKER			You may proceed, Lieutenant La			Forge. Standard orbit.					GIBSON			Aye, sir. Standard orbit.3    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	establishes orbit about a large yellow planet.3A   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING	Geordi crosses to Wesley.					GEORDI			I am going to need an S-C-M, model			three, from stores.					WESLEY			Right away.	And he exits.4    INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	The glowing planet is featured on the Main Viewer.	Everyone's at their station except Wesley, who is not	present. Picard gazes at the image of the planet.					PICARD			Magnify.        STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - TEASER        3.4    CONTINUED:	The image on the Main Viewer enlarges.					PICARD			Not a very inviting planet. Even			for a research outpost.					TROI			I would have thought the			inhabitants of Daled Four would			send a future leader to a more			hospitable environment.					WORF			For some, security is more			important than comfort.					TROI			But sixteen years...					WORF			We are being hailed, Captain.					PICARD			Open hailing frequencies, Mister			Worf.					WORF			Hailing frequencies open.					PICARD			This is Captain Picard of the USS			Enterprise.	The voice transmission comes through with a heavy	harmonic on the carrier, making it sound like someone	talking from the bottom of a barrel.					DATA			The planet's troposphere is			distorting the signal.					PICARD				(to Worf)			Can you clean it up?					WORF			I'll try.	Worf makes some adjustments. Then nods to Captain	Picard.        STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - TEASER        4.4    CONTINUED: (2)					PICARD			This is Picard -- would you please			repeat your message?					FEMALE COM VOICE			I am Anya. Have you come for			Salia of Daled Four?					PICARD			That is correct.					ANYA			What species are you?					PICARD			Human.	There is a pause.					ANYA			Excellent. Bring us aboard. That			is all.	The bridge crew registers surprise at Anya's	sharpness.					RIKER			Friendly, isn't she?					PICARD			Whether they're friendly or not,			Salia has the rank of head of			state. We will treat both her			and Anya accordingly. Number			One, Mister Worf, let's greet our			visitors.	Picard, Riker and Worf head for the turbolift.5    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER PAD	(OPTICAL)	as TWO FIGURES MATERIALIZE: ANYA, elderly,	school-marmish; and SALIA, sixteen, gorgeous,	wide-eyed, but regal.        STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - TEASER        5.6    ANOTHER ANGLE	TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN stands at the controls.	Picard and Riker focus on Salia, who glances around	the room, enthusiastically taking in her new	environment.					PICARD			Welcome aboard the Enterprise.			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard.					ANYA				(re Salia)			This is Salia of Daled Four.					SALIA			I didn't feel a thing. Is that			normal when you are transported,			Captain?					PICARD			It is.	Salia steps off the transporter pad and looks toward	the control console. Anya steps off beside Salia,	eyes the crew suspiciously.					SALIA			Those must be the matter/energy			conversion controls. May I take			a look?					PICARD			Of course.					RIKER			If you like, I'll arrange a tour			of the ship.					SALIA			I'd love that.					ANYA				(firm)			No.	Disappointed, Salia looks at Anya.					ANYA				(continuing)			That won't be necessary. Just			show us our quarters, Captain			Picard.        STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - TEASER        6.6    CONTINUED:	Picard turns to Salia. It's obvious she accepts	Anya's authority.					PICARD			Very well.7    INT. CORRIDOR	Picard leads Salia, Anya toward her quarters. Worf	and Riker trail.					PICARD			We are housing you in the quarters			normally reserved for Starfleet			admiralty. I'm sure you'll find			them quite comfortable.8    ON WESLEY	as he EXITS a turbolift further down the corridor.	He carries a superconducting magnet.9    ANOTHER ANGLE	Salia gazes at Wesley, fascinated and attracted. She	steps away from the entourage and smiles innocently.					SALIA			That's a superconducting magnet,			isn't it?	Wesley can't take his eyes off her. He can barely get	his words out.					WESLEY			Yes... It's a... say, how did you			know that?					SALIA			Study, for the last sixteen years			it is all I could...	Before she can finish, Anya comes over and pulls Salia	away.					ANYA			Please walk ahead with me.	Salia starts away, then turns back to Wesley.        STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - TEASER        7.9    CONTINUED:					SALIA				(tinge of coyness)			You'd better be careful. I was			taught those can rip the iron			right out of your blood cells.9A   CLOSER - WESLEY AND SALIA	The attraction of her smile is even stronger than the	magnet's.					WESLEY			Who are you? No one mentioned			we were beaming up such a... a...					ANYA				(interrupting)			Please, Salia.	Wesley watches as Anya propels Salia into following	Picard into an intersecting corridor.	As Riker walks by, Wesley pulls him to the side.					WESLEY			I don't believe this! Who is she?					RIKER				(teasing)			I think she's a governess.					WESLEY				(impatient)			Not her. The girl.					RIKER			I doubt she'll have time for you,			my friend. She's slated to rule			an entire world.	Off Wesley's look of determination, we:									FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                                  STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE        8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:10   EXT. SPACE THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as the Enterprise leaves orbit and heads off at	impulse speed.10A  INT. WESLEY'S QUARTERS	Wesley is there alone. He is checking himself out	in the mirror. The meeting with Salia has suddenly	made him very aware of his appearance. The magnet he	was sent for is on his desk. The door CHIMES.					WESLEY			Come in.	The doors open and Data enters.					DATA			You wanted to see me.					WESLEY			Data -- the girl who just came on			board.					DATA			Salia of Daled Four.					WESLEY			There's almost nothing in the			computer about her.					DATA			Very little is known.					WESLEY			What can you tell me?					DATA			She was born on Daled Four. Her			parents were from opposite sides			of factions which have been			feuding for centuries. They died			shortly after her birth. A			Federation ship brought her and			her governess to Klavdia Three			to be raised in a neutral			environment.        STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE        9.10A  CONTINUED:					WESLEY			And now she's returning.					DATA			It is hoped she will unite the			factions and bring peace.	The conversation is interrupted.					GEORDI'S COM VOICE			Wesley, are you all right?					WESLEY				(surprised)			Geordi.				(then remembering the				 magnet)			Oh... Yes.. I'm fine... I just...					GEORDI			We are waiting for the part.					WESLEY			I'm on my way.	Wesley picks up the part and heads for the door.					WESLEY			Got to go. Thanks, Data.	Off Data's reaction:11   INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)	Minimum bridge crew. Worf is at his Aft Station.	Riker is in the Command Position.	Picard enters from the captain's Ready Room.					RIKER			Captain, we've laid in a course			for Daled Four. We will remain			on impulse power until Lieutenant			La Forge completes his			adjustments.					PICARD			Status report on our passengers,			Lieutenant Worf. Did the			accommodations meet with their			approval?          STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE       10.11   CONTINUED:	Troi enters from the turbolift, crosses to Picard.					WORF			I doubt anything ever meets with			that woman's approval, sir.					TROI			Captain, I'm concerned.					PICARD			About... ?					TROI			Our new passengers. Their			emotions do not seem to fit...				(puzzled)			... well, who they are and what			they're doing.					PICARD				(alert)			Are you suggesting they're not			who they say they are?					TROI			Actually... no. It's more like			they're not exactly what they seem			to be. At least, not exactly.	Picard puzzles on this a moment, then turns to his	communications controls.					PICARD			Captain Picard to Salia's			quarters. May I turn on the			viewer?					SALIA'S COM VOICE			Yes, of course.	Picard nods to Worf, who puts Salia's quarters on the	Main Viewer. Both he and Troi watch intently as:12   INT. SALIA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	at impulse speed.					PICARD			Are your quarters satisfactory?       STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE       11.12   CONTINUED:					SALIA			Yes. Very.	Anya enters from an adjoining room.					SALIA				(continuing)			Thank you for checking on us,			Captain. I only hope my quarters			on Daled Four will be this			luxurious.	Picard quickly assesses the situation.					PICARD			Feel free to contact me if you			need anything. Picard out.	The Main Viewer goes blank.									END INTERCUT:13   INT. MAIN BRIDGE	Picard turns to Troi.					TROI			What I sensed in that seems			entirely normal. Emotionally,			I judge her to be very drawn to			our young ensign.					DATA			What puzzles me, Captain, is how			she is expected to bring peace			to Daled Four. The one thing			we do know about it is that its			inhabitants have been fighting			throughout their recorded history.					PICARD			What do we know about the cause			of their wars?					DATA			Only that it is the difference			between night and day.					RIKER			Data, you just used a			colloquialism.       STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE       12.13   CONTINUED:					DATA			I did? I meant that Daled Four			does not rotate. One side has			constant night, the other constant			daylight. One might surmise that			the two hemispheres developed			disparate cultures, which is a			major cause of most wars.					PICARD			And yet somehow this child is			supposed to bring them together.					RIKER			She looks too delicate for a task			like that.					WORF			Do not be fooled by her looks.			The body is just a shell.14   OMITTED15   INT. SALIA'S QUARTERS	Salia is with an unusually dressed TEENAGE GIRL	(definitely not a "normal" inhabitant of the	Enterprise).					SALIA			How can I be a leader if I don't			know anything about my people?					TEENAGE GIRL			You will lead because you are			accepted by both sides. And			because it is in your blood.					SALIA			What am I expected to do when I			get there?					TEENAGE GIRL			You will know.					SALIA			How?       STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE       13.15   CONTINUED:					TEENAGE GIRL			You just will. Salia, you must			arrive with an open mind, without			preconceived ideas about the world			you will find or the people on			either side.					SALIA			It's very frustrating.					TEENAGE GIRL			Yes -- I know. You feel the weight			of so much responsibility. And			you're not sure you can live up			to everyone's expectations.					SALIA			It's not only that. Nobody's			asked me if this is something I			want.					TEENAGE GIRL			It is your duty.					SALIA			I have no choice.					TEENAGE GIRL			None. It won't be as bad as you			think. In fact it could be quite			wonderful. Besides... you are			the last and only chance.	Salia holds the teenage girl's eyes for a beat... then,	steps to the window and stares out at the stars. After	a moment, Salia looks down.16   SALIA'S POV	A cute FURRY ANIMAL rubs against Salia's leg.17   ANOTHER ANGLE	Salia sighs and pets it.					SALIA				(to animal, troubled)			Don't you think I'm going to need			more than instinct to do whatever			is expected of me on Daled Four?       STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE       14.18   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)	Geordi observes unusual engine probe GRAPHICS at the	control console.					GEORDI			Energy depletion level.					COMPUTER VOICE			Point oh-four percent and			increasing.					GEORDI			Wesley?19   WESLEY (OPTICAL)	stands on the lower catwalk, at the Deuterium Control	Conduit. He's daydreaming as he holds a fiber optics	laser probe that looks like a screwdriver with a blade	of pure VIOLET light.					GEORDI (O.S.)				(louder)			Wesley! Haven't you found the			defocused area yet?	Wesley snaps out of his daydream.					WESLEY			I'm looking!20   ANGLE TO INCLUDE GEORDI (OPTICAL)	who is now leaning over the catwalk, staring down at	Wesley.					GEORDI			I see the way you're looking.	Wesley whirls and drops his instrument.21   THE INSTRUMENT	bounces, almost falling off the catwalk.22   SCENE (OPTICAL)					WESLEY			Sorry.       STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE       15.22   CONTINUED:	He retrieves the probe.					WESLEY				(continuing)			I've got my mind on something.	There's a beat. Finally, Wesley explodes with	excitement.					WESLEY				(continuing)			Geordi, this girl they beamed up,			she's... she's perfect! Perfect!	Geordi shakes his head.					GEORDI			Now I understand why you can't			concentrate.					WESLEY			I'll do better.	Geordi starts back to his console as Wesley turns a	dial on the probe and a GREEN stem of light appears.	He touches it so that the blade of light penetrates the	conduit.					COMPUTER VOICE			Warning -- resonant field applied!			Warning!	Wesley pulls the probe from the conduit as Geordi	rushes back.					GEORDI			What is it?	Wesley adjusts the probe so that the stem changes from	GREEN to VIOLET.					WESLEY				(apologetic)			I had it on the wrong setting.					GEORDI				(beat)			I suppose it had to happen to you.			It usually does at about this age.					WESLEY			What usually does?       STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE       16.22   CONTINUED: (2)					GEORDI			Glands suddenly meshing together.			It happens to all of us.					WESLEY			You've got to be joking. Just			because I said she's			interesting...					GEORDI			You said she's "perfect."				(waves)			Go. You're no use here for now.			Go talk to her. Take the lift.	Wesley ignores and hops down beside Geordi and starts	for the exit. Suddenly he stops - insecure again.					WESLEY			That's silly, Geordi.				(hesitates)			Well, since you recommend it...			If she'll talk to me, how should			I approach her? What would I say?					GEORDI			Just say "Hi. I'm Wesley Crusher.			I'd like to talk to you."					WESLEY			And then what?					GEORDI			Whatever occurs to you.					WESLEY			What if nothing occurs to me?					GEORDI			Wesley, I don't really have time			for this. You're going to have			to ask somebody else.					WESLEY			Okay.	Wesley looks discouraged, turns and exits.23   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ON WORF	as he ROARS.       STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE       17.24   NEW ANGLE	Data is at Command, an n.d. crewmember at Ops and	ENSIGN GIBSON at Conn. They all look on in puzzlement	as Worf stops in mid-roar and calmly continues	speaking to Wesley, who stands beside him at Tactical.					WORF			That is how the Klingon lures a			mate.					WESLEY			Are you telling me to go yell at			Salia?					WORF			No. Men do not roar. Women roar.			Then they hurl heavy objects.			And claw at you.					WESLEY			What does the man do?					WORF			He reads love poetry. He ducks			a lot.					WESLEY			Yes, well, that might work for			Klingons, but I think I should			try something less dangerous.					WORF			Then go to her door. Beg like			a human.					DATA			It should be that simple, Wesley.			Judging by her appearance it is			likely you and Salia are			biologically compatible. Of			course, there may be a difference			in the histocompatibility complex			in the cell membrane.					WESLEY			Data! I want to meet her, not			dissect her.	Wesley walks to the turbolift just as Picard exits it.	Hold on Picard as he crosses the bridge.       STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE       18.24   CONTINUED:					PICARD			Captain Picard to Salia's			quarters.					SALIA'S COM VOICE			Yes, Captain?25   INT. SALIA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	Salia sits on her bed. The furry animal is nearby.					PICARD'S COM VOICE			May I activate the viewer?					SALIA			Certainly.	Picard's image appears on the viewer in Salia's living	room.					PICARD				(on viewscreen)			I've arranged for Anya to have			a tour of the ship.

WESLEY'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)	After a long moment, he walks to the food dispenser.	Wesley just stares at it, lost in thoughts of Salia.	The DOOR CHIME SOUNDS.					WESLEY			Come in.	The doors open.57   ANOTHER ANGLE	Salia stands in the doorway. She smiles uncertainly.58   SCENE	Wesley's heart quickens.					WESLEY			Salia!				(pause)			You shouldn't have come.       STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT FOUR       44.58   CONTINUED:					SALIA			Do you want me to leave?					WESLEY			I didn't say that.	Salia enters.					SALIA			Then you want me to stay.					WESLEY			Does Anya know you're here?					SALIA			That doesn't matter.					WESLEY				(pause)			I'm glad you came.

Wesley	can feel himself coming apart. He slowly moves his	lips to hers. They kiss.58A  CLOSE ON WESLEY AND SALIA	lost in deep, passionate kisses. Finally, they come up	for air.59   OMITTED60   ANOTHER ANGLE	SUDDENLY there is a roar... Wesley looks up to see	a monster in the doorway. Anya (as the monster) moves	into the room.61   WESLEY	Startled... jumps back. He instinctively places his	body between the monster and Salia.62   SCENE	In a frenzy, her eyes full of fire and fury, the	monster advances.					WESLEY				(touches his				 communicator)			Security to crew quarters!					SALIA (O.S.)			No... Anya... NO!	The monster continues to advance.	From behind Wesley hears a ROAR.	He turns... the sound is coming from deep within Salia	-- SUDDENLY, she transforms into a monster even more	frightening than Anya.       STAR TREK: "The Dauphin" - 12/23/88 - ACT FOUR       46.62   CONTINUED:	Wesley jumps back.

MAIN BRIDGE	Picard and Riker are at their forward stations.

CORRIDOR	As Salia and Aron near the Transporter Room, she sees	Wesley standing off to the side.					SALIA			Wesley.	For a moment he does not respond. Then:					WESLEY			Was it fun?	She moves toward him. The guard stays a discreet	distance away.					SALIA			What do you mean?					WESLEY			Playing humanoid.

Then TRANSMUTES	-- not in the violent, quivering manner as before, but	gracefully and sensually -- into a luminous form of such	beauty and elegance that it takes Wesley's breath away.	The glow from this creature lights his face and he	smiles... totally enraptured.	For a moment it is only Wesley and this creature.	Then:					WESLEY				(continuing)			Energize.	And the transporter chief hits the controls and they	all watch transfixed as the form BEAMS OUT.81   OMITTED82   ON WESLEY	knowing Salia is gone from his life forever.83   INT.
