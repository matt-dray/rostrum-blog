TEN FORWARD (OPTICAL)	Geordi and Susanna at a table, drinking drinks.	There's a subtext here... both have to wonder if	they're in some kind of danger... but they try to mask	it with casual humor and small talk...					SUSANNA			And then I almost married Paul			Bogrow...					GEORDI			Bogrow... which one was he?					SUSANNA			You remember... with the thin			moustache...					GEORDI				(remembering)			Not Bogrow...					SUSANNA				(laughs)			I know.					GEORDI			The one who used to drive you			crazy... you thought he was so			full of himself...					SUSANNA				(acknowledges)			Well, I decided I prejudged him			unfairly...      STAR TREK: "Identity Crisis" - 1/11/91 - ACT ONE      6.5    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Uh huh...					SUSANNA			And then I decided I'd been right			in the first place.					GEORDI				(laughs, shakes his				 head)			Bogrow...					SUSANNA			And what about you... how come			you never found the right girl?					GEORDI			I enjoy the bachelor's life too			much...					SUSANNA			That doesn't sound like my "little			brother" who always wanted advice			on women...					GEORDI			Well, you were obviously a great			advisor...	Susanna nods. Suddenly somber.					GEORDI			What do you think, Suz?					SUSANNA			I don't know.

TARCHANNEN OUTPOST - ESTABLISHING	After five years, sand dunes have begun to encroach	upon the abandoned facility.16   EXT. TARCHANNEN SURFACE - NEARBY (OPTICAL)	A dark and gloomy landscape... trapped in a perpetual	twilight. Riker, Worf, Data, Geordi and Susanna	MATERIALIZE in a clearing near a SHUTTLECRAFT.

He	shows them the torn uniform.					GEORDI			Commander Riker...	A beat as they all react. Then...					GEORDI			Where's Commander Leijten?	They look about. No sign of her.					RIKER				(keys insignia)			Susanna, report.	Nothing. Riker exchanges a grim look with the others.					RIKER			Fan out.

Geordi is taken aback. For	an instant, Susanna looks equally surprised... then	she starts backing away from him...					GEORDI			Susanna... ?	Geordi reaches for her, nice and slow... and she turns	to run.
