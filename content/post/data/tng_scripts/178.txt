PICARD HOME - DAY	The house sits adjacent to a small vineyard. The house	itself is made of stone and wood, and there is a	noticeable lack of 24th-century design or devices in	the building and its surroundings. There is an aged	historical plaque on the side of the house. The	setting is rural, and looks much like a farmhouse in	the French countryside would have looked in the 19th	century. Rene runs down the path, ahead of Picard...					RENE			He's here! He's here!	After a few seconds, MARIE PICARD comes out of the	house. She is in her mid-forties, and is wearing a	simple dress.

He is about six to eight years older than	Picard, and manages to appear dignified even as he	scrabbles about in the dirt working on the vines with	his hands. We can see that he devotes the same careful	attention to detail in his work as his brother does	on the bridge of his ship. Picard walks down the row	and stops in front of him. Robert looks up and sees	Picard, but remains on his knees. There is no	animosity on his face, but no welcome either, just	recognition.					ROBERT			So, you've arrived all right.				(beat)			Welcome home, Captain.	Picard tries very hard to be warm and brotherly and	anything but arrogant.					PICARD			Hello, Robert.					ROBERT			Did you shuttle out from the			village?					PICARD			No... I decided to walk.				(long beat)			I met Marie and Rene.					ROBERT			Good... good.	They've run out of things to say very quickly. Picard	tries his best to take a forward step.					PICARD			It's... good to see you.	But it comes out as just another pleasantry.					ROBERT				(inclines head toward				 house)			Make yourself at home.

Not the towering figure of legend that Wesley	(and we) expect to meet... Jack is of medium build,	about Wesley's height, finely boned, and perhaps most	shocking is that fact that Jack is about 24 years of	age. He wears an older Starfleet uniform with	lieutenant's insignia. His expression and attitude are	cheerful, confident... a man with his entire future	ahead of him.35   ANGLE - CLOSER	Wesley studies him... this is not what he expected.	Jack doesn't look much older than he does.
