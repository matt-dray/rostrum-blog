ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR	DATA is walking along, carrying a PADD. GEORDI catches	up to him from behind... out of breath, excited about	something.					GEORDI			Data, there you are... we need to			install that plasma conduit right			away. We're bringing the new warp			core on-line in less than three			hours.					DATA			I will go to deck twenty and begin			modifications.					GEORDI			Great.

ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS	Data walking along. Gradually, a RINGING SOUND is	heard echoing somewhere in the distance. Data tilts	his head in pain at the noise. The ringing is	intermittent, and sounds like an old-fashioned	telephone. A couple of rings go by. Data heads down	the corridor to find the sound...3    INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS	As Data walks, the ringing gets louder. He sees	something ahead of him... and stops at what he sees --         STAR TREK: "Phantasms" - 08/16/93 - TEASER         2.4    WIDEN TO INCLUDE	a group of THREE WORKMEN. They are dressed in plain	gray coveralls, holding old-fashioned PICKS and	SHOVELS. They have removed a large section of the WALL --	visible within is a distinctive-looking WARP PLASMA	CONDUIT. They are hacking at the conduit with the	tools.	Data reacts to the sight. Who are these people?					DATA			Excuse me. Do you have			authorization to work in this			area?	The workmen ignore him. Data eyes the wall with	concern.					DATA				(continuing)			You are dismantling a warp plasma			conduit. I must ask you to stop.	Again, no response. Data takes a step toward the	workmen and opens his mouth to speak -- but	inexplicably a HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK comes out, piercing	and strange. Data is startled to hear it. He closes	his mouth.	Suddenly, the workmen turn as one and head right for	Data -- their expressions are cold and ominous.					WORKMAN			Be quiet!	One of the workmen GRABS Data's arm and TEARS THE ARM	FROM ITS SOCKET. Data reacts, stunned. He moves to	defend himself but the workmen converge on him and Data	falls to the ground. We hear the sound of RIPPING	CLOTHES and WRENCHING METAL as they start to tear Data	apart, limb from limb. We see an arm... a leg...	Data's head... shocking --5    INT. DATA'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS	Data bolts awake in his bed, as if from a nightmare.	He glances around the room in momentary confusion...	then realizes it was a dream.

ENGINEERING	Geordi and Data are working at the "new" warp core,	which looks slightly different than the old one: the	dilithium chamber drawer has a new and distinctive	design... and it is not active. (NOTE: This is a	redress of the existing warp core set.) A couple of	ENGINEERING N.D.s are working in the background.	Geordi is looking at Data in surprise.

Everybody does from time to			time...					DATA			I have had one hundred eleven			dreams since I first discovered			the program nine months ago. In			all of that time, I have never			experienced such strange and			disturbing imagery in a dream.				(beat)			I believe it was... a nightmare.	Geordi keeps working.					GEORDI			Nightmares are part of dreaming,			Data. Maybe you just discovered			a new level to your program.	Data considers this.					DATA			Perhaps. I have also noted that			I am spending an inordinate amount			of time thinking about nightmare			imagery. One could almost say			that I am... preoccupied.					GEORDI			Well, that's perfectly normal.			When I have a nightmare, sometimes			I can't shake that weird feeling			for days...	Suddenly, a woman's voice interrupts from off camera --					TYLER'S VOICE			Commander La Forge!					GEORDI			Speaking of nightmares...	A fresh-faced, young woman -- ENSIGN TYLER --	approaches Geordi. She looks like she just walked out	of the Academy.

Thank you, Ensign.					TYLER			It's just like you said -- reset			the power tap... and the module			came right on-line. You have such			a wonderful grasp of engineering			principles. I'm learning so much			just by being around you...	She smiles at him. An awkward moment.					GEORDI			Well. Ah... why don't you go help			Farrel check the deuterium			cartridges. We're about to bring			the warp core on-line.					TYLER			Anything you say.	She gives him a big smile and walks off. Geordi's	smile fades away. Data gives him a puzzled look.					DATA			Geordi, you do not seem to			appreciate Ensign Tyler's			enthusiasm.					GEORDI			Oh, she's enthusiastic all			right... about me.					DATA			I do not understand.					GEORDI			She has a crush on me, Data.					DATA			And you do not share her			affection?					GEORDI			Frankly, no.

You are			concerned about unintentionally			hurting Ensign Tyler's feelings.					GEORDI			Yeah... something like that...					DATA			It would appear that you require			a third party to intervene on your			behalf.

She is wearing her regulation Starfleet	uniform.					TROI			Hello, Data...	She walks up to him, sees Spot.					TROI				(continuing)			What are you doing?					DATA			I am watching Spot sleep. In the			past fifteen minutes, he has had			twelve muscles spasms, which			indicates that he is dreaming.				(beat)			I have often wondered what he			dreams about. His twitching and			his rapid breathing would seem to			suggest anxiety -- but Spot has			never seen a mouse or any other			form of rodentia. Nor has he			encountered an insect, or been			chased by a canine.	Data considers. They watch Spot for a moment.					TROI				(continuing)			I understand you've had some			interesting dreams lately...				(off his look)			Geordi was a little worried about			you. He just wanted me to check			in and see how you were doing...      STAR TREK: "Phantasms" - REV. 08/17/93 - ACT ONE      11.13   CONTINUED:					DATA			That was very thoughtful of him.				(beat)			I have been debating whether or			not to initiate another dream			sequence.					TROI			Because of the nightmares... ?					DATA				(nods)			I have found them to be quite...			unsettling.	Troi takes a seat next to him, speaks gently.					TROI			Data, you shouldn't be afraid to			experience dark imagery in your			dreams.

Data sits on the bed and fluffs his	pillow. He then very consciously stretches out his	arms and "yawns". He lies down on the bed...14   CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE	as he shuts his eyes. A long moment goes by as we PUSH	IN on his face... then...15   PULL BACK TO REVEAL:16   INT. TEN FORWARD	CLOSE ON DATA as he opens his eyes. He is now sitting	at a table in the room. There is an eerie and surreal	quality to the scene. WE ARE EXPERIENCING DATA'S	DREAM.17   INCLUDE WORF	sitting opposite Data at the table. He is eyeing a	piece of CAKE that has a distinctive blue color similar	to that of a Starfleet science uniform. Sitting atop	the cake is a communicator pin, which Worf plucks off	and sets aside. He takes a bite of the cake.					WORF			Mmm. It is delicious.					DATA			What kind of cake are you eating?					WORF				(matter of fact)			It is cellular peptide cake...			with mint frosting. Would you			like a bite?        STAR TREK: "Phantasms" - 08/16/93 - ACT ONE        13.17   CONTINUED:					DATA			No, thank you.	Suddenly, the distinctive RINGING SOUND is heard	echoing somewhere in the room (as heard in the Teaser).	Data reacts in pain and touches his head.					DATA				(continuing)			Excuse me, Mister Worf.	Data stands and looks around the room, tries to locate	the source of the ringing sound (NOTE: the ringing	continues faintly throughout the scene).
