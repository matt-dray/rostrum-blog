She is late twenties, very	beautiful, energetic, extremely motivated and	ambitious. The mood is somber.					HANSON			The truth is... hell, we're not			ready. We've known they were			coming for over a year... we've			thrown every resource we've got			into this but still...					RIKER			Then, you're convinced it is the			Borg... ?					SHELBY			That's what I'm here to find out.			The initial descriptions of these			surface conditions are almost			identical to your reports from			system J-two-five.					PICARD				(acknowledges)			Mister Riker wrote those			reports... he agrees with you.  STAR TREK: "Best of Both Worlds" - REV. 4/6/90 - ACT ONE  4.6    CONTINUED:					HANSON				(setting protocol)			Commander Shelby took over Borg			tactical analysis six months ago.			I've learned to give her a wide			latitude when I want to get things			done... That's how I intend to			operate here.	It is clear that she's in charge as far as the admiral	is concerned.					SHELBY			My priority has been to develop			some kind, any kind of defense			strategy...					RIKER			Obviously nothing we have now can			stop them.					SHELBY				(acknowledges)			We've been designing new			weapons... but they're still on			the drawing board.					HANSON			We expected much more lead time.			Your encounter with the Borg was			over seven thousand light years			away...					PICARD			If this is the Borg, it would			indicate they have a source of			power far superior to our own...					SHELBY			I'd like to see the colony site			as soon as possible, Captain.					RIKER			It'll be night at the site in			thirty minutes. We've scheduled			an away team for dawn.					PICARD				(to Riker)			Why don't you show the commander			to her quarters...  STAR TREK: "Best of Both Worlds" - REV. 4/6/90 - ACT ONE  5.6    CONTINUED: (2)	Riker rises to escort her to the door...					RIKER			It's our poker night, Admiral.			There's always an open seat for			you...					HANSON				(would love to, but... )			Next time, Commander. Your			captain and I have a lot to cover.			But rumor has it that Commander			Shelby's played a hand or two...	Riker reacts, exchanges a look with Shelby who grins	as they EXIT. Hanson smiles. After the door closes...					HANSON			Keep your eye on her, Jean-Luc.			One impressive young lady...	Picard grins, obviously has a special affection for	this particular admiral.					PICARD			You seem rather taken with her,			J.P.					HANSON			Just an old man's fantasies. When			Shelby came into tactical, every			damned admiral's uncle had a take			on this Borg business... she cut			through it, put us on track.	Picard moves to a teapot, pouring...					PICARD			Earl Grey?					HANSON			Four sugars.				(beat)			She'd make you a hell of a first			officer.	Picard raises an eyebrow...					PICARD			I already have a hell of a first			officer.  STAR TREK: "Best of Both Worlds" - REV. 4/6/90 - ACT ONE  6.6    CONTINUED: (3)					HANSON			Don't tell me he's gonna pass up			another commission?					PICARD			One's available?					HANSON			The Melbourne.

Hasn't he told you?	Picard sighs, shakes his head, no... resigned to the	inevitable.					PICARD			Well, I guess I knew this day			would have to come... he'll make			a fine captain, J.P.					HANSON			You may want to tell him that.				(off Picard's look)			We're still waiting for his			decision. Hell, this is the third			time we've pulled out the			captain's chair for Riker. He			just won't sit down. And I'll			tell you something -- there are			a lot of young hotshots like			Shelby on their way up. Riker			could suddenly look like he's			standing still next to them. He's			hurting his career by staying put.			If I were you, I'd kick him in			the rear end for his own good.	As he drinks again, Picard reacts and...7    INT.

SHELBY'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS	As the door slides open and they ENTER.					SHELBY			I don't know exactly what I'm			looking for... but we've tested			the sections of the Enterprise's			hull that were damaged by the			Borg. There were some unusual			magnetic-resonance traces...					RIKER			A Borg footprint?					SHELBY			That's my theory. I'll see if			it holds up tomorrow.				(beat)			I've reviewed your personnel...			I'll be assigning Mister La Forge			and Mister Data to accompany me			on the away team...	Riker barely reacts... isn't prepared to allow her to	make crew assignments...					RIKER			I've... already assigned them to			the away team, Commander. And			I'll be with you as well.	A quick awkwardness.					SHELBY				(smiles)			Of course. I appreciate any			assistance you can offer.	She measures him for a beat.

Which job... ?					SHELBY			Yours, of course.				(off his look,				 "embarrassed")			I'm sorry... I heard you were			leaving.	And she's very good -- it could be taken as an innocent	faux pas by a lesser man, but Riker knows a fishing	expedition when he sees one... their eyes connect, he	won't bite...					RIKER			If I am...

Shelby studies Wesley	carefully... and then throws in her two chips to stay	in. But the tension is clearly between Riker and	Wesley. Riker gives him his best poker face.					RIKER				(to Wesley)			Time to put on the long pants,			Wes. I'll see your ten. And			raise you a hundred.					GEORDI			He's got the straight flush.					DATA			Not necessarily. Commander Riker			may be bluffing, Wesley.	Wes studies Riker's face.

I fold.					GEORDI				(groans)			With three jacks?				(shakes his head)			Wesley, you may get straight A's			in school, but you've still got			a little to learn about poker...	And so the attention turns to Shelby... who looks at	Riker and they look at each other and after a long look	beat...					SHELBY			I've only got two pair, Commander.			But I've got to see that blind			card. I'll call.	She puts in her chips. Riker blinks... looks down at	his card... turns it over. It busts his straight	flush. He's bluffing. Reactions.
