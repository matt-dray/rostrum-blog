TEN FORWARD	It is Jazz Night. RIKER is in civilian clothes playing	the trombone in a quartet. N.D. Supernumeraries sit at	tables listening and talking quietly among themselves.	It is a casual setting, with N.D. Waiters moving around	as the music plays.	TROI and BEVERLY are sitting together, enjoying the	music. Riker's quartet finishes a number and they join	in the applause. Riker bows, gestures to include his	fellow Band Members.					RIKER			Thank you... thank you very much.	As the applause dies down.					RIKER			Any requests tonight?	When no one else says anything, Troi gets a mischievous	look and calls out.					TROI			Night Bird.	Riker pretends he didn't hear her, looks out at the	crowd.    STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - REV. 03/19/93 - TEASER    2.2    CONTINUED:					RIKER			Anyone?					TROI				(louder)			Night Bird!	A few off-screen VOICES murmur their approval -- Riker	can't ignore her this time and shoots her a "why are	you doing this to me?" look. Troi just smiles back at	him as innocently as she can. Riker decides to take	the challenge.					RIKER			Ladies and Gentlemen... Night			Bird.	With a look at his fellow musicians, he taps out a	count and launches into the piece. After a moment.					BEVERLY			What was that all about?					TROI				(mischievous smile)			Wil's been trying to get this			piece right for ten years now.			He's never made it through the			solo.	Beverly looks at her, amazed to see her friend in so	mischievous a mood.					BEVERLY			Remember that dance recital I told			you I was doing?					TROI				(nods)			Next week.					BEVERLY			You're dis-invited.	Beverly holds a straight face for a beat before	smiling. Troi reacts to the music.       STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - 03/17/93 - TEASER       3.2    CONTINUED: (2)					TROI			Here it comes.	They both turn to look at Riker. One of the other	players is doing a solo and Riker is readying himself	to dive in for his solo. He casts a defiant glance	over at Troi, then brings his horn to his lips.	Suddenly...					DATA'S COM VOICE			Data to Commander Riker.	Riker stops and with a nod to the others -- who	improvise and keep playing -- moves away to take the	com.					RIKER				(hits combadge)			Riker, here.					DATA'S COM VOICE			Commander, you are needed on the			Bridge.					RIKER			On my way.	As he passes Troi and Beverly.					RIKER			Saved by the bell...	They smile and he moves off.3    INT. BRIDGE	It is the night shift; DATA and various N.D.'s. Riker	ENTERS from the Turbolift and moves to aft-science	where Data is working.					RIKER			You wanted to see me, Data?					DATA			Yes, sir. It appears that we will			be able to transport to the			surface sooner than we			anticipated.       STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - 03/17/93 - TEASER       4.3    CONTINUED:	Riker glances at the monitor, where an OKUDAGRAM shows	a cross-section of the planet and its atmosphere.					RIKER			Is the planet's distortion field			de-phasing sooner than you			predicted?					DATA			No, sir. But using the Potemkin's			transport logs from the original			evacuation, Commander La Forge and			I were able to modify the			Transporters.					RIKER				(catching on)			So we can beam through higher			distortion levels.					DATA				(nods)			The Transporters are now			considerably more efficient than			those used on the Potemkin eight			years ago.					RIKER			Glad to hear it. I almost didn't			make it off the surface that day.				(beat)			When can we get started?					DATA			Ninety-seven minutes.					RIKER			How long will the transport window			last?					DATA			Twenty-six minutes. After that,			the distortion field will re-phase.					RIKER			That doesn't give us much time to			retrieve the database.					DATA			The planet's proximity to its sun			will create two additional			transport windows in the next			three days.					RIKER			Let's hope that's enough.    STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - REV. 03/18/93 - TEASER    5.3    CONTINUED: (2)					DATA			It will have to be. The next			transport window will not occur			for another eight years, when the			planet's orbit brings it close			enough to the sun to de-phase the			distortion field.					RIKER			Notify the Away Team we're going			in ahead of schedule; I'll tell			the Captain.	Data nods and Riker heads for the Turbolift.4    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it orbits the planet.5    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM	GEORDI is doing a last minute check on the Transporter	system. A transport technician, ENSIGN PALMER is at	one of the side panels adjacent to the Transporter	chamber, assisting him. Riker, Data, and WORF ENTER	with an N.D. technician.					RIKER				(to Geordi)			How long until the transport			window opens?       STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - 03/17/93 - TEASER       6.5    CONTINUED:					GEORDI			Fourteen seconds.					RIKER				(to others)			Let's get in position.	Riker leads them up to the Transporter pad.					GEORDI			Whenever you're ready, Commander.					RIKER			Energize.6    INT. RESEARCH STATION (OPTICAL)	as the away team MATERIALIZES on the station's	transporter pad (the pad is not operational -- it is	merely a convenient place to beam in).	The station is standard Starfleet issue, with the	familiar console designs. It is dark, the only light	coming from the few consoles that are running. Even	with the low light, we can see that everything is neat	and orderly. Riker looks around in surprise.					RIKER			This isn't how I remember it; the			place was a mess when we left.					DATA			Commander...	Riker turns and Data gestures toward the ceiling. A	hole in the station's roof has been repaired with	pieces of scrap metal, welded into place.					RIKER			Someone's been here...	Worf reaches for his phaser, Data for his tricorder.					WORF			A vessel could have gotten caught			in the distortion field and			crashed. The survivors may have			taken shelter here.	Data is scanning with his tricorder.					DATA			Commander, someone is			approaching... a humanoid. Forty			meters due east and closing.       STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - 03/17/93 - TEASER       7.6    CONTINUED: (2)	Riker draws his phaser and gestures that they take	position behind various consoles. The suspense builds	as the unknown person approaches; we hear the SOUND of	footsteps outside the door.	Suddenly the door swings open and a human figure is	silhouetted there, though the light from outside	prevents us from seeing their face.	The figure steps inside and shuts the door, giving us	our first look at his face.	He could be Wil Riker's twin. Shocked, Riker steps out	from where he is...6A   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)	Both Rikers in frame. The two men look at each other	in amazement. Off this moment we...                                             FADE OUT.                         END OF TEASER                              STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT ONE    8.                            ACT ONE                             	FADE IN:           (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes)            7    INT. RESEARCH STATION - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)	The second Riker looks very much like Commander Riker	except his beard is a little fuller, his hair a little	wilder, and his face a little more weathered. He wears	simple civilian clothes that are slightly soiled here	and there, as if he's been working in them.	The other Riker looks warily from Data to Worf to	Riker.					RIKER			Who are you?					LT. RIKER			Who are you?					RIKER			Commander William Riker of the			Federation Starship Enterprise.	The other Riker reacts.					LT. RIKER			That's not possible. I'm Wil			Riker.	Riker glances at Data and Worf. Data steps forward.      STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - 03/17/93 - ACT ONE      9.7    CONTINUED:					DATA			May I ask how you got here?	Lieutenant Riker eyes this strange but seemingly	sincere man.					LT. RIKER			Eight years ago, I led a team to			evacuate this station.	Riker reacts.					RIKER			What ship were you on?					LT. RIKER			The Potemkin.	Riker looks at Data -- how does this man know these	things?					DATA			Why did you not return to the			Potemkin with the others?					LT. RIKER			I was the last one out. The			distortion field must have			interfered with the transport;			they lost their signal lock on me.			When I tried to contact the ship,			I couldn't get through the			interference.	Lieutenant Riker sees the looks on their faces.					LT. RIKER			Check with Starfleet; I'm sure			they recorded me lost that day.					RIKER			That's not what happened. I was			the last one out... but I made it			back to the Potemkin.      STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - 03/17/93 - ACT ONE      9A.7    CONTINUED: (2)	Lieutenant Riker reacts to this claim. Their stories	are clearly incompatible. Data regards them both	thoughtfully.					LT. RIKER			You don't believe me.					RIKER			It's not that we don't believe			you; it's just hard to see how			both our stories could be true.				(beat)			Would you be willing to let our			Doctor check you out?      STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - 03/17/93 - ACT ONE      10.7    CONTINUED: (3)					LT. RIKER			Of course.					RIKER			Lieutenant Worf, take him to			Sickbay. Notify the Captain as			soon as you're aboard.	Lieutenant Riker watches the Klingon as he steps toward	him. He is clearly surprised to see him in a Starfleet	uniform. Things have really changed.					WORF				(activates combadge)			Worf to Enterprise. Two to beam			up.8    ON RIKER	as we hear the SOUND of DEMATERIALIZATION. He doesn't	know what to make of all this. When his double is	gone, he casts a glance at Data.					RIKER			Let's get to work.9    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)	as it orbits the planet.10   INT. SICKBAY	where Beverly is checking out Lieutenant Riker. TWO	SECURITY GUARDS hang back by the door. He is sitting	on the table, watching her as she works. As she raises	her scanner upwards their eyes meet for a moment. This	is very strange for her -- in a way she feels that she	knows this man, but of course she doesn't.   STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT ONE   11.10   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			Looks like you fractured your arm			a few years ago.					LT. RIKER			I was underneath the station			making repairs when an earthquake			hit -- I got caught in a			rockslide. I had to set it			myself.	Beverly nods, realizing how painful this must have	been. PICARD ENTERS from the corridor. He stops when	he sees Lieutenant Riker. Although Worf has filled him	in, nothing could have prepared him for this very	strange encounter.					PICARD			Captain Jean-Luc Picard.					LT. RIKER			Lieutenant Wil Riker, sir.	Picard chooses his words carefully.					PICARD			If you are Wil Riker, if there are			two of you... then something			extraordinary has occurred. I			hope you understand our need to			verify your claim.					LT. RIKER			Yes, sir.	Picard turns to Beverly for a report.					BEVERLY			Genetically, he's			indistinguishable from Commander			Riker.	Picard considers for a beat before asking what seems an	almost impolite question.					PICARD			Could some sort of cloning be			involved?					BEVERLY			I don't think so, there's no			genetic drift.					PICARD			But that isn't conclusive.   STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT ONE   12.10   CONTINUED: (2)					BEVERLY			That's why I compared their brain			scans. Brain organization			patterns are as unique as...			fingerprints. Except for some			minor differences, theirs are			identical.					PICARD			Can't brain patterns be cloned?					BEVERLY			No. They're determined by			experience, mostly in early			childhood.	Picard takes this in.					PICARD			How could two men have shared the			same childhood experiences? It			doesn't make any sense.	Lieutenant Riker has been listening quietly, and now	speaks to Picard with urgency.					LT. RIKER			Sir, I am Wil Riker. I don't know			who or what made it back to the			Potemkin that day, but it wasn't			me.					PICARD				(stopping him)			Lieutenant -- my Chief Engineer is			checking over the transport logs			from the Potemkin. They may shed			some light on what happened.	Lieutenant Riker backs off.					LT. RIKER			Yes, sir.	Picard tries to be reassuring.					PICARD			Don't worry, we'll get to the			bottom of this.	Lieutenant Riker nods, relieved that at least now his	story is being taken seriously.      STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - 03/17/93 - ACT ONE      13.10   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			In the meantime you'll be taken to			quarters. Make yourself			comfortable.					LT. RIKER			I will, sir. The replicators on			the station stopped working a long			time ago. It's been a while since			I had a decent meal.	He flashes a grin so like Commander Riker's that our	people are struck by it. He hops off the bed and nods	to Beverly.					LT. RIKER			Doctor...	The Security officers and Lieutenant Riker EXIT.	Picard and Beverly exchange a look. This is all very	strange to them.11   INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE	Geordi is reporting his findings to Picard, Commander	Riker, Data, Beverly and Troi.					GEORDI				(to Riker)			... apparently there was a massive			energy surge in the distortion			field around the planet just at			the moment you tried to beam out.			The Transporter Chief tried to			compensate by initiating a second			containment beam.					DATA			An interesting approach. He must			have been planning to reintegrate			the two patterns in the transport			buffer.					GEORDI			Turns out he didn't have to.			Commander Riker's pattern			maintained its integrity with just			the one containment beam -- he			made it back to the ship just			fine.   STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - REV. 03/18/93 - ACT ONE   13A.11   CONTINUED:					BEVERLY			What happened to the second beam?					GEORDI			The Transporter Chief shut it			down, but somehow... it was			reflected back to the surface.					PICARD			And another Wil Riker materialized			there.					RIKER			How could the second pattern have			maintained its integrity?	Geordi's tone indicates he's making his best guess.					GEORDI			The containment beam must have had			the exact same phase differential			as the distortion field.   STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - REV. 03/19/93 - ACT ONE   14.11   CONTINUED: (2)	Riker has to know.					RIKER			Which one of us is... real?	The answer is clearly important to him.					GEORDI			Both. You were both re-materialized			from a complete			pattern.	Riker struggles to assimilate this information.					BEVERLY				(to Riker)			Up to that moment, you were the			same person.					PICARD			But over the last eight years, you			and...	Picard searches for a way to differentiate them.					PICARD				(continuing)			-- Lieutenant Riker have lived			very different lives. You're			different people now.	He addresses the others.					PICARD			For us, it's a little like meeting			a close friend's twin. You can't			help feeling that you know them...			but of course you don't.	Picard ponders the strangeness of it.      STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - 03/17/93 - ACT ONE      15.11   CONTINUED: (3)					PICARD			No matter how strange it may seem			to us... there are now two Wil			Rikers aboard this vessel.			Getting used to the idea may take			a while... especially for you,			Wil.	Riker nods an acknowledgement.					RIKER			I'll be all right, sir.					PICARD			Lieutenant Riker will be here for			a few days at least. We should do			everything we can to make him feel			comfortable and welcome.	There is a consensus about this in the room.					RIKER			That still leaves us with the			problem of how to retrieve the			database. The station's computer			is only partially operational.					DATA			Many of its components have been			removed. Apparently Lieutenant			Riker used them to keep the			station's radiation shield			operational.					PICARD			Can we repair it, at least enough			to access the database?					RIKER			Without knowing what he did, it'll			be tough.					BEVERLY			Maybe he could help?	Picard considers.					PICARD			He was alone down there a long			time. I'm hesitant to send him			back until he's been evaluated.					TROI			I'll talk to him.   STAR TREK: "Second Chances" - REV. 03/19/93 - ACT ONE   16.11   CONTINUED: (4)	Riker glances up when she says this.					PICARD			Thank you, Counselor.	Picard stands and the meeting breaks up.12   INT. LIEUTENANT RIKER'S QUARTERS	Lieutenant Riker is cleaned up, now wearing a gold	Lieutenant's Uniform. He is sitting at a table,	looking at the screen of a desktop terminal. A now	empty dinner plate is pushed off to the side. He takes	a sip from his beverage as he studies the screen.13   ANOTHER ANGLE	that includes the screen. We see that he is looking	over Commander Riker's service record, finding out what	his double has been up to these past eight years.	The door CHIMES. Lieutenant Riker stands and moves	toward it.					LT. RIKER			Come in.	The door OPENS to reveal Troi standing there.	Lieutenant Riker just stares at her for a moment.

RIKER			Come in.	The door OPENS to reveal Riker, holding a carrying	case. When he sees the two of them:					RIKER			I'm sorry --					LT.

He looks at Riker, unsure...	But when he opens it he finds his trombone... the one	he learned to play on. He knows what it means to Riker	and is amazed that he's willing to give it up.					RIKER			My quarters are full of things			that used to be yours. I figured			you should at least have this.	Lieutenant Riker looks down at the trombone in his	hands. Words can't express his appreciation.					LT. RIKER			Thanks.	Riker nods.
