They			shoot negative ions into the			planet's stratosphere --	Amanda watches Riker as he takes a PADD from an ND and	begins checking it over. The ND moves away, leaving	Riker standing alone near the overhang which contains	the control booth.					GEORDI'S VOICE				(continuing)			-- where they come into contact			with airborne pollutants and			transfer their charge. The			filters have positively charged			intake vents that the pollutants			become attracted to; that sets			up a kind of ionic current in the			atmosphere.	Amanda isn't even hearing his techno-ramble, her	attention is now completely on the handsome figure cut	by the First Officer.9A   CLOSE ON A TOOL CASE	on the railing of the overhang. It suddenly moves	forward, as though of its own volition, and teeters	on the edge of the stack.9B   ANGLE ON AMANDA	as her eye is caught by the movement.

Maybe they've found her out?					AMANDA				(hesitantly)			Come in.	The door opens to reveal TROI standing there holding	a puppy.					TROI			Commander Riker told me you liked			dogs...	Amanda is delighted.

But be warned -- he has			an appetite for boots.	Amanda laughs and puts Henry down to explore the room.					AMANDA			By the time Ensign Janklow gets			back I'll have Henry shaking			hands.	She and Troi move to chairs and sit.					TROI			Doctor Crusher tells me you're			considering a career in zoology.        STAR TREK: "True Q" - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT ONE        13.10   CONTINUED: (2)					AMANDA			I was... but this morning I			decided to become a Starfleet			doctor... then by this afternoon			I realized I was really meant to			be a Chief Engineer.	They share a smile.					AMANDA			What does a ship's counselor do?			Maybe that's what I'll want to			be by tomorrow.	Troi smiles at the young woman's enthusiasm.					AMANDA			There are just so many things I'm			interested in... sometimes I worry			that I'll never focus on just			one thing...					TROI			There's nothing wrong with keeping			your options open.					AMANDA			I'm just afraid I won't have			enough time for everything I want			to do.
