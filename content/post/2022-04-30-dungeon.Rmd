# tl;dr

I wrote a (very!) basic procedure to generate randomised ASCII-character tile-based dungeons for [{r.oguelike}, an in-development roguelike-game-in-a-package for R](https://matt-dray.github.io/r.oguelike/).

# Generate to accumulate

[I wrote recently](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/04/25/r.oguelike-dev/) about [the {r.oguelike} R package](https://matt-dray.github.io/r.oguelike/), which contains the beginnings of [a roguelike game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) written entirely in R.

A key element of roguelike games is that [the dungeons should be procedurally generated](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Berlin_Interpretation)[^procedural] so that the player gets a different one each time they play.

There are some great examples of algorithmic systems used for dungeon creation. See [the talk by Herbert Wolverson at Roguelike Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlLIOgWYVpI), for example.

I thought I'd go with something a bit more... _na√Øve_. Simple enough for my little game. And no maths!

# Excavations

## Prepare

You can [install the (currently work-in-progress) {r.oguelike} package from GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike).

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
install_github("matt-dray/r.oguelike")
```

Before we begin, note that we can talk about generative 'dungeons' in the context of connected rooms, like in [_The Binding of Isaac_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game)), or more freeform structures, like world maps in [_Dwarf Fortress_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress). We're going for the latter, which amounts to interconnected caverns.

The function we'll be using is called `generate_dungeon()`, which prints to the console a cavern that differs each time you run it.[^export] You can alter the output using the arguments:

* `iterations` is the number of times to 'grow' the caverns
* `n_row` and `n_col` give the map dimensions
* `n_rooms` is the number of rooms to spawn
* `is_snake` for a cavern that is continuous from left to right and wiggly
* `is_organic` for a more freeform vs 'square' look to the caverns
* `colour` to print the output in colour

There's also a `seed` argument that lets you generate the same dungeon every time you run the function with the same parameters.

## Demo

So here's a smallish dungeon with 3 growth iterations for 3 starting rooms, on a map with tile dimensions of 20 rows by 30 columns, which you can reproduce by using the seed `123`.[^changes]

```{r generate-dungeon, eval=FALSE}
dungeon <- r.oguelike::generate_dungeon(3, 20, 30, 4, seed = 123)
```

Here's a screenshot of the output so you can see it in colour.

So, in this example you can see we have a little cavern with some interconnected areas and a dead-end in the lower right. The tiles represent:

* cavern-floor tiles (black periods), which is where the character can traverse
* cave wall tiles (red hashmarks)
* a boundary around the edge (yellow hyphens and pipe symbols)

Note that the actual output from the function---a matrix that represents the dungeon tiles---is returned invisibly.

# The procedure

How is the output created? The procedure is very simple: lay a map; select random sites for rooms[^rooms]; connect them with corridors; expand the rooms generatively.

These steps are handled in [the `generate_dungeon()` function](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike/blob/main/R/dungeon.R) by a few [sub-functions](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike/blob/main/R/dungeon-utils.R), which looks a bit like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
m <- .create_dungeon(n_row, n_col, n_rooms, seed)

m <- .connect_dungeon(m, is_snake)

i <- 0

while (i < iterations) {
  m <- .grow_dungeon(m)
  i <- i + 1
}

.draw_dungeon(m, colour)
```

Not much right? But what's actually happening?

1. First, `.create_dungeon()`:
    - prepares a matrix with dimensions `n_row` and `n_col`
    - fills the matrix with tiles that represent non-traversable rocky cave walls (`#`)
    - selects randomly an `n_rooms` number of non-edge tiles in that map and mark them with traversable cavern-floor tiles (`.`)
1. Then `.connect_dungeon()` (if the argument `is_organic` is `TRUE`):
    - connects rooms with straight, right-angled corridors made of cavern tiles (connected from lowest to highest if `is_snake = TRUE`, otherwise randomly)
1. Now the iterative bit, `.grow_dungeon()`, which happens in a while-loop whose `iterations` are determined, which:
    - expands the cavern where each cavern-floor tile spawns randomly a new cavern-floor tile to its north, south, east or west, using `sample()`
1. Finally, `.draw_dungeon()`:
    - prints to the console, using `cat()`, each line of the matrix in turn
    - colours the output with [the {crayon} package](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon), if requested

And we can look at the output at each step to see what's going on:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2022-04-30-dungeon_files/r.oguelike-generate.gif" alt="Gif showing the steps to generate an ASCII-character tiled dungeon in R.

</div>

We started here with the map that has randomly-selected room tiles, then joined them with corridors, then iterated 1, 2, 3 times to expand out the cavern floor space.

# Going deeper

So! I encourage you to play with this. Mess around with the arguments and see what you can come up with. I recommend a much larger dungeon map than demonstrated here, with a larger `n_rooms` value. Try out `is_organic = FALSE`, because I think the results generally look more 'artificial', i.e. the resulting dungeon looks more 'man-made'. I think `is_snake = TRUE` results in something that could be more like a gauntlet: get from the start, on the left, to the end, on the right, via whatever obstacles you put in the way.

I could've shown you more examples of what happens when you toy with these arguments, but this is a technique that we in the business call 'getting you to download the package and try it yourself'.

Smashing, right, so what do we do this? Well, the {r.oguelike} package already has the rudiments of a 'game', and now has the rudiments of dungeon maps. We step closer to release on all major videogame platforms and the promise of billions of dollars in sales.

Next is to place characters, enemies and items into these dungeon spaces. Ideally we can create a system to place certain objects in certain spaces, like treasure in the far reaches of a dead-end, or a monster that's in a narrow corridor and must be defeated to advance.

That's much more roguelike-like, like, amirite?

[^procedural]: I'm not a computer scientist, but Wikipedia says 'procedural' involves 'creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated assets and algorithms coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power'. The page [specifically points out roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#Video_games) as having these properties, so I assume what I've done can be described as 'procedural'?
[^export]: In future, this function will be integrated into the `start_game()` function, but I may still export it so people (i.e. me) can use it for fun.
[^changes]: Underlying changes to the code may prevent this from being recreated in future. I'm using v0.0.0.9005 (this ridiculous number means it's _very_ dev) of the {r.oguelike} package for this post.
[^rooms]: Akshually, it's not just a case of choosing a random set of four points within the length of the matrix. The vector of the sequence of the length of the matrix is split `n_rooms` times and we sample from within each of those chunks. This, hopefully, should keep the dungeons relatively-well spread out.
