# tl;dr

I wrote a (very!) basic procedure to generate randomised ASCII-character tile-based dungeons for [{r.oguelike}, an in-development roguelike-game-in-a-package for R](https://matt-dray.github.io/r.oguelike/).

# Generate to accumulate

[I wrote recently](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/04/25/r.oguelike-dev/) about [the {r.oguelike} R package](https://matt-dray.github.io/r.oguelike/), which contains the beginnings of [a roguelike game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) written entirely in R.

A key element of roguelike games is that [the dungeons should be procedurally generated](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Berlin_Interpretation)[^procedural] so that the player gets a different one each time they play.

There are some great examples of algorithmic systems used for dungeon creation, like wave function collapse, binary space partitions, cellular automata, etc.[^bands] See [the talk by Herbert Wolverson at Roguelike Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlLIOgWYVpI), for example.

I thought I'd go with something a bit more... _na√Øve_. Simple enough for my little game. And no maths!

# Excavations

## Prepare

You can [install the (currently work-in-progress) {r.oguelike} package from GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike).

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
install_github("matt-dray/r.oguelike")
```

<div class="tip"> `r fontawesome::fa("exclamation-circle")` <b>Note</b>

The {r.oguelike} package is a work in progress and is developing at pace. Many things explained below may have been superseded or changed by the time you read this.

</div>

Before we begin, note that we can talk about generative 'dungeons' in the context of connected rooms, like in [_The Binding of Isaac_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game)), or more freeform structures, like world maps in [_Dwarf Fortress_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress). We're going for the latter, which amounts to interconnected caverns.

The function we'll be using is called `generate_dungeon()`, which prints to the console a cavern that differs each time you run it.[^export] You can alter the output using the arguments:

* `iterations` is the number of times to 'grow' the caverns
* `n_row` and `n_col` give the map dimensions
* `n_rooms` is the number of rooms to spawn
* `is_snake` for a cavern that is continuous from left to right and wiggly
* `is_organic` for a more freeform vs 'square' look to the caverns
* `colour` to print the output in colour

You can always run `set.seed()` before `generate_dungeon()` to create the same dungeon every time you run the function with the same parameters.

## Demo

So here's a smallish dungeon with 3 growth iterations for 3 starting rooms, on a map with tile dimensions of 20 rows by 30 columns.

```{r generate-dungeon, eval=FALSE}
dungeon <- r.oguelike::generate_dungeon(3, 20, 30, 4)
```

Here's a screenshot of the output so you can see it in colour.

<div class="figure">

So, in this example you can see we have a little cavern with some interconnected areas and a dead-end in the lower right. The tiles represent:

* cavern-floor tiles (black periods), which is where the character can traverse
* cave wall tiles (red hashmarks, which can't be passed through)
* a boundary around the edge (yellow hyphens and pipe symbols)

Note that the actual output from the function---a matrix that represents the dungeon tiles---is returned invisibly.

## More examples

I think this process works best with a larger map grid (i.e. higher `n_row` and `n_col` values), more randomly-selected room start-points (higher `n_rooms`) and more growth steps (higher `iterations`).

Here's a larger maze-like dungeon:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2022-04-30-dungeon_files/dungeon-maze.png" alt="A dungeonlike map made from ASCII characters. Cave tiles are marked with a period and are black. Rock wall tiles are marked with red hashmarks. The outer boundary wall is made of yellow hyphens and pipe symbols. The corridors snake around, but are fully connected. There are some dead ends." width="100%"/>
</div>

This one came out more like a doughnut, with a central 'pillar' of rock-wall tiles:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2022-04-30-dungeon_files/dungeon-donut.png" alt="A dungeonlike map made from ASCII characters. Cave tiles are marked with a period and are black. Rock wall tiles are marked with red hashmarks. The outer boundary wall is made of yellow hyphens and pipe symbols. The cave is a big circle, connected around a single, central mass of rock." width="100%"/>
</div>

And this one is the result of using `is_snake = TRUE`, which creates a single, long snaking cavern:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2022-04-30-dungeon_files/dungeon-snake.png" alt="A dungeonlike map made from ASCII characters. Cave tiles are marked with a period and are black. Rock wall tiles are marked with red hashmarks. The outer boundary wall is made of yellow hyphens and pipe symbols. The corridor is a single snaking corridor from left to write, wiggling from top to bottom." width="100%"/>
</div>

Here's what happens if we set `is_organic = FALSE` and `is_snake = TRUE`. You get much obvious 'rooms' connected by small corridors:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2022-04-30-dungeon_files/dungeon-rooms.png" alt="A dungeonlike map made from ASCII characters. Cave tiles are marked with a period and are black. Rock wall tiles are marked with red hashmarks. Four small, discrete rooms made of floor tiles are connected from left-to-right with corridors that are a single tile wide." width="100%"/>
</div>

And if we set `is_organic = FALSE` and `is_snake = FALSE` we get something interconnected, but looks more 'artificial' or manmade with its mostly square walls:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2022-04-30-dungeon_files/dungeon-artificial.png" alt="A dungeonlike map made from ASCII characters. Cave tiles are marked with a period and are black. Rock wall tiles are marked with red hashmarks. There are many straight-line corridors of different widths, which looks less organic and cavelike and more man-made." width="100%"/>
</div>

You can see how the shape of these dungeons can be used as part of the storytelling. Is the player in a big cavern, hollowed out long in the past, or perhaps in an underground city, chiselled-out by dwarves?

# The procedure

How is the output created? The procedure is very simple: lay a map; select random sites for rooms[^rooms]; connect them with corridors; expand the rooms generatively.


## Functions

These steps are handled in [the `generate_dungeon()` function](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike/blob/main/R/dungeon.R) by a few [sub-functions](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike/blob/main/R/dungeon-utils.R), which looks a bit like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
m <- .create_dungeon(n_row, n_col, n_rooms, seed)

m <- .connect_dungeon(m, is_snake)

i <- 0

while (i < iterations) {
  m <- .grow_dungeon(m)
  i <- i + 1
}

.draw_dungeon(m, colour)
```

Not much right? But what's actually happening?

1. First, `.create_dungeon()`:
    - prepares a matrix with dimensions `n_row` and `n_col`
    - fills the matrix with tiles that represent non-traversable rocky cave walls (`#`)
    - selects randomly an `n_rooms` number of non-edge tiles in that map and replaces them with traversable cavern-floor tiles (`.`)
2. Then `.connect_dungeon()` (this function is run now if `is_organic = TRUE`, otherwise after `.grow_dungeon()` in the next step):
    - connects rooms with straight, right-angled corridors made of floor tiles (connected from lowest to highest if `is_snake = TRUE`, otherwise randomly)
3. Now the iterative bit, `.grow_dungeon()`, which happens in a while-loop whose `iterations` are determined, which:
    - spawns randomly with `sample()` a new cavern-floor tile to the north, south, east or west or current floor tiles
    - performs one round of spawning for the number of `iterations` provided
4. Finally, `.draw_dungeon()`:
    - prints to the console, using `cat()`, each line of the matrix in turn
    - colours the output with [the {crayon} package](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon), if requested

And we can look at the output at each step to see what's going on:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2022-04-30-dungeon_files/r.oguelike-generate.gif" alt="Gif showing the steps to generate an ASCII-character tiled dungeon in R. First, a map is created with four randomly-placed floor tiles, then they're connected with corridors, then the tiles around the floor tiles are converted from wall to floor tiles, randomly, for three iterations." width="100%"/>
</div>

The map started with four randomly-selected floor tiles; these were joined them with straight, right-angled corridors; then three iterations expanded out the floor space from the existing floor tiles.

## Sampling

Let's focus on the simple bit of the `.grow_dungeon()` function that actually expands the floor.

Here's a tiny example matrix of wall tiles with a floor tile in the middle:

```{r}
m <- matrix("#", 3, 3)  # wall tiles
m[2, 2] <- "."  # floor tiles
m
```

Now we find the adjacent tiles and sample a random number of them to also become floor tiles.

```{r}
start_tile <- which(m == ".")

adjacent_tiles <- c(
  start_tile - 1,        # north
  start_tile + 1,        # south
  start_tile - ncol(m),  # east 
  start_tile + ncol(m)   # west 
)

change_to_floor <- sample(
  adjacent_tiles,
  sample(1:length(adjacent_tiles), 1)
)

m[change_to_floor] <- "."

m
```

So between one and all of the adjacent tiles could be turned to  a floor tile. 

This is then repeated for the number of `iterations` provided by the user.

# Going deeper

So! I encourage you to play with this. 

Mess around with the arguments and see what you can come up with. I recommend larger maps, with a larger `n_rooms` value. Try out `is_organic = FALSE` (the results generally look more 'artificial', i.e. the resulting dungeon looks more 'man-made') and `is_snake = TRUE` (looks more like a gauntlet from one end to the other).

Smashing, right, so what do we do this? Well, the {r.oguelike} package already has the rudiments of a 'game', and now has the rudiments of dungeon maps. Next is to place characters, enemies and items into these dungeon spaces.

<div class="tip"> `r fontawesome::fa("exclamation-circle")` <b>Update</b>

Just after writing this post, I put together the dungeon-generating code with the the code for placing characters/items and [it seems to work pretty well](https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1522289244445753344?s=20&t=lk0UHHNf23MYC2ir018ZTg). We step closer to release on all major videogame platforms and the promise of billions of dollars in sales!

</div>

Ideally we can also create a system to place certain objects in certain spaces, like treasure in the far reaches of a dead-end, or a monster that's in a narrow corridor and must be defeated to advance. Stuff like locked doors would be great too.

That's much more roguelike-like, like, amirite?

[^bands]: Definitely one of these should be the name for your new band.
[^procedural]: I'm not a computer scientist, but Wikipedia says 'procedural' involves 'creating data algorithmically as opposed to manually, typically through a combination of human-generated assets and algorithms coupled with computer-generated randomness and processing power'. The page [specifically points out roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation#Video_games) as having these properties, so I assume what I've done can be described as 'procedural'?
[^export]: In future, this function will be integrated into the `start_game()` function, but I may still export it so people (i.e. me) can use it for fun.
[^rooms]: Akshually, it's not just a case of choosing a random set of four points within the length of the matrix. The vector of the sequence of the length of the matrix is split `n_rooms` times and we sample from within each of those chunks. This, hopefully, should keep the dungeons relatively-well spread out.
