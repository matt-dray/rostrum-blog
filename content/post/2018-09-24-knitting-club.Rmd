# tl;dr

I made a couple of training resources about R Markdown for reproducibility:

* [Knitting Club](#knitting-club){target='_blank'} ([see the slides](https://matt-dray.github.io/knitting-club/){target='_blank'} or [source](https://github.com/matt-dray/knitting-club){target='_blank'})
* [Quick R Markdown](#quick-r-markdown){target='_blank'} (see the [slides](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/#1){target='_blank'} or [source](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/){target='_blank'}).

# Reproducibility

It's often important to recreate and verify prior work, as well as update it in future as data changes. In government we're using a code-based approach called [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/){target='_blank'} (RAP) to automate and make reproducible our statistical publications; speeding up our work while reducing error and building confidence.

R has many packages that help with reproducibility. Take a look at [the CRAN Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html){target='_blank'} for some examples.

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/){target='_blank'} is a particularly useful and ubiquitous tool. It allows you to execute R code inside your document and 'knit' it into a readable report with the {knitr} package by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/){target='_blank'}. You can re-run the code, or alter the parameters and re-knit it without stress. This is much faster and less error-prone versus a workflow that moves data between a database, spreadsheet and word processor.

The [R Markdown bible](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/){target='_blank'} has been released recently by Yihui Xie, JJ Allaire and Garrett Grolemund and is the go-to resource for creating [reports, presentations, dashboards, websites, books and blogs](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html){target='_blank'} in R Markdown.

# Resources

I made some short resources earlier in the year to help beginners in my organisation learn about R Markdown. They're a little rough, but got the job done. I'm unlikely to update them in future, but you can go to the source on GitHub and leave an issue, or make a pull request.

## Knitting Club{#knitting-club}

Knitting Club is a document about R Markdown and {knitr} made with R markdown and {knitr}. It's [freely available on the web](https://matt-dray.github.io/knitting-club/){target='_blank'} and you can find [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/knitting-club){target='_blank'}. 

I presented this document in a cross-department [Coffee & Coding](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/resource-coffee-and-coding.html){target='_blank'} session in April 2018. The blurb was:

> Do you have *woolly* knowledge of document creation in R? *Needle* little help? Matt Dray will drop some *purls* of wisdom and *unravel a yarn* about the *knitty*-gritty of R Markdown and the ‘knitr’ package for one-click document creation. Don’t get the *point*? If a deadline is *looming*, you’ll avoid a *stitch*-up from endless re-running of code and copy-pasting of outputs into a Word document. Come along and have *a ball*!

Ha.

## Quick R Markdown{#quick-r-markdown}

If the Knitting Club document is too long, you can check out this shorter slide-based introduction to R Markdown below. You can also [access the slides alone](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/#1){target='_blank'} and find [the source on GitHub](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/){target='_blank'}.
