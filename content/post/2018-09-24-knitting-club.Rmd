# RAP and the rise of reproducibility

The UK government has got better at producing statistical reports in a reproducible way. A turning point was the creation of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) -- a method for making releases easier to recreate, test and audit. [Matthews Upson and Gregory](https://www.machinegurning.com/posts/) of [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/) (GDS) have [described](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/) and [enshrined](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/) this process and [enabled](https://www.udemy.com/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/) others to [continue its spread](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/11/27/transforming-the-process-of-producing-official-statistics/).

One useful and accessible tool for reproducibility is [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), which allows you to execute R code inside your document and 'knit' it into a readable report. You can re-run the code, or alter the parameters and re-knit it without stress. This is much faster and less error-prone versus a workflow that moves data between a database, spreadsheet and word processor.

The [R Markdown bible](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) has been released recently by Yihui Xie, JJ Allaire and Garrett Grolemund and is the go-to resource for creating [reports, presentations, dashboards, websites, books and blogs](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html) in R Markdown.

For something simpler and way more incomplete, I thought I'd expose two resources I created earlier this year to help beginners in my organisation. They're a little rough, but I included links to GitHub so you can fix them.

# Knitting Club

You can [access the 'Knitting Club' document online](https://matt-dray.github.io/knitting-club/) and find [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/knitting-club).

I presented this document in a cross-department Coffee & Coding session in April 2018. The blurb was:

> Do you have *woolly* knowledge of document creation in R? *Needle* little help? Matt Dray will drop some *purls* of wisdom and *unravel a yarn* about the *knitty*-gritty of R Markdown and the ‘knitr’ package for one-click document creation. Don’t get the *point*? If a deadline is *looming*, you’ll avoid a *stitch*-up from endless re-running of code and copy-pasting of outputs into a Word document. Come along and have *a ball*!

Ha. Ha. Ha.

# Quick R Markdown

If the Knitting Club document is too long, you can check out this shorter slide-based introduction to R Markdown below. You can also [access the slides alone](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/#1) and find [the code on GitHub](https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/).
