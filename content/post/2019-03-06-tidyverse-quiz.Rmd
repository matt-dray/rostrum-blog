# TL;DR

Can you match the tidyverse function to its package? I used [{learnr}](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) to make a ['tidyquiz'](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyquiz) to test you.

A live version is available at https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/tidyquiz/ 

To run locally and get the very latest functions:

1. `remotes::install_github("matt-dray/tidyquiz")` to install {tidyquiz} (it's a package!)
1. `library(tidyquiz)` to load it
1. `learnr::run_tutorial("tidy", package = "tidyquiz")` to open in your browser

# The problem

I saw a (probably) tongue-in-cheek tweet recently from [Ryan Timpe](https://twitter.com/ryantimpe):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hardest part about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> package development: remembering which functions are from {dplyr} and which are from {tidyr}.</p>&mdash; Ryan Timpe ðŸ¦–ðŸ“Š (@ryantimpe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryantimpe/status/1102666979909996545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2019</a></blockquote>

It's easy enough to get out of this pickle, but maybe there's a deeper problem? What if the purpose of each [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) isn't clear enough?[^wide-long] Is there too much [arbitrary jargon in the tidyverse](https://twitter.com/dnlmc/status/1105973896828866560)?

Enjoy your existential crisis. Meanwhile, I've made a little quiz to see if you can remember whether `unnest()` is from {dplyr} or {tidyr}[^unnest]. In fact, it's an interactive multi-choice test that presents you a random function from the tidyverse and challenges you to select the correct package.

# Step 0: the approach

I wanted:

1. To get a tidy dataframe of all the tidyverse package-function combos
1. A user to be presented with an interactive question about one of these tidyverse functions
1. The ability to generate a new question from within the document
1. To share this quiz easily, without a server

Read the rest of this post to see how I tackled these. Spoilers:

1. the `tidyverse_packages()` function from [{tidyverse}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html)
1. the [{learnr}](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package
1. an [`actionButton()`](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/actionbutton-demo.html) and Shiny reactivity
1. you can [put a {learnr} quiz in a package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/publishing.html) and call it from there!

# Step 1: package-function combos

The {tidyverse} package is a package that loads packages.[^meme] It's a convenient way to load the eight core packages of the tidyverse.

```{r tidyverse, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

But there's more than these core eight. To access a list of functions for each package, we first need to load all the packages. We can get a character vector of them all with `tidyverse_packages()`.

```{r tidyverse_packages}
tidy_pkgs <- tidyverse_packages() %>%  # calls character vector
  # We can protect ourselves from any rogue characters in this vector
  str_replace("\n", "") %>%  # remove newline
  str_replace(">=", "") %>%  # remove greater than or equal to
  str_replace("[:punct:]", "")  # remove punctuation

tidy_pkgs
```

We can pass this character vector to `p_load()`. This convenient function from [{pacman}]([{pacman}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html) installs and loads them all for us.

```{r p-load, warning=FALSE}
library(pacman)

p_load(
  char = tidy_pkgs,
  character.only = TRUE  # read elements of character vector
)
```

Now we can get the functions from each package by mapping over them with [{purrr}](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) and {pacman}'s `p_functions()`.

```{r tidy-funs}
tidy_funs <- tidy_pkgs %>% 
  enframe(name = NULL, value = "package") %>%  # make tibble
  mutate(
    functions = map(
      package,  # for each package...
      ~p_functions(.x, character.only = TRUE)  # ...get the functions within
    )
  ) %>% 
  unnest()  # unpack the listcol elements
```

Here's a small sample:

```{r tidy-funs-sample}
sample_n(tidy_funs, 10)  # random sample
```

Out of interest we can look at the packages with the most and fewest functions:

```{r top-bottom}
count(tidy_funs, package, sort = TRUE) %>% slice(1:5)
count(tidy_funs, package) %>% arrange(n) %>% slice(1:5)

```

Another source of confusion might be that some functions exist in multiple packages. How many functions?

```{r mask}
count(tidy_funs, functions, sort = TRUE) %>% filter(n > 1) %>% nrow()
```

Okay, we have our dataset, so let's get quizzical.

# Step 2: interactive questions with {learnr}

The [{learnr} package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) helps you turn an R Markdown document into an interactive tutorial with a little help from Shiny. One option is to create a multiple-choice question, which is exactly what we need.

I should say that {learnr} wasn't really intended for what I've done -- it's better suited to longform tutorials -- but using it means that I didn't have to write the logic for a multi-choice quiz question. Shrug. 

Having installed the package and [started a {learnr}-flavoured R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/#getting_started)[^learnr-rmd] we can create a question inside a code chunk in this form:

```{r fake-question, eval=FALSE}
quiz(
  caption = "Question 1",
  question(
    text = "What is Pokemon #399?",  # question
    answer("Bidoof"), correct = TRUE),  # right answer
    answer("Drifloom"),   # wrong
    answer("Pyukumuku"),  # wrong
    answer("Rayquaza"),   # wrong
    random_answer_order = TRUE  # answers ordered randomly
  )
)
```

But this example is hardcoded. In our case we want to replace the subject of the question and the answers any time we want to be presented with a new question.

Looks like we'll need a button for users to press to signal that they want a new question.

# Step 3: generate new questions with Shiny

Since {learnr} operates in a Shiny runtime in our R Markdown file, it's no problem to use Shiny's `actionButton()`. 

```{r, shiny-button, eval=FALSE}
actionButton("goButton", "Get Question")  # button
```

You can press the button in the app to generate a new seed base don the current time and date. The seed is then used to randomly select a new question for the user.

To make this reactive -- so that nothing will happen until the button is pressed -- we can write Shiny server code in an R Markdown chunk by setting `context="server"` in the chunk options. So here's how we get a new seed after clicking:

```{r reactive-seed, eval=FALSE}
seed <- eventReactive(
  input$goButton,
  {
    seed_temp <- as.numeric(Sys.time())
    return(seed_temp)
  }
)
```

Then our code needs to sample a row from the full dataframe of package-function combos and isolate the name of the function the user will be quizzed on. This code is within `eventReactive()` and will only trigger when the button has been activated. Second, we use `renderText()` to take the function name and paste it into a string to create our question. 

```{r, shiny-reactive, eval=FALSE}
# Set the reactive element
fun_name <- eventReactive(
  input$goButton,  # on input
  { 
    seed_val <- seed()  # the newly-generated seed value
    set.seed(seed_val)  # user-selected value is seed value
    fun_sample <- sample_n(tidy_funs, 1)  # sample a package-function combo
    fun_name <- select(fun_sample, functions) %>% pull()  # just the function name
    return(fun_name)  # return the package value
  }
)

# Set the output
# Generate a question that includes the sampled function name 
output$fun_name_out <- renderText({
  paste0("The function `", fun_name(), "` is from which tidyverse package?")
})
```

We can repeat this for getting the right answer and alter the code slightly to generate a few wrong answers. A wrong answer is selected randomly from the dataframe of tidyverse functions, but only once the correct answer and already-selected wrong answers have been removed. I've also coded it so that any package that has a function with the same name -- a conflict -- will also be removed before a 'wrong' answer is chosen. 

So rather than the hardcoded example of a multi-choice question in Step 2, our quiz question code will look like this:

```{r, reactive-question, eval=FALSE}
quiz(
  caption = "Question ",
  question(
    text = as.character(textOutput("fun_name_out")),
    answer(as.character(textOutput("ans_correct_out")), correct = TRUE),
    answer(as.character(textOutput("ans_wrong1_out"))),
    answer(as.character(textOutput("ans_wrong2_out"))),
    answer(as.character(textOutput("ans_wrong3_out"))),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

So now the text outputs will be rendered into the quiz question and this won't change until the the 'Get Question' button is clicked.

Actually, that's sort-of a lie. {learnr} remembers how it's users have performed; it saves their progress. To erase this, we need to click 'Start Over' from the menu pane to clear that memory.

# Get the code

Browse the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyquiz) and [leave an issue](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyquiz/issues) with thoughts or suggestions.

For example, it could definitely be improved if the user got a set of 10 questions that were graded to give a final mark. Maybe I'll implement this one day.

For now, give it a go and let me know if you ever find out if `drop_na()` is in {dplyr} or {tidyr}.[^drop-na]

[^unnest]: Am I tricking you? Is it actually from neither?
[^wide-long]: Seems [even Hadley gets it wrong](https://twitter.com/gerlach_d/status/1107718881970438144) sometimes.
[^meme]: The meme writes itself. Or rather, [you can do it for me](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/Yo-Dawg-Heard-You).
[^learnr-rmd]: After installing {learnr} you can go to new R Markdown > From Template > Interactive Tutorial.
