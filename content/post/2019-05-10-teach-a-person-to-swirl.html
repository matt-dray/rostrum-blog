<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>Teach people to teach other people. That seems an efficient way to maximise impact.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://swirlstats.com/">{swirl}</a> lets people learn R from within R</li>
<li><a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/">{swirlify}</a> is a package to help write Swirl courses</li>
<li>This post explains how to start a Swirl course with Swirlify</li>
<li>For example, I’ve begun <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl">Tidyswirl</a> for teaching <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> packages</li>
</ul>

<h1>Swirl</h1>
<p><a href="https://swirlstats.com/">Swirl</a> is a platform that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning with Swirl is active and your understanding is checked throughout. You can move at your own pace and download additional courses to learn about new things. And it’s free.</p>
<p>Install and load Swirl to begin and then follow the instructions printed in the console.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;swirl&quot;)
library(swirl)
swirl()</code></pre>
<p>Here’s what the first few lines of interaction with Swirl look like.</p>

<p>You’ll be given a list of courses to install, but you can also download them from elsewhere. This post is about how you can quickly create and distribute such a course.</p>
</div>
<div id="swirlify" class="section level1">
<h1>Swirlify</h1>
<p>Sean Kross and Nick Carchedi have created <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=swirlify">the {swirlify} package</a> to make course creation easy. This post covers a simple workflow to get you started, but <a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/">full Swirlify guidance</a> is available.</p>
<div id="get-up-and-running" class="section level2">
<h2>Get up and running</h2>
<p>Create a new lesson folder (‘Lesson 1’), which will be autopopulated with template files for your lesson. This will also create a new parent course folder (‘New Course’) if it doesn’t already exist.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(swirl)  # install.packages(&quot;swirl&quot;)
library(swirlify)  # install.packages(&quot;swirlify&quot;)
new_lesson(course_name = &quot;New Course&quot;, lesson_name = &quot;Lesson 1&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The following folder structure is generated:</p>
<pre><code>Working directory/
└── New_Course/
    └── Lesson_1/
        ├── customTests.R
        ├── dependson.txt
        ├── initLesson.R
        └── lesson.yaml</code></pre>
<p>The <code>lesson.yaml</code> file is the most important one. It’s basically a text file where each question is stored as text. Users advance through each of these questions when they run the lesson.</p>
<p>The lesson file can be edited directly, but we’ll focus on the built-in Swirlify Shiny app for simplicity:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>swirlify(course_name = &quot;New Course&quot;, lesson_name = &quot;Lesson 1&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The app will open the named lesson from the named course in a new browser window. On the left is where you create new questions. On the right you can see the <code>lesson.yaml</code> file itself.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-10-teach-a-person-to-swirl_files/swirlify-start.png" alt="The Swirlify Shiny GUI for writing lessons, showing a dropdown box for the lesson type, a box for writing output, the YAML code for the lesson so far, and buttons for saving and demoing the code."></p>
<p>Note the ‘Help’ tab, which tells you about the types of questions you can make, or you can see the <a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/writing.html#types_of_questions">Swirlify guidance</a>). Basically the question types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘message’ for informational text (not for questions per se)</li>
<li>‘command’ for answers that require simple R expressions as answers</li>
<li>‘numerical’ and ‘text’ for answers that are numbers or words</li>
<li>‘multiple choice’ for multiple choice (as in the figure above)</li>
<li>‘figure’ and ‘video’ for referring to media (‘video’ can take a user to any URL)</li>
<li>‘script’ for longer R expressions that requires you to write custom answer tests (this is more advanced)</li>
</ul>
<p>To build a question:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose a question type from the dropdown menu on the left</li>
<li>Fill in the text boxes (note that the answer tests box is completed for you if you type into the correct answer box and then press the ‘Make Answer Test from Correct Answer’ button)</li>
<li>Click the ‘Add Question’ button see the question added to the file (on the right hand side)</li>
<li>Click ‘Save Lesson’</li>
<li>Run <code>test_lesson()</code> to look for errors</li>
<li>Click ‘Demo Lesson’ to try it out</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/TKMV1MbB5z1iw0SbeM/giphy.gif" alt="A gif showing the process of creating a question with Swirlify's Shiny GUI, adding it to the YAML for the lesson and then saving it."></p>
<p>Continue adding questions until the lesson is complete. Then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Run <code>add_to_manifest()</code> to add the lesson to the <code>MANIFEST</code> file (it’ll be created in the course directory if it doesn’t already exist). Lessons in here are recognised as part of the course in the declared order.</li>
<li>Use <code>new_lesson()</code> to create a new one, remembering to change the <code>lesson_name</code> argument and also add this lesson to the MANIFEST as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should end up with a folder structure like this:</p>
<pre><code>Working directory/
└── New_Course/
    ├── Lesson_1/
    |   ├── customTests.R
    |   ├── dependson.txt
    |   ├── initLesson.R
    |   └── lesson.yaml
    ├─ Lesson_2/
    |   ├── customTests.R
    |   ├── dependson.txt
    |   ├── initLesson.R
    |   └── lesson.yaml
    └─ MANIFEST</code></pre>
<p>When your lessons are completed, you’re ready to share your course. Jump now to the <a href="#share">share your course</a> section or first learn some extra knowledge about <a href="#structure">lesson file structure</a>, <a href="#correct">correct answers</a> or <a href="#startup">lesson startup</a> below.</p>
</div>
<div id="extra-knowledge" class="section level2">
<h2>Extra knowledge</h2>
<p>Clearly the process of course building is more nuanced than outlined above, but you can learn more from the documentation on the <a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/index.html">Swirlify</a> site and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/swirlify/swirlify.pdf">reference manual</a>. In particular, See the <a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/structure.html">course structure</a> and <a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/writing.html">writing lessons</a> pages of the Swirlify guidance.</p>
<p>I’ll touch on three things here: lesson file structure, correct answers and lesson start-up.</p>
<div id="structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Lesson file structure</h3>
<p>The lesson file is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>, which is basically a special form of plain text. Questions appear as separate blocks of text that start with a hyphen and a question type (class) declaration, followed by further arguments on new indented lines.</p>
<p>The first block is always <code>Class: meta</code> and provides basic information about the file, like your name and the lesson name. Another simple one is <code>Class: text</code> to which you supply only one more argument, the <code>Output</code>, which is text to display to the user.</p>
<pre><code>- Class: text
  Output: Did I mention chocolate hobnobs are great?</code></pre>
<p>There are actually three ways to add questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the Shiny app, as outlined earlier in this post.</li>
<li>By using the <code>wq_*()</code> family of functions to add questions to the active lesson – <code>wq_message(output = "Text here")</code> adds informative text, for example.</li>
<li>By writing directly into the YAML file.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s more on questions classes and how to write them <a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/writing.html#types-of-questions">in the Swirlify guidance</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="correct" class="section level3">
<h3>Correct answers</h3>
<p>How are answers encoded and checked in <code>lesson.yaml</code>? Consider the YAML for this question:</p>
<pre><code>- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use mean() to calculate the mean of the numbers 1 to 5.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(1:5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr=&#39;mean(1:5&#39;))
  Hint: Use the form x:y to provide numbers to mean().</code></pre>
<p>So <code>CorrectAnswer</code> is where you provide the correct answer (!). This line will be run if the user chooses to <code>skip()</code> the question. <code>AnswerTests</code> is, however, what the user’s input will actually be evaluated against. It uses the <code>omnitest</code> function to compare the correct expression (<code>correctExpr</code>) to the user’s answer.</p>
<p>But often there’s more than one way to answer. The <code>any_of_exprs()</code> function should be used in this case.</p>
<pre><code>- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use mean() to calculate the mean of the numbers 1 to 5.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(1:5)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs(&#39;mean(1:5)&#39;, &#39;mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))&#39;)
  Hint: You can use the form x:y or c(x, y) to provide numbers to mean().</code></pre>
<p>There’s more on answer testing <a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/writing.html#answer-testing">in the Swirlify guidance</a>, including how to write custom answer tests.</p>
</div>
<div id="startup" class="section level3">
<h3>Lesson start-up</h3>
<p>Anything in the <code>initLesson.R</code> file will be run when the lesson is loaded. You can create objects and refer to them in your questions. For example, you could add a data frame:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>biscuits &lt;- data.frame(
  name = c(&quot;Chocolate hobnob&quot;, &quot;Digestive&quot;, &quot;Custard cream&quot;),
  rating = c(10, 5, 7) 
)</code></pre>
<p>You could then ask in <code>lesson.yaml</code> something like:</p>
<pre><code>- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use index notation to subset for biscuits rated over 5.
  CorrectAnswer: biscuits[biscuits$rating &gt; 5, ]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr=&#39;biscuits[, biscuits$rating &gt; 5]&#39;)
  Hint: Remember the indexing format dataframe[rows, columns].</code></pre>
<p>The data frame was loaded on start-up, so the user can interact with it to answer the question.</p>
<p>You can also add data sets to the lesson folder and read them into the user’s environment via the <code>initLesson.R</code> file. See the Swirlify <a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/structure.html#including-data">guidance on including data</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="share" class="section level2">
<h2>Share your course</h2>
<p>Congratulations. You’re ready to share your course.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/sharing.html">several ways to do this</a>. It’s easiest for learners to use Swirl’s <code>swirl::install_course_*()</code> functions to install courses from:</p>
<ul>
<li>a GitHub repo</li>
<li>a zip file stored on DropBox, Google Drive, or some URL</li>
<li>a course folder—zipped or not—-downloaded locally on their machine</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also compress your course to a single <code>.swc</code> file with <code>compress_course()</code> and raise a pull request for it to be hosted on the <a href="http://swirlstats.com/scn/">Swirl Course Network</a>. It can be downloaded from there with <code>install_course()</code>.</p>
<p>Swirl is strengthened by having a greater number and range of courses.</p>

<div id="plea" class="section level1">
<h1>Plea</h1>
<p>The R community is large and friendly. Swirl helps people learn. It would be great to see more courses being made. Consider making one to teach your colleagues about common R tasks in your department, for example.</p>
