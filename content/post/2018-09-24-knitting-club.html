<h1>RAP and the rise of reproducibility</h1>
<p>The UK government has got better at producing statistical reports in a reproducible way. A turning point was the creation of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) – a method for making releases easier to recreate, test and audit. <a href="https://www.machinegurning.com/posts/">Matthews Upson and Gregory</a> of <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/">Government Digital Service</a> (GDS) have <a href="https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/">described</a> and <a href="https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/">enshrined</a> this process and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/">enabled</a> others to <a href="https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/11/27/transforming-the-process-of-producing-official-statistics/">continue its spread</a>.</p>
<p>One useful and accessible tool for reproducibility is <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>, which allows you to execute R code inside your document and ‘knit’ it into a readable report. You can re-run the code, or alter the parameters and re-knit it without stress. This is much faster and less error-prone versus a workflow that moves data between a database, spreadsheet and word processor.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/">R Markdown bible</a> has been released recently by Yihui Xie, JJ Allaire and Garrett Grolemund and is the go-to resource for creating <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html">reports, presentations, dashboards, websites, books and blogs</a> in R Markdown.</p>
<p>For something simpler and way more incomplete, I thought I’d expose two resources I created earlier this year to help beginners in my organisation. They’re a little rough, but I included links to GitHub so you can fix them.</p>

<h1>Knitting Club</h1>
<p>You can <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/knitting-club/">access the ‘Knitting Club’ document online</a> and find <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/knitting-club">the code on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I presented this document in a cross-department Coffee &amp; Coding session in April 2018. The blurb was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have <em>woolly</em> knowledge of document creation in R? <em>Needle</em> little help? Matt Dray will drop some <em>purls</em> of wisdom and <em>unravel a yarn</em> about the <em>knitty</em>-gritty of R Markdown and the ‘knitr’ package for one-click document creation. Don’t get the <em>point</em>? If a deadline is <em>looming</em>, you’ll avoid a <em>stitch</em>-up from endless re-running of code and copy-pasting of outputs into a Word document. Come along and have <em>a ball</em>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha. Ha. Ha.</p>

<h1>Quick R Markdown</h1>
<p>If the Knitting Club document is too long, you can check out this shorter slide-based introduction to R Markdown below. You can also <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/#1">access the slides alone</a> and find <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/quick-rmd/">the code on GitHub</a>.</p>
