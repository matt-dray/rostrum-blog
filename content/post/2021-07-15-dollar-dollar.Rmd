# tl;dr 

R's `$` symbol is part of an international ruse. I wrote a function so you can use your local currency as a dataframe accessor instead.

# Pull the wool from your eyes

You're an R user, so you'll know how to access the contents of a quoted column name from a dataframe with square-bracket notation.

```{r square-brackets}
mtcars[["cyl"]]
```

The dollar symbol (`$`) does the same thing, of course, in the form `dataframe$column`.

```{r usd-infix}
mtcars$cyl
```

But, like basically everything in R, it's just a function. 

So you can also use it in the 'traditional way' by passing the dataframe and column name to it as arguments inside brackets. You'll need to use backticks though, because function names can't start with symbols or numbers.

```{r usd-fn}
`$`(mtcars, cyl)
```

# Wake up sheeple

But why the dollar symbol? Something something 'compatability with S'. 

Or perhaps a more sinister ploy by [R's original developers, Ihaka and Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#History)? 

Like a KIWI CONSPIRACY to raise awareness of the NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR (NZD) and INFLUENCE currency markets? I'm just asking the question.[^sorry]

So, I'm giving you the FREEDOM to assign the functionality of the dollar symbol to another currency symbol, like, oh, I don't know, the pound sterling symbol (`£`), as a completely random example.

```{r gbp-usd}
`£` <- `$`
`£`(mtcars, cyl)
```

You can't use it in the `dataframe$column` form, however. That kind of behaviour is reserved for special symbols in R.[^recompile]

```{r gbp-infix-fail, error=TRUE}
mtcars£cyl
```

Shame. R has a little quirk that will make this work though. Sort of. 

You can make a function do this by putting it between percentage symbols (`%`). This is called [an 'infix operator'](https://colinfay.me/playing-r-infix-functions/) and you may have seen [the {magrittr} pipe (`%>%`)](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) as one example. 

```{r gbp-infix-success}
`%£%` <- `$`
mtcars %£% cyl
```

As a complete coincidence, I live in Great Britain (GB) where we use pound sterling (`£`, or 'GBP'). 

R also knows where I live (another conspiracy?).

```{r get-locale}
Sys.getlocale()
```

This string is R's way of keeping track of the location-specific information that influences stuff like the language of error messages.

You can specify different locales for different things. Here's my locale for 'monetary' parameters, for example.

```{r get-locale-monetary}
Sys.getlocale(category = "LC_MONETARY")
```

That particular value impacts parameters like the punctuation mark used for decimals and, wouldn't you know it, the symbol used for currency.

```{r get-conv}
Sys.localeconv()
```

# Mutton dressed as lamb

So, that means I can write you a function that gets the currency symbol for your locale and assigns to it the functionality of the dollar symbol, naturally.

I've used a bit of a trick[^trick] here. You can't use a string on the left-hand side of the assignment operator, but you can build an R expression as a string and evaluate a parsed version of it (with some help from {rlang} in my example).

```{r fn-def}
copy_dollar <- function() {
  
  # Get currency symbol for locale
  currency <- Sys.localeconv()[["currency_symbol"]]
  
  # Report the locale
  if (currency == "$") stop("KIWI CONSPIRATOR!")
  locale <- Sys.getlocale(category = "LC_MONETARY")
  cat(paste0("Your monetary locale is '", locale, "'\n"))
  
  # Generate and evaluate strings
  expr_fn <- paste0("`", currency, "` <<- `$`")
  expr_in <- paste0("`%", currency, "%` <<- `$`")
  eval(rlang::parse_expr(expr_fn ))  # function form
  eval(rlang::parse_expr(expr_in))   # infix form
  
  # Report to user
  cat(
    paste0("Try `", currency, "`(df, col) and df`%", currency, "%`col\n")
  )
  
}
```

Freeeedooooom.

```{r run-fn-gb}
copy_dollar()
```

We got a couple of messages[^eng] to confirm our location and let us know how we can use the new currency-symbol functions.

And we can see these in the global environment.

```{r check-env}
ls()
```

And we can prove that GBP equals NZD, at least as a function for accessing columns of a dataframe.

```{r gbp-proof}
all(
  mtcars %£% cyl == mtcars$cyl,
  `£`(mtcars, cyl) == `$`(mtcars, cyl)
)
```

Okay, works for my location. What about when I'm competing in Japan at the Olympics[^golf]? Well, I can change the monetary locale.

```{r set-locale-jp}
Sys.setlocale("LC_MONETARY", "ja_JP.UTF-8")
Sys.localeconv()
```

So now you can see the yen symbol (`¥`) as the named currency value for this locale. And you can use the function to activate it for use as a data accessor.

```{r run-fn-jp}
copy_dollar()
`¥`(mtcars, cyl)
```

Oh, and there's no point trying to do this if your locale already uses the dollar for currency. I know you want as many dollars as possible, but don't be greedy.

```{r set-locale-us, error=TRUE}
Sys.setlocale("LC_MONETARY", locale = "en_NZ.UTF-8")
copy_dollar()
```

I'll reset my settings to the motherland to prevent any accidental borking.

```{r reset-locale-gb}
Sys.setlocale(locale = "en_GB.UTF-8")
```

Nothing ever goes wrong in Britain.

# Separate your sheep from your goats

While you go and adjust your locale in an act of defiance, be on the lookout for the next New Zealander conspiracy. 

I heard that they want to replace the ampersand (`&`) symbol in R version 5 with `NEWZEAL&`, so stay on your toes.

Hang on...

I think I used sheep-related phrases in all the section titles of this post. And aren't there like [10 sheep per person in New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_farming_in_New_Zealand)? 

They've got to me already!

[^sorry]: With apologies to all the lovely people of New Zealand.
[^trick]: 'Illusions, Michael.'
[^recompile]: Yep, you could probably change this in the R source code and recompile it, but... effort.
[^golf]: I heard that [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) is one of the new sports on display this year?
[^eng]: Yes, I'm aware I've written the messages in English only. I can only break down one international barrier at once, pal.
