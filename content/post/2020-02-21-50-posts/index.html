<div id="tldr" class="section level1">
<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>There are many reasons to start that R blog you’ve been thinking about. First and foremost, do it for you.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-blog" class="section level1">
<h1>Why blog?</h1>
<p>I’ve stumbled into writing 50 posts on this blog. There was no plan. I have no strategy. It’s working so far.</p>
<p>My only regret was not starting sooner. How would I convince me-from-the-past?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It’s your <a href="#reference-library" target="_blank">reference library</a></li>
<li>It only has to be <a href="#good-enough" target="_blank">good enough</a></li>
<li>There are others <a href="#like-you" target="_blank">like you</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll explain.</p>
<div id="reference-library" class="section level2">
<h2>1. It’s your reference library</h2>
<p>I forget everything. That’s especially true for code.</p>
<p>Keeping a written record of what you’ve learnt is a good way of storing that information outside of your head.</p>
<p>Writing a narrative will help explain the code and make sure you understand it in your own words. That’ll make it easier to pick up later.</p>
<p>It helps if what you write is available to you everywhere all the time as well. It needs to be open and on the internet.</p>
<p>Proof is in the pudding: I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve referred back to my own posts on <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/11/01/usethis/" target="_blank">creating an R package</a>, <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/03/04/polite-webscrape/" target="_blank">web scraping</a> and <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/04/07/fix-leaky-pipes/" target="_blank">fixing leaky pipes</a>, for example.</p>
<p>For me, ‘blog or it didn’t happen’ is probably a good mantra.</p>
</div>
<div id="good-enough" class="section level2">
<h2>2. It only has to be good enough</h2>
<p>Perfectionism is cruel and returns are diminishing. I sat on a thesis for months longer than I should have. Did it improve in that time? Marginally. Did it affect the outcome? Not really.</p>
<p>The spell was broken when someone told me that ‘it only has to be good enough’.</p>
<p>You have finite time and too much stuff to do, so maybe efficiency should be the focus. There’s a real, obtainable, minimum level of effort that will get you to a thing that works.</p>
<p>Consider that in the context of writing blog posts <em>for yourself</em>. They only have to be good enough to remind <em>you</em> of what you did so you can redo the thing at some point in the future.</p>
<p>This will also encourage you to keep it short and simple. You’re far more likely to finish it that way. Write a follow-up later if you want to.</p>
</div>
<div id="like-you" class="section level2">
<h2>3. There are others like you</h2>
<p>R solves so many problems efficiently and reproducibly. It’s particularly needed in the public sector, where I work, to build trust, reduce costs and do things quicker. I think there are plenty of people in this boat; why else are you reading this?</p>
<p>I’m not a ‘programmer’, however. I wasn’t specifically trained in statistics. I definitely didn’t ‘get’ R at first and I’m probably never going to be an ‘expert’. So I might as well keep learning and sharing.</p>
<p>Being visible with your learning means that others can help you and give you ideas. Being open might even encourage other learners to get involved, too.</p>
<p>Consider people like <a href="https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand" target="_blank">Sharla Gelfand</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dgkeyes" target="_blank">David Keyes</a> (of <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/" target="_blank">R for the Rest of Us</a>), who are visible on Twitter and unafraid of asking questions. One of R’s unique selling points is its friendly community. Make the most of it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you don’t owe anything to anyone. But there are other people like you. Why not learn in the open and help lower the barrier to entry?</p>

<div id="more-reasons" class="section level1">
<h1>More reasons</h1>
<p>I think this would be enough to convince me-from-the-past, but maybe it’s not enough for you.</p>
<p>After I started writing this I came across <a href="https://twitter.com/rlbarter" target="_blank">Rebecca Barter</a>’s nice talk on <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/rebecca-barter" target="_blank">Becoming an R Blogger</a> at the recent RStudio Conference. Rebecca has also written <a href="http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2020-02-03_blogger/" target="_blank">a supporting blog post</a> with some helpful information.</p>
<p>In particular, Rebecca mentions some reasons beyond ‘doing it for yourself’, like building up a portfolio of work, gaining exposure and squeezing some productivity into your procrastination. All extremely valid.</p>
<p>Try it and let me know how it goes.</p>
