The [GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) API--on which [the {skyphone} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/skyphone) depends--stopped responding (i.e. it 404s) soon after this post was published. I may fix {skyphone} in future [to work via {gh} instead](https://gh.r-lib.org/); feel free to contribute.

# tl;dr

I made [the R package {skyphone}](https://github.com/matt-dray/skyphone) to get GitHub contributions data from [GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) and sonify it.

# Reach for the skyline

[Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) is an online curio from GitHub that lets you input a user's name and get a 3D rendering of that user's contributions to the platform. You can even download the object to 3D print it, I guess?

It's basically the contributions heatmap from your profile, but with a bonus third dimension. And it's on a plinth! That spins! And it's happening inside Tron!

Why does it exist? Think Spotify Wrapped---a summary of users' listening habits at the end of each year[^bot]---which results in lots of social-media shares and free marketing.[^irony] 

# Sounds of the city

[I wrote recently](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/02/02/sonify-covid/) about expressing a year's worth of COVID-19 data in audio form. This process, called sonification, is made simple in R thanks to [the {sonify} package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sonify/index.html).

Obviously it's far lower stakes, but there's no reason we can't take a user's GitHub contributions data and sonify that too.[^why] Is that useful? Maybe. Is it it much effort? Not really. 

It [turns out](https://den.dev/blog/get-github-contributions-api/) that Skyline has a simple API. Provide a URL in this form to get a JSON back:

```
https://skyline.github.com/api/contributions?username=username&year=2020
```

This lends itself nicely to a simple R function that grabs the data for a given user in a given year. The counts over time can then be passed to sonification and plotting functions.

So... [{skyphone}](https://github.com/matt-dray/skyphone).

# Pick up the {skyphone}

You can install the package from GitHub. It's never going on CRAN.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/skyphone")
```

There's three functions: one to get the data, one to sonify it, and one to plot it. All functions are prefaced by `sky_` for easy tab completion.

## Get a dial tone

The `sky_get()` function takes a username and a year, which are used to generate an API string. The function fetches and tidies the resulting JSON from the call, generating a tidy tibble with a row of contributions per day.

```{r}
library(skyphone)
md <- sky_get(user = "matt-dray", year = 2020)
md
```
```
## # A tibble: 366 x 6
##    user       year  week   day date       count
##    <chr>     <int> <int> <int> <date>     <int>
##  1 matt-dray  2020     1     1 2020-01-01     5
##  2 matt-dray  2020     1     2 2020-01-02     5
##  3 matt-dray  2020     1     3 2020-01-03     8
##  4 matt-dray  2020     1     4 2020-01-04     3
##  5 matt-dray  2020     2     5 2020-01-05     0
##  6 matt-dray  2020     2     6 2020-01-06     7
##  7 matt-dray  2020     2     7 2020-01-07    10
##  8 matt-dray  2020     2     8 2020-01-08     2
##  9 matt-dray  2020     2     9 2020-01-09     6
## 10 matt-dray  2020     2    10 2020-01-10     0
## # â€¦ with 356 more rows
```

By itself, this is a useful little function for the casual R user who doesn't want to handle the JSON.

## Hello?

The output from `sky_get()` can be passed to `sky_sonify()`, which converts the count of contributions over time to audio form: a WaveMC object.

```{r}
sky_sonify(md, play = FALSE)
```
```
## 
## WaveMC Object
##  Number of Samples:      220500
##  Duration (seconds):     5
##  Samplingrate (Hertz):   44100
##  Number of channels:     2
##  PCM (integer format):   TRUE
##  Bit (8/16/24/32/64):    16
```

If you set the `play` argument to `TRUE` then you will hear the sonified result over your speakers. You can also provide a directory path to the `out_dir` argument to save the audio file as a .wav to a specified location.

The data I collected sound like this:

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/skyphone/skyphone_matt-dray_2020.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

For amusement's sake, 2016 is the year I joined GitHub and, well, that's all that happened. We can fetch that year with `sky_get()` and then pipe that into `sky_sonify()`. I've saved the output file to my dekstop in this example.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(magrittr)  # to demo pipes in {skyphone}

sky_get("matt-dray", 2016) %>% 
  sky_sonify(play = FALSE, out_dir = "~/Desktop")
```

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/skyphone/skyphone_matt-dray_2016.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

Did you hear the momentous day on April 2?

## Videophone

We've seen what a 3D skyline plot looks like; what about a good old fashioned 2D chart?

There's a simple, opinionated plotting function in the package that you are welcome to use, called `sky_plot()`. Again, you can pass the earlier object from `sky_get()`.

```{r plot, fig.alt="A bar chart of contributions to GitHub in 2020 by user matt-dray, which peaks in the summer months."}
p <- sky_plot(md)
p
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-02-20-skyphone_files/figure-html/plot-1.png" alt="A bar chart of contributions to GitHub in 2020 by user matt-dray, which peaks in the summer months." width="100%"/>
</div>

See how this looks like a skyline, but in 2D this time? Admittedly the 'buildings' are a little weird. [Radio towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_structures)? Use your imagination, buddy.

For a final flourish, we can apply a ridiculous [vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave)-inspired theme to the plot. This retro aesthetic has been rinsed to death of late, so naturally it was used in the Skyline interface.[^fellow]

[The {vapoRwave} package](https://github.com/moldach/vapoRwave) has a number of themes we can choose. 

```{r plot-vaporwave, fig.alt="A bar chart of contributions to GitHub in 2020 by user matt-dray, using a 'vaporwave' aesthetic for its colours and fonts."}
# remotes::install_github("moldach/vapoRwave")
library(vapoRwave)
p + new_retro()
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-02-20-skyphone_files/figure-html/plot-vaporwave-1.png" alt="A bar chart of contributions to GitHub in 2020 by user matt-dray, using a 'vaporwave' aesthetic for its colours and fonts." width="100%"/>
</div>

So... that's it. But do join me in waiting for the first hospital admission of someone who trod on their 3D-printed skyline. It's the risk you take.
