<h2>Reaping with <code>rvest</code></h2>
<p>Ah, salutations, and welcome to this blog post about polite web scraping. Please do come in. I’ll take your coat. How are you? Would you like a cup of tea? Oh, I insist!</p>
<p>Speaking of tea, perhaps you’d care to join me in genial conversation about it. Where to begin? Let’s draw inspiration from popular posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/">the Tea subreddit of Reddit</a>. I’ll fetch the post titles using <a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org/">the {rvest} package</a> from Hadley Wickham and get the correct CSS selector using <a href="https://selectorgadget.com/">SelectorGadget</a> by Andrew Cantino and Kyle Maxwell.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load some packages we need
library(rvest)  # scrape a site
library(dplyr)  # data manipulation

# CSS for post titles found using SelectorGadget
# (This is a bit of an odd one)
css_select &lt;- &quot;._3wqmjmv3tb_k-PROt7qFZe ._eYtD2XCVieq6emjKBH3m&quot;

# Scrape a specific named page
tea_scrape &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tea&quot;) %&gt;%  # read the page
  html_nodes(css = css_select) %&gt;%  # read post titles
  html_text()  # convert to text

print(tea_scrape)</code></pre>

<p>That’ll provide us with some conversational fodder, wot wot.</p>
</div>
<div id="it-costs-nothing-to-be-polite" class="section level2">
<h2>It costs nothing to be polite</h2>
<p>Mercy! I failed to doff adequately my cap before entering the website! They must take me for some sort of street urchin.</p>
<p>Forgive me. Perhaps you’ll allow me to show you a more respectful method via <a href="https://www.github.com/dmi3kno/polite/">the {polite} package</a> in development from the esteemed gentleman <a href="https://twitter.com/dmi3k">Dmytro Perepolkin</a>? An excellent way ‘to promote responsible web etiquette’.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-reverential-bow" class="section level2">
<h2>A reverential bow()</h2>
<p>Perhaps the website owners don’t want people to keep barging in willy-nilly without so much as a ‘ahoy-hoy’.</p>
<p>We should identify ourselves and our intent with a humble <code>bow()</code>. We can expect a curt but informative response from the site—via its <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html">robots.txt file</a>—that tells us where we can visit and how frequently.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># remotes::install_github(&quot;dmi3kno/polite&quot;)  # to install
library(polite)  # respectful webscraping

# Make our intentions known to the website
reddit_bow &lt;- bow(
  url = &quot;https://www.reddit.com/&quot;,  # base URL
  user_agent = &quot;M Dray &lt;https://rostrum.blog&gt;&quot;,  # identify ourselves
  force = TRUE
)

print(reddit_bow)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &lt;polite session&gt; https://www.reddit.com/
##      User-agent: M Dray &lt;https://rostrum.blog&gt;
##      robots.txt: 32 rules are defined for 4 bots
##     Crawl delay: 5 sec
##   The path is scrapable for this user-agent</code></pre>
<p>Super-duper. The (literal) bottom line is that we’re allowed to scrape. The website does have 32 rules to stop unruly behaviour though, and even calls out four very naughty bots that are obviously not very polite. We’re invited to give a five-second delay between requests to allow for maximum respect.</p>
</div>
<div id="give-a-nod" class="section level2">
<h2>Give a nod()</h2>
<p>Ahem, conversation appears to be wearing a little thin; perhaps I can interest you by widening the remit of our chitchat? Rather than merely iterating though subpages of the same subreddit, we can visit the front pages of a few different subreddits. Let’s celebrate the small failures and triumphs of being British; a classic topic of polite conversation in Britain.</p>
<p>We’ve already given a <code>bow()</code> and made out intentions clear; a knowing <code>nod()</code> will be sufficient for the next steps. Here’s a little function to <code>nod()</code> to the site each time we iterate over a vector of subreddit names. Our gentlemanly agreement remains intact from our earlier <code>bow()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr)  # functional programming tools
library(tidyr)  # tidy-up data structure

get_posts &lt;- function(subreddit_name, bow = reddit_bow, css_select){
  
  # 1. Agree modification of session path with host
  session &lt;- nod(
    bow = bow,
    path = paste0(&quot;r/&quot;, subreddit_name)
  )
  
  # 2. Scrape the page from the new path
  scraped_page &lt;- scrape(session)
  
  # 3. Extract from xpath on the altered URL
  node_result &lt;- html_nodes(
    scraped_page,
    css = css_select
  )
  
  # 4. Render result as text
  text_result &lt;- html_text(node_result)
  
  # 5. Return the text value
  return(text_result)
  
}</code></pre>
<p>Smashing. Care to join me in applying this function over a vector of subreddit names? Tally ho.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># A vector of subreddits to iterate over
subreddits &lt;- set_names(
  c(&quot;BritishProblems&quot;, &quot;BritishSuccess&quot;)
)

top_posts &lt;- map_df(

<p>Bravo, what excellent manners we’ve demonstrated. You can also iterate over different query strings – for example if your target website displays information over several subpages – with the <code>params</code> argument of the <code>scrape()</code> function.</p>
<p>Oh, you have to leave? No, no, you haven’t overstayed your welcome! It was truly marvellous to see you. Don’t forget your brolly, old chap, and don’t forget to print the session info for this post. Pip pip!</p>
