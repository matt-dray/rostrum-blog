# \#CottonViz 

The [Young Statistician's Section (YSS)](https://statsyss.wordpress.com/) of the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/) (RSS) has [challenged people](https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/news-publications/2021/section-group-reports/mary-eleanor-spear-dataviz-competition-for-childre/) to recreate[^recreate] or remix [Mary Eleanor Spear's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Eleanor_Spear) visualisation of cotton supplies in the United States in the 1940s:[^spear] 

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-06-08-recreate-spear_files/4_original.jpg" alt="Mary Eleanor Spear's original plot of cotton supplies in 1940s USA. On the left is a line plot showing that carry-over stocks fell from 1942 to 1948, while consumption dropped slightly and exports rose slightly. A bar plot to the right shows the same data as a stacked bar chart. There are titles and captions around the plots." width="100%"/>
</div>

I thought it would be interesting to recreate it using only R's built-in base graphics. This might be a nice demo of zero-dependency plotting for R users who are more familiar with {ggplot2}.[^base]

Long-story short, here's what popped out at the end of my scripting:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-06-08-recreate-spear_files/3_final.png" alt="A recreation of Spear's original plot, with line plot, bar plot, labels and titles. It's not an identical match. The title font is not the same, for example." width="100%"/>
</div>

It's certainly not an identical match to the original, but it gets most of the way there.[^mismatch]

You can find the code for this in [a GitHub Gist](https://www.ffonts.net/Hussar-Bold-Condensed.font), or read on.

The rest of this post is a walkthrough of the code used to create the final output. It's in five sections: (1) [set-up](#setup), (2) [line plot](#lineplot), (3) [bar plot](#barplot), (4) [margin labels](#marginlabels) and (5) [saving](#saving), with a closing section reflecting on tricky parts and potential improvements.

# 1. Set-up {#setup}

## Data

The dataset is [available to download](https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/news-publications/2021/section-group-reports/mary-eleanor-spear-dataviz-competition-for-childre/) from the RSS website, but it's small enough that I can just recreate it here.

```{r eval=TRUE}
cotton <- data.frame(
  Year = 1942:1948,
  `US consumption` = c(11160, 9993,  9693,  9423,  10072, 9374,  7833),
  Exports          = c(1480,  1139,  2007,  3613,  3545,  1968,  4785),
  Stocks           = c(10657, 10744, 11164, 7326,  2530,  3080,  5283),
  `Total supply`   = c(23297, 21876, 22864, 20362, 16147, 14422, 17901),
  check.names = FALSE  # allows for spaces in variable names
)
```

I've maintained the same 

## Fonts

I've used two font families that weren't pre-installed on my system:

* [Routed Gothic](https://webonastick.com/fonts/routed-gothic/) for the majority of the text (a very close match for the general text of the plot)
* [Hussar Bold Condensed](https://www.ffonts.net/Hussar-Bold-Condensed.font) for the title (a not-that-great match for the main title)

It was sufficient for me to install these fonts on my system (macOS Big Sur running R v4.0.5) and invoke them by name, as you'll see through the rest of this walkthrough. Your mileage may vary.

## Constants

I've set a few values as objects so they can be reused and changed more easily without having to copy-paste in the body of the scrip. Note that I've used the convention here that constants are `ALL_CAPS`, so they're easier to spot in the plotting code.

<details><summary>Click for constants (I hid this because it's dull)</summary>
```{r eval=TRUE}
# Constants: general
CEX       <- 0.8
YDIV      <- 1000
BLACK     <- "black"
WHITE     <- "white"
YTICK_LEN <- 0.03
XTICK_LEN <- 0.02

# Constants: lineplot (LP)
LP_YLIM      <- c(0, 12)
LP_WIDTH     <- 3
LP_YTICK_SEQ <- seq(2, 10, 2)
LP_YLAB_SEQ  <- seq(0, 12, 2)

# Constants: barplot (BP)
BP_YLIM        <- c(0, 25)
BP_YTICK_SEQ   <- seq(5, 20, 5)
BP_YLAB_SEQ    <- seq(0, 25, 5)
BP_SPACE       <- 0.5
BP_HATCH_ANGLE <- 45
BP_HATCH_HI    <- 25
BP_HATCH_MID   <- 22
BP_HATCH_LO    <- 12
```
</details>

## Start a graphics device

With base plotting you first open a new 'device' so that your plotting calls can be captured. You specify things here like the write path and dimensions. When you've finished your plotting code, you run `dev.off()` to close the device and save the output.

```{r}
png(
  "~/Desktop/cottonviz.png",  # set to a path of your choice
  width  = 20,
  height = 12.2,
  units  = "cm",
  res    = 1200
)
```

You can think of this as setting up a canvas and then you're going to layer plot objects over the top of it. Beware: things like units and placement of elements will be related to the `height` and `width` that you've declared here. That means you shouldn't rely on the graphics windows opened by R or RStudio when previewing the final output; you should rely only on a saved output.

## Plotting parameters

With base R you can set various `par()`ameters that apply to your plot as a whole. The chart we're recreating is one row of two plots, so we can use `mfrow = c(1, 2)`, for example. We can also set some global things like the font family.

```{r}
# Set plotting parameters
par(
  mgp = c(0, 0.2, 0),  # gap to tick labels
  mar = c(3, 2, 4, 1),  # margins
  mfrow = c(1, 2),  # plot layout
  ann = FALSE,  # annotation
  cex.axis = CEX,  # font size
  family = "Routed Gothic"  # font family
)
```

I've selected '[Routed Gothic](https://webonastick.com/fonts/routed-gothic/)' as the font family and I think it's a great match. It's based on the Leroy lettering set that was often used for hand-labelling technical drawings.

# 2. Line plot {#lineplot}

So, here's the first 'hack'. I'm going to set up a 'fake' scatter plot with no content and then we're going to add content to it sequentially. This provides the correct plot dimensions to which we can add bespoke details.

```{r}
# Dummy x-y scatter plot
plot(
  x = cotton$Year,
  y = cotton$`US consumption` / YDIV,  # i.e. divide by 1000
  axes = FALSE,  # no axes
  pch = "",   # expunge axes/points
  ylim = LP_YLIM,  # y-axis min/max limits
  xaxs = "i",  # set 'absolute origin' on x-axis
  yaxs = "i"   # set 'absolute origin' on y-axis
)
```

Note the use of `yaxs` and `xaxs = "i"` which ensures that the axis limits are exactly at the minimum and maximum values for the axis (e.g. it forces [0,0] to be in the extreme lower-left.)

Now we can build up the plot axes with manual calls to `axis()`. 

In short, we supply to `axis()` the `side` (`1` is the x-axis) and the locations for things like `labels` and `tck` (ticks). I've used separate calls for ticks and labels on the primary y-axis (`side = 2`) because the min and max values (0 and 12) are actually set just above and below the ticks. I've copied the primary y-axis call for a secondary y-axis (`side = 4`) too.

```{r}
# Manual x-axis
axis(
  side = 1,
  at = 1942:1948,
  labels = c(1942, paste0("'", 43:48)),  # i.e. 1942, '43, '44, etc
  tck = XTICK_LEN,  # tick length
  col = WHITE,  # i.e. axis isn't visible
  col.ticks = BLACK  # i.e. axis ticks are visible
)

# Manual y-axis (just ticks)
axis(
  side = 2,
  at = LP_YTICK_SEQ,  # no ticks needed for origin/max
  labels = FALSE, 
  tck = YTICK_LEN, 
  col = WHITE,
  col.ticks = BLACK
)

# Manual y-axis (just labels)
axis(
  side = 2,
  at = c(0.2, LP_YTICK_SEQ, 11.8),  # min/max labels above/below tick
  labels = LP_YLAB_SEQ, 
  las = 1,
  tck = 0,
  col = WHITE, 
  col.ticks = BLACK
)

# Manual secondary y-axis (just ticks)
axis(
  side = 4,
  at = LP_YTICK_SEQ,
  labels = FALSE,
  tck = YTICK_LEN,
  col = WHITE,
  col.ticks = BLACK
)
```

I don't know of a way to make the y-axis label appear horizontally at the top of the axis, so I've used `mtext()` to place a label in the margin (hence the 'm' in `mtext`) space above the plot.

```{r}
# Y-axis label: horizontal at top of axis
mtext("Millions of Boles", side = 3, cex = CEX - 0.1, adj = -0.07)
```

This gives us all the ticks and labels, but we're missing the axes themselves. Spear used a box around the whole plot; you can do this in R with a call to `box()`.

```{r}
# Bounding box around plot boundary
box()
```

Here's what the plot looks like at this point:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-06-08-recreate-spear_files/1_lp_1.png" alt="The recreated plot in progress: the axes and labels of the lineplot are the only thing added to the plotting area." width="100%"/>
</div>

Next we need to actually plot some data! We can use `mapply()` to pass the parameters to a custom function that contains calls to `lines()` and `text()`, which lay down the trace and label for each group iteratively.

```{r}
# Generate lines and labels for each group iteratively
mapply(
  function(type, lty, x, y, label) { 
    lines(cotton$Year, cotton[[type]] / YDIV, lty = lty, lwd = LP_WIDTH)
    text(x, y, label, cex = CEX)
  },
  type = c("US consumption", "Exports", "Stocks"),
  lty = c("solid", "longdash", "dashed"),
  x = c(1946.5, 1943.7, 1946.2), 
  y = c(11, 3.2, 6.8),
  label = c("U. S. Consumption", "Exports", "Carry â€“ over\nstocks")
)
```

I would normally do iterative things with the `map()` family of functions from [the {purrr} package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) By Lionel Henry and Hadley Wickham, so I welcome suggestions on appropriate use of the various base `*apply()` functions in this scenario.

Finally we can add the arrows that point to the lines from the labels. Base R has a handy `arrows()` function to which you supply start and end coordinates and parameters for the arrowhead. I used an advanced-coder technique called 'trial-and-error' for this.

```{r}
# Add arrows from labels to lines
arrows(
  x0 = c(1945.4, 1944.2, 1945.5),  # Consumption, Exports, Stocks
  y0 = c(10.8, 3.2, 7.1),
  x1 = c(1945, 1944.4, 1945.2),
  y1 = c(9.6, 3, 6.8),
  angle = 12,  # pointy-ness
  length = 0.07  # arrowhead length
)
```

Excellent, that's the line plot completed:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-06-08-recreate-spear_files/1_lp_2.png" alt="The recreated plot in progress: the line plot has axes, labels, data and arrows." width="100%"/>
</div>

# 3. Bar plot {#barplot}

The `barplot()` function is a little different to the `plot()` function.

It doesn't take the data as `x` and `y` arguments; we can instead pass it a single object that contains our data with each column corresponding to columns in the plot. 

```{r eval=TRUE}
# Convert dataframe structure for passing to barplot()
cotton_transpose <- t(cotton)[2:4,] / YDIV
colnames(cotton_transpose) <- c("", paste0("'", 43:48))
cotton_transpose
```

Note that I've supplied column names here in the form they'll appear on the plot (e.g. `'43`), except for the first column, which I've left blank because the axis label needs to be applied separately for that one case.

Spear's cotton barplot uses hatching (i.e. parallel lines in one direction) and crosshatching (i.e. perpendicular lines laid over each other) to 'shade' the bars. This approach was used a lot in manual charting because colour wasn't necessarily available, and it was easy enough to achieve with a set square and rule.

R lets you control the `density` and `angle` of shading in a `barplot()`, but the angle can only take one value. To create a crosshatch, you need to lay down a separate `barplot()` layer that is composed only of hatching in one direction. You can then supply a second `barplot()` call with the hatching in the other direction.

```{r}
# Barplot layer with hatching only (allows for crosshatching)
barplot(
  cotton_transpose, 
  axes = FALSE,  # no axes
  xaxt = "n",  # no x-axis bar labels
  ylim = BP_YLIM,
  space = BP_SPACE,  # space between bars
  border = WHITE,  # border around bars
  col = BLACK,
  density = rep(c(BP_HATCH_HI, 0, BP_HATCH_LO), 7),  # line 'closeness'
  angle = 360 - BP_HATCH_ANGLE  # top-left to bottom-right
)
```

This is the bar plot with only the first layer of hatching:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-06-08-recreate-spear_files/2_bp_1.png" alt="The recreated plot in progress: the line plot is completed; the first layer of bar plot hatching has been added." width="100%"/>
</div>

Note that this layer of hatching is only required in the bottom and top bars of the stack because they will end up being crosshatched. The middle bar is only hatched, not crosshatched.

```{r}
# Barplot layer with features
barplot(
  cotton_transpose, 
  axes = FALSE,
  ylim = BP_YLIM,
  space = BP_SPACE,
  col = BLACK,
  density = rep(c(BP_HATCH_HI, BP_HATCH_MID, BP_HATCH_LO), 7),
  angle = BP_HATCH_ANGLE, # bottom-left to upper-right
  add = TRUE  # add as layer on top of existing plot
)
```

And now we have both layers of hatching, the bar boundaries and the x-axis bar labels:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-06-08-recreate-spear_files/2_bp_2.png" alt="The recreated plot in progress: the line plot is completed; the bar plot has bars with hatching and outlines, and axis labels." width="100%"/>
</div>

You'll notice I suppressed the axes again. The approach to building the bar plot axes is very similar to that of the line plot, using `axis()`, `box()` and `mtext()`.

```{r}
# Manual y-axis (just ticks)
axis(
  side = 2,
  at = BP_YTICK_SEQ,
  tck = YTICK_LEN,
  labels = FALSE,
  col = WHITE,
  col.ticks = BLACK
)

# Manual y-axis (just labels)
axis(
  side = 2,
  at = c(0.4, BP_YTICK_SEQ, 24.6), 
  tck = 0, 
  labels = BP_YLAB_SEQ, 
  las = 1, 
  col = WHITE
)

# Manual secondary y-axis (just ticks)
axis(
  side = 4,
  at = BP_YTICK_SEQ,
  labels = FALSE,
  tck = YTICK_LEN,
  col = WHITE,
  col.ticks = BLACK
)

# X-axis label: horizontal at top of axis
mtext("Millions of Boles", side = 3, adj = -0.09, cex = CEX - 0.1)

# The first label is at the origin
mtext("1942", side = 1, line = 0.2, adj = -0.06, cex = CEX)

# Bounding box around plot boundary
box()
```

Awkwardly, the first x-axis label in the bar plot (`1942`) had to be created manually because it's placed under the origin point in the original chart, rather than under the bar itself.

Finally we can add the labels over the top of the bars. I've done this in a similar iterative manner as the line plot, where there's a call to create a white box with `rect()`, over which a `text()` label can be applied.

```{r}
# Apply labels iteratively
mapply(
  function(x, y, xleft, ybottom, xright, ytop, label) { 
    rect(xleft, ybottom, xright, ytop, col = WHITE, border = NA)
    text(x, y, label, cex = CEX)
  },
  xleft   = c(4.4,  4.3,  3.2),
  ybottom = c(14.4, 10.4, 6.4),
  xright  = c(6.6,  6.7,  7.8),
  ytop    = c(15.6, 11.6, 7.6),
  x = 5.5,
  y = c(15, 11, 7),
  label = c("STOCKS*", "EXPORTS", "U. S. CONSUMPTION")
)

```

And here's our visualisation with both plots completed:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-06-08-recreate-spear_files/2_bp_3.png" alt="The recreated plot in progress: both the line plot on the left and the bar plot on the right are completed with axes, data, labels and arrows." width="100%"/>
</div>

# 4. Margin labels {#marginplot}

With both charts completed, we can add with `mtext()` the titles and captions that exist for the plot as a whole.

The main title uses a different font family than was specified in `par()`, so we override it with the `family` argument. 

I couldn't find a good (free) approximation of the font family that Spear used, so I've used one that has a similar 'feel', even if many of the typographical features are wrong (e.g. single-storey 'a'). Here I've settled with '[Hussar Bold Condensed](https://www.ffonts.net/Hussar-Bold-Condensed.font)'. Let me know if you recognise Spear's font.

```{r}
# Main title
mtext(
  text = "Distribution   of   United   States   Cotton",
  outer = TRUE,  # outer plot margin
  side = 3,  # top
  line = -3,  # relative to outside to plot limit
  cex = CEX + 0.5,
  family = "Hussar Bold Condensed",
  font = 2  # bold
)
```

The remaining labels were just a case of fiddling with the `line` and `at` arguments to get them in the right place.

```{r}
# 'Subtitle' for line plot
mtext(
  text = "MULTIPLE CURVE",
  outer = TRUE,
  side = 3,
  line = -1,
  adj = 0.06,  # nudge
  cex = CEX,
  font = 3  # italic
)

# 'Subtitle' for bar plot
mtext(
  text = "COMPONENT COLUMN",
  outer = TRUE,
  side = 3,
  line = -1,
  adj = 0.68,
  cex = CEX,
  font = 3
)

# Caption: source
mtext(
  text = "Source: U. S. Department of Agriculture",
  outer = TRUE,
  side = 1,  # bottom
  line = -1,
  adj = 0.02,
  cex = CEX
)

# Caption: stocks asterisk
mtext(
  text = "*END OF SEASON, JULY 31",
  outer = TRUE,
  side = 1,
  line = -2,
  adj = 0.94,
  cex = CEX - 0.2,
)

# Caption: US cotton
mtext(
  text = "U. S. Supply of U. S. Cotton",
  outer = TRUE,
  side = 1,
  line = -1,
  adj = 0.97,
  cex = CEX
)
```

And so the final output looks like this:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-06-08-recreate-spear_files/3_final.png" alt="The recreated plot in progress: the recreation is complete, with both the line adn bar plots completed and the titles and captions added." width="100%"/>
</div>

And a gif of the steps of the chart's creation, ending with the original image:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-06-08-recreate-spear_files/cottonviz.gif" alt="Gif where each frame shows the progression of recreating an original plot about cotton supplies in 1940s USA. Axes and lines are added to a plot on the left, then crosshatching, bars and axes are added to a plot on the right, and finally some titles and captions are added. The original plot is shown in the final frame to compare it to the recreation." width="100%"/>
</div>

# 5. Saving {#saving}

Having opened a graphics device earlier with `png()` and then added out plotting elements, we can close the graphics device and save the output.

```{r}
dev.off()
```

You'll want to run all the code from start to finish to encompass the `png()` call at the start and the `dev.off()` call at the end. I've [put all the code in a GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/matt-dray/379ea4303ba7ec6c6757a5d6e3722e95) to make it easier to copy-paste, should you want to recreate it.

# Reflections

The final output certainly isn't a perfect match for the original, but I think it gets 90% of the way there without the need for endless tweaking. There were some particularly tricky things I was able to deal with, but also some things that I need to improve to make the recreation identical to the original.

## Tricky parts

There were a few non-standard plot elements that needed to be dealt with, but are relatively trivial with base R functions. To review:

* the minimum and maximum labels on the y axis are not on the ticks, they're slightly above and below them, respectively
* hatching can only be done in one direction, so it requires an 'under-layer' of hatching in the opposite direction to that of the main plot itself
* there's no function in base to apply a text label with a filled box under it; you need to use `text()` and `rect()` together
* the x-axis labels aren't all the same: the first is `1942` and the rest are in the form `'43` .
* the first x-axis label on the bar chart, `1942` is not actually under the bar, but under the origin.

## Improvements

There's a lot of things I could do, but there would be a few things to prioritise:

* I've used a lot of manual adjustments to get the chart elements in roughly the right place; that's fine for a one-off chart like this, but isn't that useful for making this code more generic
* I didn't get the ruler out and measure everything, so there are slight differences when the original and recreation are overlaid
* I haven't really optimised the code or tried to tidy it up; there may be some unecessary liens that were part of development that don't need to be in the final script
* I've tried to match the font families as best I can, but the font used in the main title is particularly difficult to find a (free) match for
* R's built-in line dashes aren't quite the same as Spear's, but I think they're close enough

And finally a bonus improvement, though it requires you to download a package. We can save our plot with maximum resolution, etc, but for fun we can invoke some of the artefacts that are present in Spear's plot with some help from [the {magick} image-processing package](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/index.html) via Jeroen Ooms and rOpenSci (e.g. see below for how to add blur).

```{r}
library(magick)  # install from CRAN

# Read the plot PNG
cottonviz <- image_read("~/Desktop/cottonviz.png")  # set to your path

# Apply blurring parameters
cottonviz_blur <- image_blur(
  cottonviz,
  radius = 14, sigma = 7  # blur parameters
)

# Save the image
image_write(
  cottonviz_blur,
  "~/Desktop/cottonviz_blur.png"  # set to your path
)
```

That would end up looking like this:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-06-08-recreate-spear_files/5_blur.png" alt="The final recreation plot with blur applied to mimic the artefacts involved in the hand-drawing and photocopying of the original." width="100%"/>
</div>

With a bit more tweaking and addition of some noise, you could probably do a good job of mimicking the 'aged' look of the original.

[^recreate]: As an aside, I've also been inspired of late by [#RecreationThursday on Twitter](#recreationthursday). It's a community challenge to [recreate an art piece](https://twitter.com/_natalie_oshea/status/1400526683170541570?s=20) selected each fortnight by a rotating curator (as in the curator changes, not that they're physically spinning).
[^spear]: I admit to not knowing much about Spear, so I'm glad that she was selected as the subject of the challenge. One thing I learnt is that Spear might be best known for the box plot, which she originated as the 'range plot' in her book [Charting Statistics](https://archive.org/details/ChartingStatistics_201801).
[^mismatch]: You may have noticed that the 'US consumption' line appears a little different to that in Spear's original, where the line is flatter. I don't yet know if this is an issue with the supplied data.
[^base]: I haven't spent much time with base plotting in the last five years (!) and I'm getting increasingly agitated by mounting dependencies in my projects. Locals have been confused recently by a strange fellow walking the streets, repeating [the tinyverse](http://www.tinyverse.org/) mantra of 'lightweight is the right weight'.
