<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats">The Mountain Goats</a> released <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/music/in-league-with-dragons/the-mountain-goats"><em>In League with Dragons</em></a> today, their <a href="http://www.mountain-goats.com/discography/">seventeenth studio album</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Darnielle">John Darnielle</a> has written a lot of words across the Mountain Goat’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats_discography">back catalogue</a>. His lyrics are poetic and descriptive, covering fictional and autobiographical themes that include susbtance abuse, professional wrestling and cadaver-sniffing dogs.</p>
<p>Can we generate new Mountain Goats lyrics given this rich text dataset? This is a short post to do exactly that using the {spotifyr}, {genius} and {markovifyR} packages for R.</p>

<h1>Get lyrics</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/">The {spotifyr} package</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> pulls artist and album information from the music streaming service <a href="https://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a>, along with some interesting audio features like ‘danceability’ and ‘acousticness’. It also fetches lyrics from <a href="https://genius.com/">Genius</a> via <a href="https://github.com/josiahparry/genius">the {genius} package</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>First get a developer account for the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify API</a>. Run <code>usethis::edit_r_environ()</code> and add your client ID and secret in the form <code>SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=X</code> and <code>SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=Y</code>. The <code>get_spotify_access_token()</code> function will add an access token to your environment, which will authenticate each API request.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(spotifyr)  # install.packages(&quot;spotifyr&quot;)
access_token &lt;- get_spotify_access_token()</code></pre>
<p>The <code>get_discography()</code> function fetches a named artist’s back-catalogue, including the lyrics. Beware: this may include some duplicates from different regions or because of reissues or deluxe versions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>goat_discography &lt;- spotifyr::get_discography(&quot;the mountain goats&quot;)
dim(goat_discography)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 399  41</code></pre>
<p>This is a hefty dataframe with 41 columns of data for nearly 400 songs. Let’s simplify the columns and for fun we can look at five random sings and their ‘energy’.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)  # for data manipulation and %&gt;%

goat_disco &lt;- goat_discography %&gt;% 
  ungroup() %&gt;% 
  select(
    album_name, album_release_year,  # album
    track_name, track_number, duration_ms,  # track info
    key_name, mode_name, key_mode, tempo, time_signature,  # music info
    danceability, energy, loudness, mode, speechiness,  # audio features
    acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence,  # audio features
    lyrics
  )

sample_n(goat_disco, 5) %&gt;%
  select(album_name, track_name, energy)  # a sample</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 5 x 3
##   album_name                         track_name                      energy
##   &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;chr&gt;                            &lt;dbl&gt;

## 2 Protein Source Of The Future... N… Duke Ellington                   0.49 
## 3 Heretic Pride                      Marduk T-Shirt Men&#39;s Room Inci…  0.171

## 5 Tallahassee                        See America Right                0.821</code></pre>
<p>I’ll be saving this dataframe for some other analysis, but for now we’ll need only the lyrics. The lyrics are stored in a list-column as a separate tibble (data frame) per song.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyr)  # for unnest()

goat_lyrics &lt;- goat_disco %&gt;%
  filter(lyrics != &quot;NULL&quot;) %&gt;%  # remove rows where lyrics weren&#39;t collected
  unnest(lyrics) %&gt;%  # unpack the lyrics list-column
  filter(!is.na(lyric)) %&gt;%  # remove empty lyrics
  select(-line) %&gt;%  # unneeded column
  group_by(lyric) %&gt;% slice(1) %&gt;%  ungroup() %&gt;% # remove duplicate lyrics
  pull(lyric)  # convert column to character vector

sample(goat_lyrics, 10)  # a sample</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;Waiting for the other shoe to drop in Tampa Bay&quot;            
##  [2] &quot;When you said your name out loud&quot;                           
##  [3] &quot;And a thousand dead friends can&#39;t stop me&quot;

##  [6] &quot;And when the nurse comes in to change my sheets and clothes&quot;
##  [7] &quot;Can&#39;t you see the door&#39;s burning?&quot;                          
##  [8] &quot;The suffocated splendor&quot;                                    
##  [9] &quot;But I couldn&#39;t remember, I honestly could not remember&quot;     
## [10] &quot;Things will shortly get completely out of hand&quot;</code></pre>

<div id="generate-lyrics" class="section level1">
<h1>Generate lyrics</h1>
<p>We can use a Markov chain to generate new lyrics based on our dataset. Basically, it will predict the next word from the current one based on the likelihood from our input dataset. You can <a href="https://hackernoon.com/from-what-is-a-markov-model-to-here-is-how-markov-models-work-1ac5f4629b71">read more about this principle elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/abresler/markovifyR">The {markovifyR} package</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> is a wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify">the Python package <code>markovify</code></a>, which ‘is a simple, extensible Markov chain generator’. You can install <code>markovify</code> at the command line via R’s <code>system()</code> function. {furrr} is also needed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># system(&quot;pip install markovify&quot;)
library(markovifyR)  # install.packages(&quot;markovifyR&quot;)
library(furrr)  # install.packages(&quot;furrr&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can generate the model given all the lyrics.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>markov_model &lt;- generate_markovify_model(
    input_text = goat_lyrics,
    markov_state_size = 2L,
    max_overlap_total = 25,
    max_overlap_ratio = 0.7
  )</code></pre>
<p>You can meddle with these controls, but I’ve kept to the suggested defaults for now. Note that ‘overlap’ relates to the likelihood of generating whole sentences that already exist. See <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify"><code>markovify</code></a> for more detail.</p>
<p>Now to generate a bunch of lines.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>goat_speak &lt;- markovify_text(
  markov_model = markov_model,
  maximum_sentence_length = NULL,
  output_column_name = &#39;goat_speak&#39;,
  count = 50,
  tries = 100,
  only_distinct = TRUE,
  return_message = TRUE
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## goat_speak: You and I know that in one day
## goat_speak: I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here to get beneath my skin is warming up now
## goat_speak: Tried to think like a dark cloud full of wet rain
## goat_speak: Except for the punchline
## goat_speak: You&#39;ve stepped back from the same time
## goat_speak: While I mouth my silent curses at you, I used to know you, I love you anymore
## goat_speak: And no one screams cause it&#39;s just about
## goat_speak: Watched him tearing through the clean, clean windows
## goat_speak: Then we couldn&#39;t hear my stage directions
## goat_speak: Here we come to life
## goat_speak: Even when I should not
## goat_speak: And there&#39;s honeysuckle on the front row
## goat_speak: And if I saw the whole wide world
## goat_speak: Was coming right along
## goat_speak: Why don&#39;t you worry
## goat_speak: Hope it never rains here
## goat_speak: Snuck out to dry
## goat_speak: And it was real inviting
## goat_speak: Long life to see the snow
## goat_speak: You must be cold outside
## goat_speak: Safe behind the Chinese rifle sounded in the firmament
## goat_speak: Lead a long time ago
## goat_speak: Nowhere to run out sometime
## goat_speak: Looking up at a liquor store
## goat_speak: But I could feel your smile burning through
## goat_speak: Swing low sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet chariot
## goat_speak: And the fog has lifted
## goat_speak: Try not to think good thoughts
## goat_speak: I can see you come my way
## goat_speak: And in their numbers
## goat_speak: There&#39;s more like me where I am coming home
## goat_speak: You said that in California the waves break on the west coast
## goat_speak: You put on your face with that apricot scrub again
## goat_speak: Learn to love you twice
## goat_speak: We keep up the doors
## goat_speak: And it was warm on my own skin but I never come off now
## goat_speak: Show up in the drain
## goat_speak: I will find a little
## goat_speak: From the entrance to the Broadway Bridge
## goat_speak: And the sun&#39;s coming up quickly above the strange, white plain
## goat_speak: And I don&#39;t even come out
## goat_speak: Stick to the ballpark
## goat_speak: Give her some hungry reggae
## goat_speak: And I saw the last best thing I&#39;ve done something worse
## goat_speak: A year or so ago I worked down at all
## goat_speak: Ghosts of my stereo
## goat_speak: It all came back from the killing floor
## goat_speak: Maybe hold you I know what I must
## goat_speak: It&#39;s like I&#39;ve got very little money left
## goat_speak: Not sure what I&#39;m gonna bake you a drink in years</code></pre>
<p>Mountain Goats fans will probably recognise a few familiar patterns in the text that emerges.</p>
<p>I ran this function a few times and here a few outputs that made me laugh (or think):</p>
<ul>
<li>And a bird we would have liked brought the Norman invasion</li>
<li>I hope I never liked Morrissey</li>
<li>Went and got the case of vodka from a disco in old east Berlin</li>
<li>Fresh coffee at sunrise, warm my lips like a dying man</li>
<li>But I felt all the Portuguese water dogs?</li>
<li>But my love is like a tattoo into my ear</li>
<li>I write reminders on my kimono that I could not remember</li>
<li>And you brought me a bowl of cooked wild grasses</li>
<li>We had hot caramel sticking to her skin</li>
<li>And then the special chicken</li>
<li>Leann Rimes on the ocean</li>
<li>Sunset spilling through your megaphone</li>
<li>It’s the most gorgeous cow I’d ever wanted</li>
<li>How come there’s peacocks in the face of the rainbow</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also choose to seed the first word in the sentence. You can do this in such a way that you can create a sort-of possible-sounding stanza.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>goat_speak &lt;- markovify_text(
  markov_model = markov_model,
  maximum_sentence_length = NULL,
  output_column_name = &#39;goat_lyric&#39;,
  start_words = c(&quot;I&quot;, &quot;And&quot;, &quot;But&quot;, &quot;So&quot;),
  count = 1,
  tries = 100,
  only_distinct = TRUE,
  return_message = TRUE
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## goat_lyric: I know you see him, you&#39;ll know
## goat_lyric: And I start to gather outside
## goat_lyric: But one of us said a word I say it, but I don&#39;t know when
## goat_lyric: So tie down the line</code></pre>
<p>…or not.</p>
<p>I think John Darnielle probably remains the best generator of Mountain Goats lyrics for now.</p>
