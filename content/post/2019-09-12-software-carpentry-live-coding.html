<h1>Carving new coders</h1>
<p><a href="https://carpentries.org/about/">The Carpentries</a> is a global non-profit initiative to help build foundational skills in coding and data science. For example, <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> contains <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/">lessons about the shell, git, R and Python</a>.</p>
<p>I took part in a two-day remote workshop to learn how to become a badged Carpentries instructor. There was a strong focus on pedagogy: understanding how people learn and how to teach.</p>
<p>The schedule and materials from the workshop <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">are available openly online</a>. I encourage you to take a look and <a href="https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/">consider becoming an instructor yourself</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="whittling-down-the-complexity" class="section level1">
<h1>Whittling down the complexity</h1>
<p>The Carpentries use <a href="https://carpentries.org/workshops/">a specific workshop format</a> with a strong emphasis on using participatory live coding. This means people follow along with the instructor who is sharing their screen at the front of the room. There are no slideshows to sit through, so no <a href="https://dilbert.com/strip/2010-02-22">‘death by PowerPoint’</a>.</p>
<p>There are some features of live coding that make it conducive to learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>it slows down the pace so all learners can keep up</li>
<li>instructors must explain what they’re doing with every line, encouraging detailed explanation</li>
<li>learners become familiarised with running code given the particulars of their machine and software</li>
<li>it’s beneficial for learners to see the instructor making mistakes and correcting them</li>
</ul>
<p>I learnt a lot from this part of the workshop and wanted to record it.</p>
</div>
<div id="say-what-you-saw" class="section level1">
<h1>Say what you saw</h1>
<p>You can probably remember a workshop that you enjoyed and learnt a lot from. Maybe you can think of one that didn’t go so well. What was the difference? How can you, as an instructor, engage with participants and motivate learning?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/index.html">the ‘live coding is a skill’ lesson</a> of the workshop we watched two videos of an instructor<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> doing some live coding in front of a class: one with things to improve upon and one with more positive behaviours.</p>
<p>Consider how well these adhere to <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/index.html#top-ten-tips-for-participatory-live-coding-in-a-workshop">The Carpentries top ten tips for participatory live coding</a>.</p>
<div id="clamp-down-on-negative-behaviours" class="section level2">
<h2>Clamp down on negative behaviours</h2>
<p>First, the one that could be improved:</p>
<div align="center">
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bXxBeNkKmJE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe></p>
</div>
<p>What did you notice? What would make it difficult for you to engage? For example, the instructor didn’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>check if everyone could see the small white-on-black text on the screen</li>
<li>explain each line as it was executed</li>
<li>turn off notifications on their computer and phone</li>
<li>notice a participant’s sticky note (<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/#sticky-notes">used in The Carentries to signal that the learner needs help</a>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="make-it-plane" class="section level2">
<h2>Make it plane</h2>
<p>The second video demonstrated more positive behaviours.</p>
<div align="center">
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkPmwe_WjeY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe></p>
</div>
<p>For example, the instructor:</p>
<ul>
<li>explained each line as it was being typed</li>
<li>re-sized the shell so people will always see the last-typed line</li>
<li>physically pointed out things on the projector screen to reinforce what was happening in the code</li>
<li>made an error, but talked it through</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="hammer-it-home" class="section level1">
<h1>Hammer it home</h1>
<p>We then did short, three-minute, live-coding demos of Carpentries materials. We did this in small groups and everyone gave feedback based on what was learnt in <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/11-practice-teaching/index.html">another part of the workshop</a>.</p>
<p>We ran the demo twice each: <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/index.html">the first time</a> was relatively cold with little preparation, but for <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/17-performance/index.html">the second attempt</a> we had a chance to react to the feedback and to think about <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/demos_rubric/">the teaching demo assessment rubric</a>.</p>
<div id="sanding-the-rough-edges" class="section level2">
<h2>Sanding the rough edges</h2>
<p>I chose to do the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/05-data-structures-part2/index.html">‘exploring data frames’</a> episode of the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/">R for Reproducible Scientific Research lesson</a> of <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>.</p>
<p>Positive feedback from my first attempt included that I:</p>
<ul>
<li>made sure everyone could see what was on my screen and it was at a sufficient zoom level (I had reset RStudio to its defaults because this is what beginners would see)</li>
<li>gave the learning objectives and recap of the previous session to remind people what we were doing and what we had done already</li>
<li>executed code line by line at an appropriate speed with clear instructions</li>
</ul>
<p>Some points to improve upon where that I:</p>
<ul>
<li>didn’t say out loud the keyboard shortcut that I was using to execute the lines,</li>
<li>explained that <code>cbind()</code> meant ‘column bind’, but I said that the <code>c()</code> function was was for ‘concatenating’ elements into vectors and this word isn’t familiar to everyone</li>
<li>used the word ‘simply’ when describing how to do something, a phrase that could undermine a learner’s progress if they aren’t able to complete that task (a case of an ‘expert blind spot’, as <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/03-expertise/#expertise-and-teaching">discussed in the ‘expertise and instruction’ lesson</a> of the workshop)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="nailing-it" class="section level2">
<h2>Nailing it</h2>
<p>I reacted to the feedback to help improve things for my second live-coding demo. For example, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>said out-loud every action I was doing, including physical key presses when necessary (e.g. “and run this line with the command and enter shortcut”)</li>
<li>avoided phrases like ‘simply do this’ and ‘just do that’</li>
<li>said that the ‘c’ in the <code>c()</code> function means to ‘combine’ rather than to ‘concatenate’<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also did a couple of extra things:</p>
<ul>
<li>added three lines of comments at the top of the file to explain the objectives and goals</li>
<li>pre-loaded an object into the environment (they learnt how to do this in the previous session) to avoid a slightly awkward explanation at the beginning</li>
<li>expanded my RStudio window so more code be seen at once</li>
</ul>
<p>This was well-received and made a difference to interpretability.</p>

<h1>I axe one thing of you</h1>
<p>I got a lot out of the workshop and will be continuing <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/">the checkout process</a> to get badged as a Carpentries instructor.</p>
<p>Do take a look at <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">the workshop materials</a> and <a href="https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/">consider becoming an instructor yourself</a>.</p>
