# tl;dr 

I used [the {bs4cards} package](https://bs4cards.djnavarro.net/articles/introduction.html) by [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/) to create an effortless online 'gallery' of 'art' on a single [R Markdown page](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/): [faxcrayon.art](https://faxcrayon.art).

# Art is a lie

Turns out you can just put up some pictures on the internet and call it a gallery. No one is stopping you.

Here is a foolproof approach: R Markdown with {bs4cards} to write the content, GitHub Pages to serve it, and a totally rad URL to convince people you're legit.

## {bs4cards}

The [{bs4cards}](https://bs4cards.djnavarro.net/articles/introduction.html) package (available on CRAN) is great because it lets you create customisable 'cards' that you can tile on an R Markdown page.

To create a card, you use the `card()` function with arguments for `title`, `image`,[^alt] `text`, `link`, etc. You can put these in a list and pass that to `card_grid()` to make a grid. Of cards. A card grid.

So, this format could work well to bring disparate information together in one central location, like a blog's landing page, where a card's content gives you a preview of post that you can click to visit it.

So I did just that: [I made a single page](https://github.com/matt-dray/faxcrayon)[^site] where each card displays an art piece I created with R code for [#RecreationThursday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23recreationthursday), or whatever.

The cards contain the creation date in the header; the 'name' of the piece as the card title, which links out to where the code is hosted for recreating it; and in the card body it states whether the image is a recreation, a remix or something original.

<div class="figure">

Each one has a header with the date in, a square image in the middle, the name of the piece which is a link, and some body text that explains whether the piece is original, a remix or a recreation." width="100%"/>
</div>

You can find [the source on GitHub](https://github.com/matt-dray/faxcrayon).

## GitHub Pages

One of the easiest ways to serve an R Markdown file on the internet is to store it in a GitHub repository, knit it to HTML and then [enable GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

You go to the 'Pages' in your repository's settings to enable it and then your HTML is served so that it's available to anyone on the internet in the form <username.github.io/repository-name/file.html>.[^index]

## Domain

But <matt-dray.github.io/faxcrayon> isn't that exciting as URLs go, and since I'm going to be an internationally-famous and extremely financially-successful artist, it makes sense to improve [my online brand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPHK494AUxE) with a rad URL.

Where to get inspiration? I've tweeted images for #RecreationThursday using the fax[^fax] `r emo::ji("fax")` and crayon emojis `r emo::ji("crayon")` because I was using my rudimentary skills to create facsimile copies of original artworks. So... fax crayon? Like a wax crayon, but, like, fax? Plus it only cost two dollars, so.

There's [a small dance](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#about-custom-domain-configuration) you have to do to make GitHub Pages link to your domain, while your domain provider may themselves require [a particular set of settings](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages/).

It took half an hour or so for the domain dance to complete, but now the site is available at [faxcrayon.art](https://www.faxcrayon.art).

# Nothing is real

So: {bs4cards}, GitHub Pages and a totally hip URL.

Now I just need to work out how to integrate NFT[^nft] functionality to the site and quit my day job.

[^index]: If you're feeling fancy, you can call your file 'index.Rmd', which knits to 'index.html', which GitHub Pages serves with the slightly more succinct URL <username.github.io/repository-name>.
[^fax]: Younglings, the fax machine is an ancient and possibly imaginary piece of technology that's a mash-up of a telephone, photocopier and printer. All in one!
[^nft]: [Non-Fungible Tokens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz9zw7-_vhM) are Not For 'Thew.
[^alt]: You can pass `card_image("<path to image>", alt = "Descriptive alt text.")` to the `image` argument of `card()` to help improve accessibility.
[^site]: If you were less lazy than me you could turn this into [a fully-blown R Markdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-13.html), so that a card click takes you to a separate page for that piece.
