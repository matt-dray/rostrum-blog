# How to plot grouped continuous data?

A [boxplot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) lets you show continuous data split by categories, but it hides the data points and doesn't tell you much about distribution. A [violin chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot) will show the distribution but you still don't know about the density of data.

[Stripcharts](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/strip-chart/) show the data for each category as individual points. The points can be layered on top of each other where they take the same Y value and can be stretched arbitrarily along the X axis.

If you don't have too much data, or if you sample it, you can stop the data points in a stripchart from overlapping and instead line them up side by side where they take the same Y value. This is called a ['beeswarm'](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/~eklund/beeswarm/).

Why? Probably because the cloud of data you're plotting looks a bit like a swarm of bees.

# Obvious next step

We can test this theory by plotting the points as *actual bees*, *lol*. Well, *emoji* bees. Duncan (of [tidyxl](https://nacnudus.github.io/tidyxl/) and [unpivotr](https://nacnudus.github.io/unpivotr/) fame) did exactly this and tweeted the plot and code.

```{r duncan_tweet_code, echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "1063147214124580866")
```

To summarise, Duncan did this by hacking [emojis via `emoGG`](https://github.com/dill/emoGG) into [`ggbeeswarm`'s `geom_beeswarm()` function](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm) to create `gg_beeswarm_emoji()` (patent pending).

# Obvious next next step

Wouldn't it be better if the little emoji bees moved around a little bit? Almost like a [waggle dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance)?

I cheated a little bit and recoded the `geom_quasirandom()` function from `ggbeeswarm` instead of `geom_beeswarm()`. Why? Beeswarm plots have an inherent 'neatness' to them. *That is not becoming of a beeswarm*. Instead, `geom_quasirandom()` gives you some 'random' jitter each time you plot the data. 

So we can plot the same data several times and stack the images into a gif. One easy way to do this is via [the `magick` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html), a re-engineering of [the open-source ImageMagick sute of tools](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) from [Jeroen Ooms](https://twitter.com/opencpu) at [ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/).

# Code

Load the packages.

```{r packages, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(emoGG)  # remotes::install_github("dill/emoGG")
library(magick)
```

Recode the `geom_quasirandom()` to display emoji. [Idea stolen from Duncan's tweet](https://twitter.com/nacnudus/status/1063147214124580866).

```{r geom_quasirandom}
geom_quasi_emoji <- function (mapping = NULL, data = NULL, width = NULL, varwidth = FALSE, 
          bandwidth = 0.5, nbins = NULL, method = "quasirandom", groupOnX = NULL, 
          dodge.width = 0, stat = "identity", position = "quasirandom", 
          na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE, emoji = "1f4l1d", ...) {
  
  img <- emoji_get(emoji)[[1]]
  
  position <- position_quasirandom(width = width, varwidth = varwidth, 
                                   bandwidth = bandwidth, nbins = nbins, method = method, 
                                   groupOnX = groupOnX, dodge.width = dodge.width)
  
  ggplot2::layer(data = data, mapping = mapping, stat = stat, 
                 geom = emoGG:::GeomEmoji, position = position, show.legend = show.legend, 
                 inherit.aes = inherit.aes, params = list(na.rm = na.rm, img = img, ...))
}
```

It makes sense to use the data that Duncan generated so we can compare the static plot to the animated one.

```{r data}
swarm <- data.frame(
  "variable" = rep(c("runif", "rnorm"), each = 100),
  "value" = c(runif(100, min = -3, max = 3), rnorm(100))
)
```

Let's define what our plot should look like. `method = "pseudorandom"` is the bit that gives us the jittering.

```{r ggplot}
plot <- ggplot(swarm, aes(variable, value)) +
  geom_quasi_emoji(emoji = "1f41d", method = "pseudorandom") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "skyblue")) +
  ggtitle("WAGGLE DANCE")
```

Now we can create a few versions of thi plot with different jittering. The plots are magick objects made with `image_graph()` from `magick`.

```{r plot_panels, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
my_res = 10
my_width = 500
my_height = 500
time_point <- paste0("t", 1:4)

for (i in seq_along(time_point)) {

  plot_object <- image_graph(width = my_width, height = my_height, res = my_res)
  
  assign(time_point[i], plot_object)
  
  ggplot(swarm, aes(variable, value)) +
    geom_quasi_emoji(emoji = "1f41d", method = "pseudorandom") +
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "skyblue")) +
    ggtitle("WAGGLE DANCE")
  
  dev.off()
  
}
```

We can loop through a few plots, each representing a frame in the final gif. 

```{r plot_create, echo=FALSE}
my_res = 100
my_width = 500
my_height = 500
time_point <- paste0("t", 1:4)

for (i in seq_along(time_point)) {
  fig_name <- time_point[i]
  assign(
    fig_name,  # set name
    image_graph(width = my_width, height = my_height, res = my_res)
  )
  print(
    ggplot(swarm, aes(variable, value)) +
      geom_quasi_emoji(emoji = "1f41d", method = "pseudorandom") +
      theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "skyblue")) +
      ggtitle("WAGGLE DANCE")
  )
  dev.off()
}
```

And now `image_animate()` can be used to combine those magick objects into a gif.

```{r animate}
waggle_dance <- image_animate(c(t1, t2, t3, t4))
waggle_dance
```

And we can save this with `image_write()`.

```{r save, eval=FALSE}
image_write(waggle_dance, "waggle_dance.gif")
```

Well done, we got through this without any bee puns.
