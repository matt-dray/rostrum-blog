<h1>Relay FM</h1>
<p>Podcasting is becoming big business. Music-streaming giant <a href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/">Spotify</a> <a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2019/Spotify-Announces-Strategic-Acquisitions-to-Accelerate-Growth-in-Podcasting/default.aspx">acquired</a> the podcast network <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/">Gimlet</a> last week for <a href="https://www.recode.net/2019/2/1/18207198/spotify-gimlet-podcast-acquisition">a reported 200 million dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Podcast networks act as centrally-managed collectives. This allows creators access to pooled expertise, management and resources while maximising ad revenue. Other examples of popular networks are <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/">The Incomparable</a>, <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a> and <a href="https://www.radiotopia.fm/">Radiotopia</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay FM</a> is a network that focuses largely on tech content. It was started by <a href="https//www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley">Myke Hurley</a> and <a href="https//www.relay.fm/people/stephenhackett">Stephen Hackett</a> in 2014.</p>
<p>Many of Relay FM’s hosts have hosted more than one podcast on the network. This post is about exploring and visualising this ‘Relayverse’.</p>
</div>
<div id="packages" class="section level1">
<h1>Packages</h1>
<p>I’m using two suites of ‘tidy’ packages in this post: one set for data collection and manipulation, and one set for graph network building, analysis and visualisation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Data collection and manipulation
library(dplyr)  # data manipulation
library(rvest)  # for scraping webpages
library(stringr)  # string manipulation
library(tidyr)  # tidying dataframes
library(purrr)  # applying functions over data

# Graph networks
library(tidygraph)  # set up graph network
library(ggraph)  # visualise static graphs
library(visNetwork)  # javascript interactive network</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="harvest-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Harvest data</h1>
<p>We can use the <code>rvest</code> package to scrape podcast details from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_FM">the Wikipedia page for Relay FM</a>. <code>read_html()</code> gets the HTML for the selected page; <code>html_node()</code> identifies which element needs to be scraped; and <code>html_table()</code> interprets the HTML information as a dataframe.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get the HTML for the selected page
relay_wiki &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_FM&quot;)

# Get the table with current shows
current &lt;- relay_wiki %&gt;%
  html_node(xpath = &#39;//*[@id=&quot;mw-content-text&quot;]/div/table[2]&#39;) %&gt;%
  html_table() %&gt;%
  filter(
    !Podcast %in% c(&quot;Members Only&quot;, &#39;Paid &quot;Members Only&quot; Shows&#39;, &quot;B-Sides&quot;)
  ) %&gt;%
  mutate(Status = &quot;Current&quot;)  # label rows as current shows

# Get the table with retired shows
retired &lt;- relay_wiki %&gt;%
  html_node(xpath = &#39;//*[@id=&quot;mw-content-text&quot;]/div/table[3]&#39;) %&gt;%
  html_table() %&gt;%
  select(-`Number of episodes`) %&gt;%
  mutate(Status = &quot;Retired&quot;)  # label rows as retired shows

# Combine the tablesinto one dataframe
shows &lt;- bind_rows(current, retired)</code></pre>
<p>Host names are in the form ‘First LastFirst Last’. We can split them apart where a lowercase letter is followed by an uppercase letter<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. This leaves us with a list column that we can <code>unnest()</code> to get one row per podcast-host combination. Our datframe is now tidy and ready for Tidygraph.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>shows_clean &lt;- shows %&gt;%
  mutate(
    Hosts = str_remove_all(Hosts, &quot; \\(originally\\)&quot;),
    Hosts = str_split(Hosts, &quot;(?&lt;=[a-z])(?=[A-Z])&quot;)
  ) %&gt;% 
  unnest() %&gt;% 
  select(Podcast, Hosts, Status)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="tidygraph" class="section level1">
<h1>Tidygraph</h1>
<p>Tidygraph was written by Tomas Lin Pedersen.</p>
<p>We need every host combination<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> for each podcast, which can be achieved with the <code>combn()</code> function. This gives us a pair of points (‘nodes’ in graph-speak) that can be connected by a line (an ‘edge’) to indicate their relationship.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>relay_combos &lt;- shows_clean %&gt;% 
  group_by(Podcast) %&gt;%  # operate within each podcast
  filter(n() &gt; 1) %&gt;%  # where there&#39;s more than one
  split(.$Podcast) %&gt;%  # split on podcast
  map(., 2) %&gt;%
  map(~combn(.x, m = 2)) %&gt;%   # all pair combiantions
  map(~t(.x)) %&gt;%  # transpose the matrix
  map(as_tibble) %&gt;%  # convert to a tibble dataframe
  bind_rows(.id = &quot;Podcast&quot;) %&gt;%  # list-element name to column
  select(V1, V2, Podcast)

print(relay_combos)</code></pre>

<p>We can turn this dataframe of host-pair combinations into a tidygraph object with the <code>as_tbl_graph()</code> function. This class of object contains two dataframes (the nodes and the edges) and some metadata.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>relay_graph &lt;- as_tbl_graph(relay_combos, directed = FALSE)

print(relay_graph)</code></pre>

<h1>Visualisation</h1>
<div id="static-with-ggraph" class="section level2">
<h2>Static with <code>ggraph</code></h2>
<p>Like <code>tidygraph</code>, <code>ggraph</code> was written by Tomas Lin Pedersen.</p>
</div>
<div id="interactive-with-visnetwork" class="section level2">
<h2>Interactive with <code>visNetwork</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/">The <code>visNetwork</code> package</a> wraps some JavaScript to make interactive network graphs. The <code>visNetwork()</code> function takes separate dataframes of edges and nodes, written in specific formats.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># We need an ID value
#relay_combos_id &lt;- mutate(relay_combos, id = as.character(row_number()))

# Dataframe of unique nodes with an ID value
nodes &lt;- shows_clean %&gt;%  # take our podcast-host dataset
  distinct(Hosts) %&gt;%  # get column of unique hosts
  arrange(Hosts) %&gt;% 
  mutate(id = as.character(row_number()), label = Hosts) %&gt;% 
  select(-Hosts) #%&gt;%  # provides pop up value on viz
  #mutate(title = label)  # provides pop-up value on viz

#
edges &lt;- relay_combos %&gt;% 
  left_join(nodes, by = c(&quot;V1&quot; = &quot;label&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  left_join(nodes, by = c(&quot;V2&quot; = &quot;label&quot;)) %&gt;%
  rename(from = id.x, to = id.y, title = Podcast)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can just plug the data into the function.</p>

  visOptions(highlightNearest = TRUE, nodesIdSelection = TRUE) %&gt;%
