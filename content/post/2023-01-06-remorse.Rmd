# tl;dr

[{remorse}](https://github.com/matt-dray/remorse) is a tiny R package that converts text to [Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) to audio.

# Beat a dead morse

In [the last post](https://www.rostrum.blog/2023/01/04/rogue-sfx/) I mentioned [{sonify}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sonify) for making R do little audible beeps and boops.

It reminded me of one (of many) unwritten micro-projects I've got kicking around in my brain: obviously you could use {sonify} to communicate Morse Code. And why not translate from text to Morse (and back) while you're at it?[^translate]

To be honest this was a classic case of name-driven development (NDD): I thought {remorse} was a funny name for a package and worked backwards from there. 

Obviously it says 'Morse' in the name, but also 'remorse' is usually what I feel after putting together a small pointless package; pointless-package existentialism (PPE) is something I have [a track history](https://matt-dray.github.io/projects/) with.

But of course, the true remorse is that I didn't find the better package-name pun: {morseinspector}. But maybe that's too long of a name and maybe non-Brits wouldn't understand [the reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Morse_(TV_series)). Maybe I'm thinking too hard.[^inspector]

# Oh dit-dit-dahling

Consider this highly plausible scenario: it's 20XX, the apocalypse has come, and the remaining humans on planet Earth communicate by Morse Code. For some reason.[^telegraph]

Wow, wouldn't it be handy to have a text-to-Morse translator? 

Well friend, if you've managed to find an electronic thinking box in the apocalyptic barren  wastelands (assuming electricity is still available (and the machine has R installed (and the {remorse} package was downloaded before the world's internet cut out (and you know how to use R (and you don't own a simpler, more portable Morse Code translation pamphlet))))), then you will have this incredible power at your fingertips.

Or maybe you'd rather risk it? Pfft.

# Use the Morse...

That's an awful lot of build-up for a very simple package. Let's take a look at what little it does.

As usual, {remorse} lives on GitHub[^edgy], so it can be downloaded with a little help from the typographically-adjacent {remotes} package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.github("remotes")
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/remorse")  # v0.1.1 here
```

That'll install {sonify} as well, which is needed for the audio.

Right so: text to Morse Code.

```{r}
text_in <- "Ahoy pal!"
morse <- remorse::txt2morse(text_in)
morse
```

So each letter has been translated to the relevant string of 'dits and dahs' ('dots' and 'dashes') that make up Morse Code. I've used a period (`.`) and hyphen (`-`) to represent these in {remorse}, with forward slashes (`/`) between Morse groups that represent individual characters, and a space for the spaces between words.

Note that not all characters can be converted to Morse Code. I did some research (Wikipedia) to discover the mappings from letters, numbers and punctuation to Morse Code. This information is used internally as a lookup, but is also exported in `morse_lookup`:

```{r}
remorse::morse_lookup
```

Of course, this means we can map backwards from Morse Code to letters, numbers and punctuation:

```{r}
text_out <- remorse::morse2txt(morse)
text_out
```

Morse Code has no sense of case, so it just converts it all to uppercase. Like you're shouting; the most clear form of communication.

So, you can argue justifiably that `txt2morse("yo") |> morse2txt()` is just a worse version of `toupper()` that strips out certain unmappable characters.

But of course it does so much more. Well, one thing more. Let's go from Morse to audio.

First a reminder of the code from earlier:

```{r}
morse
```

And to generate audio you just:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remorse::morse2sfx(morse)
```

The output sounds like this:

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/remorse/remorse.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

Wow. It plays audible dits (one 'time unit', default is `dit_length = 0.05` in seconds), dahs (three), spaces between dits and dahs (one), spaces between Morse character groupings (three) and spaces between words (seven). Tell all your friends.

So, do I still feel remorse for writing {remorse}, even after demonstrating its incredible power? Yes. All I ask is that you think of me in those apocalyptic wastelands.

<div class="tip"> `r fontawesome::fa("exclamation-circle")` <b>Update</b>

I just realised you can turn Morse Code into... Morse Code. Mind blown.

```{r}
remorse::txt2morse("hi") |>
  remorse::txt2morse()
```

'Morsest Code'. Why? Absolutely.

Maybe I've been watching [too much Tom7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLRdruqQfRk) recently.

[^inspector]: Not to mention that it's a bad pun: the package doesn't 'inspect' Morse; it translates it. Yep, definitely I'm thinking too hard about this.
[^telegraph]: Personally I'd rather see [telegraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy) make a comeback.
[^edgy]: Wow, how edgy, maybe he's had a bad run in with the CRAN maintainers, or perhaps he's read the bit of [the CRAN repository policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) that says 'a packageâ€™s contribution has to be non-trivial' ([whatever that means](https://fosstodon.org/@mattdray/109644645694966586)). Or he's just lazy.
[^translate]: Which completes my hattrick of 'R translation' packages, I suppose. [The {r2eng} package](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/11/14/hello-r2eng/) attempts to [translate R code to spoken English and have your computer speak it out loud](https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/11/14/hello-r2eng/). [The {dialga} package](https://www.github.com/matt-dray/dialga/) takes R code and [translates it to cron strings and those cron strings to English](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/04/10/dialga/).
