<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>I created the work-in-progress {r2eng} package (<a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/r2eng">source</a>, <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/r2eng/">site</a>) to help translate R expressions to speakable English. Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckW9sSdIVAc">Amelia McNamara</a> and with a huge amount of help from <a href="https://twitter.com/chainsawriot">Chung-hong Chan</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="communication-is-hard" class="section level1">
<h1>Communication is hard</h1>
<p>Amelia McNamara (<a href="http://www.amelia.mn/">site</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN">Twitter</a>) gave a talk at the useR! 2020 conference called ‘Speaking R’. Watch the video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckW9sSdIVAc">YouTube</a>, or take a look at the <a href="https://www.amelia.mn/SpeakingR/#1">slides</a>).</p>
<p>To summarise greatly: R code should be speakable so that we can teach, learn and communicate with minimal friction.</p>
<p>‘Speakable’ means I should be able to read an R expression to you as an English sentence, rather than reading out individual characters.</p>
<p>But this is all easier said than… said.</p>
<p>Ideally we’d have an agreed dictionary that maps each R token to an equivalent English phrase. But there will always be variation between users and across communities; between beginners and aficionados; and given differences in spoken language.</p>
<p>Then there’s context. We might agree that the operator <code>%&gt;%</code> is called a ‘pipe’, but you might say the word ‘then’ when reading an expression. So <code>data %&gt;% print()</code> might be spoken as ‘data <em>then</em> print’.</p>
<p>The order of parsing may also differ between people. Something as simple as <code>x &lt;- 1</code> could be ‘x gets 1’, ‘assign the value 1 to the variable named x’, or something else entirely. Now imagine that on the scale of an entire script.</p>
<p>I don’t think we can completely ‘solve’ any of this, but we could probably develop the conversation with the help of a tool accessible from R itself.</p>
</div>
<div id="introducing-r2eng" class="section level1">
<h1>Introducing {r2eng}</h1>
<p>This is where the {r2eng} package comes in. The goal is to take an R expression and translate it to an equivalent speakable, English sentence, from within R itself.</p>
<p>The initial focus has been to:</p>
<ul>
<li>concentrate on English translations</li>
<li>map the most common R operators</li>
<li>use commonly-used English translations for R operators</li>
<li>work on a simple one-to-one, left-to-right mapping of R to English</li>
<li>keep the API simple</li>
<li>begin a practical approach for addressing issues raised in Amelia’s presentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously the package is not finished, let alone perfect, and it requires more theoretical and practical considerations to make it truly useful. Clearly I don’t have all the answers and I’m certainly not an arbiter of language, but I think the purpose is defined and it certainly works for simple cases.</p>
<p>At worst, I hope the package will encourage discussion. There’s been some interest <a href="https://twitter.com/mattdray/status/1282378130901131264?s=20">on Twitter</a> and <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/how-do-you-speak-r/73727">on the RStudio Community site</a>, but do consider contributing thoughts and ideas to <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/r2eng">the {r2eng} GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>In this vein, it’s important to highlight Chung-hong Chan’s valuable contributions to the package. Check out his <a href="http://chainsawriot.com/">website</a> and find him on <a href="https://twitter.com/chainsawriot">Twitter</a>. Chung-hong was responsible for updating {r2eng} to handle <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/r2eng/commit/c38e0a44a785f3ac10dfd7a9302cf3f77091ba55">non-standard evaluation</a> in the <code>translate()</code> function and for replacing my original simple R-to-English lookup with a proper <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/r2eng/commit/dcbfa08a7b7798a76c6c7101c9c152b1a3ccb77f">parsing method</a> for interpreting R expressions.</p>
<div id="installation" class="section level2">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>You can install the package from GitHub, which is in development version 0.0.0.9005 at the time of writing. This post discusses current functionality. Things may change.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Having installed {remotes}
remotes::install_github(&quot;matt-dray/r2eng&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="how-it-works" class="section level2">
<h2>How it works</h2>
<div id="recognising-tokens" class="section level3">
<h3>Recognising tokens</h3>
<p>The secret sauce of the package is that it recognises the ‘tokens’ that make up an R expression. So the assignment operator, <code>&lt;-</code>, is recognised as a single token rather than the less-than (<code>&lt;</code>) and hyphen (<code>-</code>) characters typed sequentially.</p>
<p>This power is brought to {r2eng} thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jimhester/lintr">{lintr}</a>, a package by <a href="https://www.jimhester.com/">Jim Hester</a> that assesses your code for possible errors and style improvements.</p>
<p>An important part of this process is parsing R expressions and recognising tokens using the <code>lintr::get_source_expressions()</code> function. For example, it detects <code>&lt;-</code> as the special token <code>LEFT_ASSIGN</code>.</p>
<p>This is some deep R magic. You can see a <a href="https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/main/gram.y">special grammar file</a> file in the R source code that <a href="https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/main/gram.y#L2092-L2127">carries these mappings</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Put simply, {r2eng} hijacks this process and then adds the step of mapping each tokens to English terms, before recombining the text into a sentence.</p>
</div>
<div id="speech" class="section level3">
<h3>Speech</h3>
<p>By default, {r2eng} will translate an R expression and then your computer will speak it out loud.</p>
<p>This is relatively straightforward on a Mac: the resulting English text is handed to your machine with a <code>system()</code> call and is vocalised by the built-in VoiceOver text-to-speech converter. This functionality is not built into Windows by default, so the <code>system()</code> call fails silently.</p>
<p>Of course, this assumes that VoiceOver will do a good job of parsing the English expression from {r2eng}, but that isn’t guaranteed because of issues like localised pronunciation and uncommon words. I’ve written before about how <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/09/20/say-package/">text-to-speech isn’t necessarily that good at recognising R package names</a>, for example.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="using-r2eng" class="section level2">
<h2>Using {r2eng}</h2>
<p>You can find further examples in the package README, but I’ll explain here the main functionality here.</p>
<p>First I’ll attach the package havign installed it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(r2eng)</code></pre>
<div id="translate" class="section level3">
<h3>translate()</h3>
<p>There are two main functions in {r2eng}: <code>translate()</code> and <code>translate_string()</code>. They convert from a bare or quoted R expression, respectively, to English.</p>
<p><code>translate()</code> takes advantage of non-standard evaluation: you pass bare (i.e. unquoted) R code to the <code>expression</code> argument and a few things happen.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>translate(data &lt;- 1 + 1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Original expression: data &lt;- 1 + 1
## English expression: data gets 1 plus 1</code></pre>
<p>First, it prints both the original R expression and the corresponding English translation. Second, and only if you are using macOS, the English string is passed to a system command that vocalises the string.</p>
<p>Here’s a more complex example.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>translate(
  data %&gt;% select(x, y) %&gt;% filter(y == &quot;example&quot;),
  function_call_end = &quot;&quot;
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Original expression: data %&gt;% select(x, y) %&gt;% filter(y == &quot;example&quot;)
## English expression: data then select open paren x , y close paren then filter open paren y double equals string &quot;example&quot; close paren</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>function_call_end</code> argument in this example. The default is <code>"of "</code>, which would would have made the translation <code>data then select of open paren x y close paren</code>, etc. Feedback suggested that this was how some users spoke the English translation out loud, so the functionality has been included for now.</p>
<p>While <code>translate()</code> takes a bare expression, <code>translate_string()</code> takes a string.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(magrittr)  # attached for pipes
&quot;data&lt;-1+1&quot; %&gt;%
  translate_string(speak = FALSE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Original expression: data &lt;- 1 + 1
## English expression: data gets 1 plus 1</code></pre>
<p>We get the same sort of output as the <code>translate()</code> example, but this time I set the <code>speak</code> argument to <code>FALSE</code> to stop the English text from being ‘spoken’ by my computer and I also eliminated spaces from the input to demonstrate that they’re ignored.</p>
</div>
<div id="r2eng-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>r2eng objects</h3>
<p>Of course, you can assign a translation to an object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_translation &lt;- 
  translate(data &lt;- 1 + 1, speak = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>The object is a special <code>r2eng</code> S3 class of object, which is also a list.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>class(my_translation)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;list&quot;  &quot;r2eng&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can apply some methods to such an object: <code>print()</code>, <code>speak()</code> and <code>evaluate()</code>.</p>
<p>Print the object to see that custom console output again:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>print(my_translation)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Original expression: data &lt;- 1 + 1
## English expression: data gets 1 plus 1</code></pre>
<p>Re-call the system command that ‘speaks’ the R expression out loud (again, only on macOS).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>speak(my_translation)</code></pre>
<p>And you can actually evaluate the R expression you supplied to <code>translate()</code> in the first place. So the expression we supplied, <code>data &lt;- 1 + 1</code>, is evaluated so that calling <code>data</code> gives us the result of <code>1 + 1</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>evaluate(my_translation)
data</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="r2eng-class-list-elements" class="section level3">
<h3>r2eng-class list elements</h3>
<p>You can also access the R expression, the English translation and the mapping between them as elements of your <code>r2eng</code> list object.</p>
<p>Here’s the R expression again:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_translation$r_expression</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;data &lt;- 1 + 1&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And the translated output:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_translation$eng_expression</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot; data gets 1 plus 1 &quot;</code></pre>
<p>And a <code>data.frame</code> object that contains the mapping.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map &lt;- my_translation$translation_map
map[map$text != &quot;&quot;, ]  # filter out text spaces</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         token text  eng
## 1      SYMBOL data data
## 2 LEFT_ASSIGN   &lt;- gets
## 4   NUM_CONST    1    1
## 6         &#39;+&#39;    + plus
## 7   NUM_CONST    1    1</code></pre>
<p>This element is a good summary of what {r2eng} is doing under the hood: it breaks the R expression into recognised tokens and maps words to them where it knows what the corresponding English for that token should be. So <code>&lt;-</code> is recognised as the token <code>LEFT_ASSIGN</code>, which is mapped internally to the English text <code>gets</code>.</p>

<div id="rstudio-addin" class="section level3">
<h3>RStudio Addin</h3>
<p>The <code>print()</code> and <code>speak()</code> functions can be accessed via an RStudio addin that’s installed with the package (you may need to restart RStudio after installation). To use them, highlight an R expression in your script and select from the RStudio addins menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Speak R Expression In English’ to vocalise the expression through your computer’s speakers (macOS only)</li>
<li>‘Print R Expression In English’ to output an English translation to the console</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be mapped to keyboard shortcuts so you can highlight and translate quickly without specifically calling <code>translate()</code> and <code>print()</code> or <code>speak()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="binder-demo" class="section level3">
<h3>Binder demo</h3>
<p>Maybe you don’t want to install the package. That’s fine. Instead, you can try out the package by opening this <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a> instance of RStudio with {r2eng} and the tidyverse pre-installed. Click this badge to launch it:</p>
<p><a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/matt-dray/try-r2eng/master?urlpath=rstudio"><img src="http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg" alt="Launch Rstudio Binder" /></a></p>
<p>The downside is that you can’t use the speak method. Make sure to set the argument <code>speak = FALSE</code> in <code>translate()</code> or <code>translate_string()</code>, or you’ll get a warning message when you run your code.</p>
<p>You can find the source for this at <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/try-r2eng">try-r2eng</a> GitHub repo and you can <a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/08/25/holepunch-drake/">read one of my posts</a> on how to set up Binder using <a href="https://karthik.github.io/holepunch/">Karthik Ram’s {holepunch} package</a>.</p>

<div id="improvement" class="section level1">
<h1>Improvement</h1>
<p>As mentioned, this is really just the beginning.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of room for simple improvements, as well as some long term possibilities. For example, we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>expand the list of R tokens that can be translated</li>
<li>do user-research to find out the most common English terms used</li>
<li>provide instructions to make the speak method possible on non-Mac platforms</li>
<li>include full script awareness so that we aren’t limited by left-to-right interpretation</li>
<li>expand the package non-English languages ({r2es}, {r2fr}, etc)</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully we can work on some of these things and this won’t be the last post about {r2eng} on this blog. In the meantime, do consider contributing to <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/r2eng">the GitHub repo</a>.</p>
