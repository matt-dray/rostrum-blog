# tl;dr

I installed R on a Raspberry Pi 2 model B and set it up to use {blogdown}.

# Raspberry Pi

## Hardware

## Software

# Installing stuff

## R

R version 3.5.

```
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-core r-base-dev
```

## Pandoc

https://dev.to/psnebc/sudo-apt-get-install-pandoc-34m

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pandoc
```

## {blogdown}

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("blogdown")
```

I had to install {httpuv} separately.

## Hugo

`blogdown::install_hugo()` failed because it tried to install the 64-bit version.

I used [snapd](https://snapcraft.io/install/hugo/raspbian).

> Snaps are applications packaged with all their dependencies to run on all popular Linux distributions from a single build

To install snapd:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
```

After a reboot, install the Hugo snap:

```
sudo snap install hugo
```
