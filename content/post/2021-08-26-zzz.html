<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>I got curious about R package startup messages, so I grabbed all the special zzz.R files from R packages that are on CRAN and sourced on GitHub. You can jump to the <a href="#table-of-results">table of results</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="start-me-up" class="section level1">
<h1>Start me up</h1>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cortinah/status/1427429455409070090?s=20">I learnt recently from Hernando Cortina</a> that his and Amanda Dobbynâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/aedobbyn/multicolor/">{multicolor}</a> package prints to the console some multicoloured ASCII-art text of the packageâ€™s name when you call it with <code>library(multicolor)</code>.</p>
<p>It gave me an itch to scratch: how often are these sorts of startup messages used by R packages? What do people put in them? Is there anything funny in them? Anything nefarious?</p>
</div>
<div id="a-strong-attachment" class="section level1">
<h1>A strong attachment</h1>
<p>A package may need to run additional code before its functions can work, like maybe some <code>options()</code> need to be set.</p>
<p>There are two times this kind of code can be run: when the package is loaded, including namespace calls like <code>dplyr::select()</code>, or more specifically when the package is attached with <code>library()</code>.</p>
<p>To prepare code for running on-load or on-attach, you create the special functions <code>.onLoad()</code> and <code>.onAttach()</code>. These go in a zzz.R file in the R/ directory of your package, becauseâ€¦ convention?</p>
<p>The on-attach option is useful for printing messages for the user to see in the console, like the {multicolor} example above. You want this to happen on-attach and not on-load, since you wouldnâ€™t want to print a message every single your script uses the <code>::</code> namespace qualifier.</p>
<p>To specify a message in the body of your <code>.onAttach()</code> function, you use <code>packageStartupMessage()</code>. Why not just <code>cat()</code> or <code>message()</code>? Because it allows the user to quell startup messages using <code>suppressPackageStartupMessages()</code>.</p>
<p>You can learn more in Hadley Wickhamâ€™s <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/r.html#when-you-do-need-side-effects">R Packages</a> book.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the {tidyverse} package, which has some verbose output on attach:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## â”€â”€ Attaching packages â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ tidyverse 1.3.1 â”€â”€</code></pre>
<pre><code>## âœ“ ggplot2 3.3.5     âœ“ purrr   0.3.4
## âœ“ tibble  3.1.3     âœ“ dplyr   1.0.7
## âœ“ tidyr   1.1.3     âœ“ stringr 1.4.0
## âœ“ readr   2.0.1     âœ“ forcats 0.5.1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## â”€â”€ Conflicts â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ tidyverse_conflicts() â”€â”€
## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()</code></pre>
<p>But you can shush it with the <code>suppressPackageStartupMessages()</code> function:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>detach(&quot;package:tidyverse&quot;)  # first detach it
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))</code></pre>
<p>Peace.</p>
<p>So the startup messages of {multicolor} and {tidyverse} do two completely different things: one is fun and frivolous and the other is informative. Isnâ€™t it possible that someone could put ads in the startup message or use it in evil ways? Well, perhaps.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s find out what R package developers put in their startup messages. How many packages even have a <code>zzz.R</code> file and how many of those even contain a <code>packageStartupMessage()</code> call?</p>
</div>
<div id="catching-some-zs" class="section level1">
<h1>Catching some Zs</h1>
<p>I understand if all this talk of zzz.R causes you to ðŸ’¤. In short, if you want to get all the zzz.R files, you can:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Get a list of R packages on CRAN</li>
<li>Identify which ones have an associated GitHub repo</li>
<li>Get the default branch name of each one and construct the possible URL to their zzz.R file</li>
<li>Contact the possible zzz.R file to see if it exists</li>
<li>If it exists, download it</li>
<li>Filter for zzz.R files that contain <code>packageStartupMessage()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Weâ€™ve already attached the tidyverse packages, but weâ€™ll also need two more packages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(gh)    # interact with GitHub API
library(httr)  # requests via the internet </code></pre>
<div id="packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>Luckily you can grab info for all current CRAN packages with the very handy <code>CRAN_package_db()</code> function.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>cran_pkgs &lt;- as_tibble(tools::CRAN_package_db())</code></pre>
<p>This returns a dataframe containing 18112 rows, where each one is a package, along with 66 variables. We get information like the stuff thatâ€™s found in package DESCRIPTION files, but it doesnâ€™t tell us whether a package has a zzz.R file.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to visit the GitHub repo associated with the package, if it has one, and see if a zzz.R exists. Of course, many packages are not on GitHub, but weâ€™re going to ignore those for simplicity.</p>
</div>
<div id="github-repos" class="section level2">
<h2>Github repos</h2>
<p>A quick way of discovering if a package has a GitHub repo is to check for â€˜github.comâ€™ in the <code>BugReports</code> section of it DESCRIPTION file.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Again, this doesnâ€™t capture all the possible repos, but is fine for now.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>has_repo &lt;- cran_pkgs %&gt;% 
  select(Package, BugReports) %&gt;% 
  filter(str_detect(BugReports, &quot;github&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  transmute(
    Package,
    owner_repo = str_extract(
      str_replace_all(paste0(BugReports, &quot;/x&quot;), &quot;//&quot;, &quot;/&quot;),
      &quot;(?&lt;=github.com/).*(?=/[a-zA-Z])&quot;
    )
  ) %&gt;% 
  separate(owner_repo, c(&quot;owner&quot;, &quot;repo&quot;), &quot;/&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(Package), !is.na(owner), !is.na(repo)) %&gt;% 
  distinct(Package, owner, repo) %&gt;% 
  arrange(Package) 

sample_n(has_repo, 5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 5 Ã— 3

<p>If youâ€™re wondering why we didnâ€™t just use the package name as the repo name, itâ€™s because they sometimes donâ€™t match, e.g.Â {baseballDBR} is in a repo called â€˜moneyballâ€™.</p>
<p>Now we can use the repo details to build a URL to a potential zzz.R URL. This comes in the form <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/&lt;defaultbranch&gt;/R/zzz.R"</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="default-branch" class="section level2">
<h2>Default branch</h2>
<p>Youâ€™ll notice we donâ€™t yet know the default branch of the packageâ€™s GitHub repo. Historically, we could probably have just hard-coded â€˜masterâ€™, but the automatic default is now â€˜mainâ€™. And of course, the default branch could be something else entirely.</p>
<p>We can grab the default branch for each repo from the GitHub API using <a href="https://gh.r-lib.org/">the excellent {gh} package</a> by Gabor Csardi, Jenny Bryan and Hadley Wickham. Youâ€™ll <a href="https://gh.r-lib.org/articles/managing-personal-access-tokens.html">need to do some setup</a> to use it yourself.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve created â€˜possiblyâ€™ function variants with {purrr} so that any errors in the process are handled by returning <code>NA</code>, rather than breaking the loop, which would kill the process.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create &#39;try&#39; function versions
map2_possibly &lt;- possibly(map2, NA_real_)
gh_possibly &lt;- possibly(gh, NA_real_)

# Function: fetch repo details, print message on action
get_repo &lt;- function(owner, repo) {
  cat(paste0(&quot;[&quot;, Sys.time(), &quot;]&quot;), paste0(owner, &quot;/&quot;, repo), &quot;\n&quot;)
  gh_possibly(&quot;GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}&quot;, owner = owner, repo = repo) 
}

maybe_zzz &lt;- has_repo %&gt;%
  mutate(
    repo_deets =  map2_possibly(
      has_repo$owner, has_repo$repo, get_repo
    )
  ) %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    default_branch = map(
      repo_deets, ~pluck(.x, &quot;default_branch&quot;)
    ),
    default_branch = pluck(default_branch, 1),
    zzz_url = paste0(
      &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/&quot;,
      owner, &quot;/&quot;, repo, &quot;/&quot;, default_branch, &quot;/R/zzz.R&quot;
    )
  )</code></pre>
<p>So now we have a column with the returned repo information, the extracted default branch name and a URL that points to a potential zzz.R file in that repo.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>maybe_zzz</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6,569 Ã— 6

</div>
<div id="status-codes" class="section level2">
<h2>Status codes</h2>
<p>Now we can check the status code for each of the URLs weâ€™ve built. A return of <code>200</code> tells us that the file exists and <code>404</code> means it doesnâ€™t.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Again, we can prevent the loop breaking on error by creating a â€˜possiblyâ€™ version of <code>map()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(httr)  # for status_code()

map_possibly &lt;- possibly(map, NA_character_)

maybe_zzz_status &lt;- maybe_zzz %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    status = map_possibly(
      zzz_url, ~status_code(GET(.x))
    )
  ) %&gt;% 
  unnest(status)

count(maybe_zzz_status, status)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 Ã— 2
##   status     n
##    &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1    200  1237
## 2    404  5332</code></pre>
<p>Okay, great, weâ€™ve got over a thousand zzz.R files.</p>
</div>
<div id="read-content" class="section level2">
<h2>Read content</h2>
<p>Now we know which packages have a zzz.R file, we can use <code>readLines()</code> to grab their content from their URL, which again we can protect from errors with <code>purrr::possibly()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Function: readLines() but with a pause and message
readLines_delay &lt;- function(path) {
  sample(1:3, 1)
  cat(paste0(&quot;[&quot;, Sys.time(), &quot;]&quot;), path, &quot;\n&quot;)
  readLines(path, warn = FALSE)
}

readLines_delay_possibly &lt;- possibly(readLines_delay, NA_character_)

fosho_zzz &lt;- maybe_zzz_status %&gt;% 
  select(-repo_deets) %&gt;% 
  filter(status == 200) %&gt;%  # just the 
  mutate(lines = map_possibly(zzz_url, readLines_delay_possibly))

dim(fosho_zzz)</code></pre>
<p>So now we have a dataframe with a row per package and a list-column containing the R code in the zzz.R file.</p>
</div>
<div id="startup-messages" class="section level2">
<h2>Startup messages</h2>
<p>Finally, we can find out which packages have a <code>packageStartupMessage()</code> call inside their zzz.R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>has_psm &lt;- fosho_zzz %&gt;% 
  select(Package, lines) %&gt;%
  unnest(lines) %&gt;%
  filter(str_detect(lines, &quot;packageStartupMessage&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(lines = str_remove_all(lines, &quot; &quot;)) %&gt;%
  distinct(Package) %&gt;% 
  pull()

fosho_psm &lt;- filter(fosho_zzz, Package %in% has_psm)</code></pre>
<p>So we started with 18112 CRAN packages and have winnowed it to down to 467 (3%) that have a call to <code>packageStartupMessage()</code> in their zzz.R.</p>
</div>
<div id="table-of-results" class="section level2">
<h2><a href="#table-of-results">Table of results</a></h2>
<p>I could provide a table with all the zzz.R scripts that I collected, but I donâ€™t want to break any licenses by reproducing them all here. Instead, hereâ€™s an interactive table that links to the GitHub page for each zzz.R file.</p>

<h2>Patterns</h2>
<p>I had a scan through the scripts and found some frequent uses of <code>packageStartupMessages()</code> to:</p>
<ul>
<li>show a basic salutation (e.g.Â {afex})</li>
<li>show the version number, a check to see if the user has the latest version, sometimes a prompt to download the latest version for them (e.g.Â {vistributions}), sometimes a note that the package has been superseded by another (e.g.Â {drake})</li>
<li>links to guidance, examples, documentation (e.g.Â {bayesplot})</li>
<li>provide a citation or author names (e.g.Â {unvotes})</li>
<li>link to issue tracking or bug reporting (e.g.Â {timeperiodsR})</li>
<li>check for required supplementary software (e.g.Â {DALY})</li>
<li>remind of the need for credentials or keys for packages that access APIS, for example (e.g.Â {trainR})</li>
<li>provide terms of use, warranties, licenses, etc (e.g.Â {emmeans})</li>
</ul>
<p>I was also interested to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>a random tip, so you get something new each time you attach the package (e.g.Â {shinyjs})</li>
<li>appeals for GitHub stars (e.g.Â {sigminer})</li>
<li>links to purchasable course materials (e.g.Â {anomalise})</li>
</ul>
<p>And perhaps the most self-aware were several packages that reminded the user that they can turn off startup messages with <code>suppressPackageStartupMessages()</code> if the messages get too annoying (e.g.Â {dendextend}).</p>
<p>A few interesting specifics (possible spoiler alerts!):</p>
<ul>
<li>{bayestestR} and {sjmisc} have displays a special Star Wars message on a certain day of the yearâ€¦</li>
<li>{SHT} and {symengine} load ASCII art, as does {BetaBit}, which also prompts the user for a game theyâ€™d like to play</li>
<li>{depigner} says â€˜Welcome to depigner: we are here to un-stress you!â€™</li>
<li>{mde} has a friendly â€˜Happy Exploration :)â€™ salutation and {manymodelr} says â€˜Happy Modelling! :)â€™</li>
<li>{sjPLot} says â€˜#refugeeswelcomeâ€™</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the interactive table above to reach each of the zzz.R files for these packages, or have a sift through yourself to see what you can find.</p>

<div id="buy-my-stuff" class="section level1">
<h1>Buy my stuff</h1>
<p>Is there a line somewhere? Is it okay to advertise something? You could argue that someone has gone out of their way to release a package for free, so what harm is it in trying to get something back? or does this approach undermine the whole â€˜openâ€™ process?</p>
<p>I know some people find startup messages a bit annoying, but I think itâ€™s easy enough for users to opt out of seeing them with a call to <code>suppressPackageStartupMessages()</code>.</p>
<p>Mostly Iâ€™m kind of surprised by the lack of abuse of <code>packageStartupMessage()</code> in this sample. Let me know of any cheeky business you might have come across.</p>
