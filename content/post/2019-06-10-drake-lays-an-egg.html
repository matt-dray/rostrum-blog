<h1>RAP</h1>
<p><a href="https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/">Reproducible Analytical Pipelines</a> (RAP) is an approach to generating <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics">UK government’s statistical reports</a> that improves reproducibility, minimises errors and speeds up production.</p>
<p>RAP does away with the tangled webs of spreadsheets, copy-pasting errors and infernal <code>publication_FINAL-v2_md-comments_FINAL.docx</code> file naming. Instead, RAP encourages a script-based workflow that’s beefed up with stuff like version control, dependency management and automated testing.</p>
</div>
<div id="make" class="section level1">
<h1>Make</h1>
<p>Projects can become complicated as multiple inputs, script files and outputs build up.</p>
<p>You need to re-run code if any changes are made. Can you remember exactly which bits of code need to be re-run? Or will you have to re-run everything from scratch? The latter is especially tedious in a large project.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile">‘makefile’</a> can help you. In short, it’s a text file in which you write each step of your analysis in a recipe-like format. Dependencies between data, code and outputs are recorded.</p>
<p>Now when something changes, only the impacted steps will be re-executed. This saves compute time and means you don’t have to remember any dependencies yourself.</p>
</div>
<div id="drake-it-to-make-it" class="section level1">
<h1>{drake} it to make it</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ropensci/drake">{drake}</a> is a package by <a href="https://wlandau.github.io/">Will Landau</a> that lets you create makefiles using R syntax.</p>
<p>With {drake} you prepare a ‘plan’ script written in R that records all the functions to be executed. You then ‘make’ the plan to run all the steps of the analysis.</p>
<p>There’s some helpful material out there for learning more about {drake}:</p>

<h1>Eggsample</h1>
<p>I’ve made a very simple {drake} demo for an imaginary RAP project, which recreates a small part of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/egg-statistics">statistical publication that tracks UK egg production</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap">GitHub</a>, along with an <a href="https://matt-dray.github.io/drake-egg-rap/egg-report.html">HTML version of the demo report</a>.</p>
<div id="a-cunning-plan" class="section level2">
<h2>A cunning plan</h2>
<p>The repo contains <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/tree/master/R">a folder</a> with three simple but important scripts<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/R/packages.R"><code>packages.R</code></a> loads the packages we need for analysis using calls to <code>library()</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/R/functions.R"><code>functions.R</code></a> contains bespoke functions</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/R/plan.R"><code>plan.R</code></a> is the recipe document that brings everything together</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two don’t need much more explaining. The <code>plan.R</code> file is a little different but is straightforward. It contains a call to <code>drake::drake_plan()</code>, to which you pass the functions that make up your analysis:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plan &lt;- drake_plan(
  
  raw_data = read_ods(
    path = &quot;data/eggs-packers-02may19a.ods&quot;,
    sheet = &quot;Packers_Annual&quot;,
    skip = 8
  ),
  
  data = clean_data(raw_data),
  
  plot = create_plot(data),
  
  report = rmarkdown::render(
    knitr_in(&quot;egg-report.Rmd&quot;),
    output_file = file_out(&quot;docs/egg-report.html&quot;),
    quiet = TRUE
  )

)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="straight-from-the-source" class="section level2">
<h2>Straight from the source</h2>
<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/make.R">a simple file called <code>make.R</code> in the root</a> that reads each of .R script files using the <code>source()</code> function. The first two scripts simply load the packages and functions we need, while <code>source(plan.R)</code> generates a data frame<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> called ‘plan’.</p>
<p>This data frame has ‘target’ and ‘command’ columns and multiple rows. It’s like an instruction booklet that can be read ‘for each function we specified in the <code>plan.R</code> file, apply the named command to the named target’.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/R/plan.R">in my example</a> there are four instructions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the raw data (target) with <code>readODS::read_ods()</code> (command)</li>
<li>Clean the data (target) with our <code>clean_data()</code> function (command)</li>
<li>Plot the data (target) with our <code>plot_data()</code> function (command)</li>
<li>Create an R Markdown report (target) with <code>rmarkdown::render()</code> (command)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="enact-the-plan" class="section level2">
<h2>Enact the plan</h2>
<p>Now you can run the <code>make()</code> function on the ‘plan’ object, which will run the list of instructions in the plan.</p>
<p>The report will pop into existence and any created objects will be stored in a cache in a folder called ‘.drake’, which is hidden from the user.</p>
<p>Of course, re-running the plan again does… nothing. No code needs to be re-executed if nothing’s changed! {drake} will identify changes for you and re-execute only the dependent parts.</p>
<p>If, for example, a single data point changes, then the the plot and the report will be recreated, since they’re downstream of the data. Targets that aren’t impacted by the change won’t be re-run, since {drake} can just refer to the cache.</p>
<p>Incidentally, you can pull objects from the cache using the <code>loadd()</code> and <code>readd()</code> functions. For example, the R Markdown report in my example simply calls the plot object from the cache using <code>readd()</code>. This can help keep the R Markdown file less cluttered and more readable.</p>
</div>
<div id="visualise" class="section level2">
<h2>Visualise</h2>
<p>To help with this, {drake} provides a nice interactive visualisation of the dependencies and highlights which targets have changed (if any), and therefore which downstream dependencies will be impacted as a result.</p>
<p>First you generate ‘config’ file: a list object that contains lots of configuration information for your plan.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>egg_config &lt;- drake_config(plan)</code></pre>
<p>For example, <code>egg_config$cache_path</code> contains the filepath for where the cache is.</p>
<p>A number of {drake} functions can take the config object and do something with the information inside it. In our case, we’re going to pass the config to <code>vis_drake_graph()</code>, which builds an interactive dependency graph.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>vis_drake_graph(egg_config)</code></pre>
<p>[INSERT GRAPH]</p>
<p>This is handy for seeing dependencies at a glance. It’s shape-coded to show the target type (object, function, file) and colour-coded to show whether everything is up-to-date.</p>
<p>So if we change something in our analysis and re-view the graph without updating anything, we’ll see that the colour of the dependent steps has changed.</p>
