In this post I assume that you:

* want to version control your R project
* intend to store your version controlled files in the cloud with GitHub
* want to interact with Git via the command line, rather than a Graphical User Interface
* are using a Mac and will access the command line via Terminal, or a terminal tab in RStudio

# The command line

## Access

Open the Terminal application to chat directly to your computer. This is where we can access the **command line**. It looks prety simple, with just some lines of monospaced text. We'll write our instructions at the **prompt**, which is the form `computer-name:current-directory user $`:

```{bash}
mac:~ luigi$
```

The prompt will appear each time your computer is awaiting an instruction. You just need to write your command after thet `$` and hit enter.

## Where are we?

Any instructions you give will affect the current folder you're in. Where are you when you start Terminal? The prompt will show the tilde `~` in the current-directory part of the prompt. This is shortcut symbol for the **root directory**, which on a Mac will be set to the path `/Users/<your-username>`.

We can prove this by typing `pwd` ('print working directory') at the prompt and hitting the enter key.

```{bash, pwd}
mac:~ luigi$ pwd
/Users/luigi
```

## Who goes there?

Let's look around this folder with `ls`, which means 'list the files'.

```{bash, ls}
mac:~ luigi$ ls
Applications  Desktop   Desktop
Downloads     Movies    Music
Pictures      plumbing-invoice.txt  
```

## Flags

We can go one better: we can add *flags* to the command. These are arguments prefixed with a hyphen that change the command's default behaviour. We're going to ask for *all* the files and folders (some are hidden!) with `-a` and also we'll use `-p` to get the folders appended with a forward slash.

```{bash, ls-a-p}
mac:~ luigi$ ls -a -p
.
..
.Rprofile
Applications/
Desktop/
Desktop/
Downloads/
plumbing-invoice.txt
Movies/
Music/
Pictures/
```

So now can see all the files, including the hidden ones. These start with a period -- see [the `.Rprofile` file](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/01/04/rprofile-motivate/) for example.

## Navigation

Knowing what's in our working directory is useful because it helps us navigate. We can switch to another folder with the change directory command `cd`. We don't have to type the full path, just the path relative to where we are. So instead of `/Users/matt/Desktop`, we can just type `Desktop`.

```{bash, cd}
mac:~ luigi$ cd Desktop
mac:Desktop luigi$
```

See how the prompt changed to say 'Desktop'? This is a handy reference in case we forget where we are. To return to the parent folder (i.e. back where we were), we can use `cd ..` to go up the file structure by one level.

## Create a file

Let's create a file in our current working directory with the `touch` command and then convince ourselves it's there by listing the folder contents.

```{bash, touch}
mac:Desktop luigi$ touch characters.md
mac:Desktop luigi$ ls
characters.md
```

Okay great, but the file is empty. How do we write something in it? Well, you can use `open characters.md` to open the file in your default text editor, but we can also write from _inside Terminal_. Perhaps the simplest way is to use Nano, which you can think of as a text editor built into Terminal.

```{bash, nano-file}
mac:Desktop luigi$ nano characters.md
```
The prompt will disappear and you'll see a header saying `File: characters.md`. You're now editing this file. Start typing!

```{bash, nano-edit}
# Luigi's list of pals and not-pals

## The best

1. **Luigi**
2. Baby Luigi
3. Daisy

## The worst

1. Red Luigi
2. Waluigi
3. King Boo
```

Notice the options at the bottom screen. We can exit Nano with `^X` (control and X keys). You'll be asked if you want to save, hit `Y` for yes. Then you'll be asked for a `File name to write: characters.md`. You can edit the name or hit enter to confirm.
