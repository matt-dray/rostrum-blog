In this post I assume that you:

* want to version control your R project
* intend to store your version controlled files in the cloud with GitHub
* want to interact with Git via the command line, rather than a Graphical User Interface
* are using a Mac and will access the command line via Terminal, or a terminal tab in RStudio

# The command line

You can chat directly to your computer using the **command line**, which youc an acces on your MAc with the Terminal application. Hit the command and space keys to open Spotlight and search for 'terminal'.

It looks pretty basic. Just some lines of monospaced text. The line ending with the `$` symbol and a provocative grey box is the **prompt** -- an invitation to talk to your computer friend.

Any instructions you give will affect the current folder you're in. What's the current directory when you start Terminal? It's the **root directory**, which for me is set to the path `/Users/matt`. We can prove this by typing `pwd` ('print working directory') at the prompt and hitting the enter key.

```{bash, pwd}
$ pwd
```

```
/Users/matt
```

Let's look around this folder with `ls`, which means 'list the files'.

```{bash, ls}
$ ls
```
```
Applications  Desktop      Documents
Downloads     example.txt  Movies
Music         Pictures
```

We can go one better: we can add *flags* to the command. These are arguments prefixed with a hyphen that change the default behaviour of the command. We're going to ask for *all* the files and folders (some are hidden!) with `-a` and also we'll use `-p` to get the folders appended with a forward slash.

```{bash, ls-a-p}
$ ls -a -p
```
```
.
..
.Rprofile
Applications/
Desktop/
Documents/
Downloads/
example.txt
Movies/
Music/
Pictures/
```
So now can see all the files, including the hidden ones. These start with a period -- see [the `.Rprofile` file](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/01/04/rprofile-motivate/) for example. The two lines containing *just* periods relate to navigation: `.` refers to the current directory and `..` refers to the **parent folder** that contains the current folder.

Knowing what's in our working directory is useful because it helps us navigate. We can switch to another folder with the change directory command `cd`. We don't have to type the full path, just the path relative to where we are. So instead of `/Users/matt/Documents`, we can just type `Documents`.

```{bash, cd}
$ cd Documents
```
See how the prompt changed to say 'Documents'? This is a handy reference in case we forget where we are. To return to the parent folder (i.e. back where we were), we can use `cd ..` to go up the file structure by one level.
