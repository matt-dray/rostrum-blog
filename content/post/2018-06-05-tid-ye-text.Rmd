# Genius?

Kanye West released his latest album -- [*ye*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_(album)) -- last week[^1] after a(nother) pretty turbulent and controversial period of his life[^2]. So what's been on his mind?

I think the real question is why don't we scrape Yeezus's lyrics from the web and analyse them using R? Obviously.

# Genius

[Genius](https://genius.com/) is a website where you can upload and comment on song lyrics. It's like [Pop Up Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vam8l-JtqcI) for young people.

You can access the lyrics data via Genius's API[^3]. Luckily, the [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) package [`genuisr`](https://github.com/ewenme/geniusr) was developed by [Ewen Henderson](https://ewen.io/) for exactly this purpose.[^4] 

# Access the API

You need to register with Genius so you can get tokens for accessing their API. To do this:

1. [Create a new Genius API client](https://genius.com/api-clients/new).
2. Click 'generate access token' under 'client access token' to generate an access token.
3. After `install.packages("geniusr")`, `library(geniusr)` you'll be prompted to enter the access token when you try to use a `geniusr` function

I stored the token in my .Renviron file. This is a file for store variables that R will look for and load automatically on startup. Edit the file on your system by running `usethis::edit_r_environ()` and adding the line `GENIUS_API_TOKEN=X`, replacing X with your token.

If you don't store your token this way then you'll be prompted for a new token every time you start a new R session, which could get quite tedious. It also means you don't have to store it in plain sight

# Use `geniusr`

## Find Kanye

First we need to find the artist ID for Kanye. We can use `search_artist()` to look for him.

```{r get_artist_id}
library(geniusr)  # access genius api
library(dplyr)  # manipulate data
library(knitr)  # pretty table printing

geniusr::search_artist("kanye west") %>% 
  knitr::kable()  # prints the table nice
```

Kanye's ID on Genius is 72 as a solo artist. We can save this value as the object `kanye_id` and use it to get metadata about him. This includes the web address for his artist page on Genius, a link to the image of him used on the site and the number of people 'following' his lyrics page.

```{r get_artist_meta}
# artist ID
kanye_id <- 72

# access meta info
artist_meta <- geniusr::get_artist_meta(
  artist_id = kanye_id
)

# preview
dplyr::glimpse(artist_meta)
```

## Get songs

Now we can use Kanye's artist ID to obtain *all* his songs on Genius.

```{r get_songs}
# get all songs for a given artist id
kanye_songs <- geniusr::get_artist_songs(
  artist_id = kanye_id
)

# a random preview
dplyr::sample_n(kanye_songs, 10) %>%
  dplyr::select(song_name) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

We can also access a greater list of data for each song, including the album name and release date. We can use the `map_df` function from the `purrr` package to look for the meta data for each song in turn. 

```{r get_song_meta}
library(purrr)  # functional programming

# apply function over each song id
songs_meta <- purrr::map_df(
  kanye_songs$song_id,
  geniusr::get_song_meta
)

# a random preview
dplyr::sample_n(songs_meta, 10) %>% 
  dplyr::select(song_name, album_name) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Looking at the album names, it seems we've got songs from 37 albums at least plus a bunch that are unknown or unclassified.

```{r unique_albums}
# the songs are from which albums?
unique(songs_meta$album_name)
```

So you can see *ye* is definitely in the list of albums and we can filter our data frame so we just get the seven tracks from that particular album. Maybe we'll explore the other lyrics more deeply another day.

```{r just_ye_album}
# filter songs from album 'ye'
ye <- songs_meta %>% 
  dplyr::filter(album_name == "ye")

# preview songs
dplyr::select(ye, song_name)
```

We can fecth the lyrics from Genius for each song now that we have their details. We can do this using `map_df()` again to apply the `scrape_lyrics_url()` function to each row of our dataframe, where each row represents a single song. 

```{r ye_get_lyrics}
# get lyrics
ye_lyrics <- purrr::map_df(
  ye$song_lyrics_url,
  geniusr::scrape_lyrics_url
)

# join additional information
ye_lyrics <- ye_lyrics %>%
  dplyr::group_by(song_name) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(line_number = row_number()) %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(ye, by = "song_name")

# check out a sample of lines
ye_lyrics %>% 
  dplyr::sample_n(10) %>% 
  dplyr::select(line, song_name) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

# Break the lyrics down

## Words

### Extract

Now we've got the lines separated, we can bring in [the `tidytext` package from Julia Silge and David Robinson](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html) to break the lines into 'tokens' for further text analysis. Tokens are individual units of text prepared for analysis. In our case, we're looking at individual words, or 'unigrams'.

We should probabaly remove stop words. These are words don't really have much meaning in this context because of their ubiquity, like 'if', 'and' and 'but'. We can get rid of these by anti-joining a pre-prepared list of such words.

```{r word_per_row}
library(tidytext)  # wrangle text

ye_words <- ye_lyrics %>%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, line) %>%  # separate the tokens out
  dplyr::anti_join(tidytext::stop_words)  # remove words like 'if', 'and', 'but'

dplyr::sample_n(ye_words, 10) %>% 
  dplyr::select(word, song_name) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Note that this isn't *completely* successful. Kanye also uses colloquialisms and words like 'ima'; a contraction of two stop words that isn't represented in our stop-word dictionary.

### Count words

Now we've tokenised the lyrics to removed stopwords, we can just do a simple count of each one. I've shown this in an interactive table.

```{r count_words_table}
library(DT)  # interactive tables

ye_words %>%
  dplyr::count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  DT::datatable(
    options = list(
      autoWidth = TRUE,
      pageLength = 10
    )
  )
```

Let's also show this as a plot. For simplicity, we'll show only the words that appeared more than five times.

I've [sampled](https://labs.tineye.com/color/89f0ded96fcba23fc468e24e65503fa1370b5e67?ignore_background=True&ignore_interior_background=True&width=250&height=246&scroll_offset=514) seven colours from the album cover of *ye*, stored as hexadecimal values in a vector that's part of the `dray` package. We can select from these to decorate our plot, because why not. [The album cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/Ye_album_cover.jpg) is a Wyoming mountainscape, taken on Kanye's own iPhone shortly before he held a listening party for the new album. Scrawled in green lettering over the image is the phrase 'I hate being Bi-Polar it's awesome'. ([You can create your own version.](https://yenerator.com/))

```{r ye_cols}
#devtools::install_github("matt-dray/dray")
library(dray)  # for ye_cols
dray::ye_cols  # see the named colours
```

Okay, on with the plot.

```{r plot_word_freq}
library(ggplot2)  # plots

ye_words %>%
  dplyr::count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%  # tally words
  dplyr::filter(n > 5) %>%  # more than5 occurrences 
  dplyr::mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%  # order by count
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col(fill = ye_cols["mountain_blue"]) +
  labs(
    title = "Frequency of words in 'ye' (2018) by Kanye West",
    subtitle = "Using the geniusr and tidytext packages",
    x = "", y = "Count",
    caption = "Lyrics from genius.com"
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(  # apply ye theming
    plot.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols["cloud_white"]),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = ye_cols["cloud_white"]),
    plot.caption = element_text(colour = ye_cols["cloud_blue1"]),
    axis.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols["text_green"]),
    axis.text = element_text(colour = ye_cols["text_green"]),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols["grass_blue"]),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols["cloud_grey"]),
    panel.grid = element_line(ye_cols["cloud_grey"])
  )
```

## Bigrams

### Extract

Tokenising by individual words is fine, but we aren't restricted to unigrams. We can also tokenise by *bigrams*, which are pairs of adjacent words. For example, 'damn croissant' is a bigram in the sentence 'hurry up with my damn croissaint'.

```{r count_bigrams_table}
ye_bigrams <- ye_lyrics %>%
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(
    bigram,
    line,
    token = "ngrams",
    n = 2
  )
```

Removing stopwords is tricker than for tokenising by word. We should tokenise by bigram first, then separate the words and match them to our stopword list.

```{r bigrams_remove_stopwords}
library(tidyr)  # to isolate bigram words

ye_bigrams_separated <- ye_bigrams %>%
  tidyr::separate(
    bigram,
    c("word1", "word2"),
    sep = " "
  )
```

Then we can filter to remove the stopwords.

```{r filter_stopwords}
ye_bigrams_filtered <- ye_bigrams_separated %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    !word1 %in% tidytext::stop_words$word,
    !word2 %in% tidytext::stop_words$word
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(bigram = paste(word1, word2))
```

The results look a bit like this:

```{r sample_bigrams}
sample_n(ye_bigrams_filtered, 10) %>% 
  dplyr::select(bigram, song_name)
```

### Count bigrams

So let's count the most frequent bigram occurrences, like we did for the single words.

```{r}
ye_bigrams_filtered %>%
  dplyr::mutate(bigram = as.factor(bigram)) %>% 
  dplyr::count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  DT::datatable(
    options = list(
      autoWidth = TRUE,
      pageLength = 10
    )
  )
```

And once again we can plot this with our *ye* theming.

```{r}
ye_bigrams_filtered %>%
  dplyr::count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::filter(n > 3) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(bigram = reorder(bigram, n)) %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(bigram, n)) +
  geom_col(fill = ye_cols["mountain_blue"]) +
  labs(
    title = "Frequency of bigrams in 'ye' (2018) by Kanye West",
    subtitle = "Using the geniusr and tidytext packages",
    x = "", y = "Count",
    caption = "Lyrics from genius.com"
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(  # apply ye theming
    plot.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols["cloud_white"]),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = ye_cols["cloud_white"]),
    plot.caption = element_text(colour = ye_cols["cloud_blue1"]),
    axis.title = element_text(colour = ye_cols["text_green"]),
    axis.text = element_text(colour = ye_cols["text_green"]),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols["grass_blue"]),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = ye_cols["cloud_grey"]),
    panel.grid = element_line(ye_cols["cloud_grey"])
  )
```

## What did we learn?

It's difficult to get a deep insight from looking at individual words from a 24-minute, seven-song album. You might argue that looking for deep insight from Kanye West's lyrics is a fool's errand anyway.

Despite this, 'love' and 'feel' were in the top 10, which might indicate Kanye expressing his feelings. 'Bad', 'mistake' and 'pray' were also repeated a bunch of times, which might also indicate what's on Ye's mind. 

Most of the other most common words should probably have been removed as stop words but weren't in our stop-word dictionary (e.g. 'yeah', 'mhm', 'i'ma', 'gon', 'ayy', 'wanna'). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the flexibility of 'shit' and 'fuck' means they're pretty high up the list.

We've seen how simple it is to use the `geniusr` functions `search_artist()`, `get_artist_meta()`, `get_artist_songs()`, `get_songs_meta()` `and scrape_lyrics_url()` in conjunction with `purrr`, followed by some `tidytext`.

The next step might be to look at Ye's entire back catalogue and see how his lyrics have changed over time and how they compare to `ye` in particular.

Obviously I only made this post for the 'tid-ye-text' pun, so take it or leave it.
