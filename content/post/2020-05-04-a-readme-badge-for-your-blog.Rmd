# tl;dr

Sometimes a post on this blog is related to some code in a GitHub repository. I wanted to create a metadata badge to link from that repo to the relevant post.

I've written [a package with a single function](https://github.com/matt-dray/badgr)---`badgr::get_badge()`---that generates a URL for a [shields.io](https://shields.io) metadata badge, which can then be placed in a repo's README.

Here's what the badge looks like:

# What's a metadata badge?

You'll see badges in the README files of code repositories on sites like GitHub and GitLab. They communicate something about the code at-a-glance and usually contain a link to further information.

</div>

Dynamic badges help you judge the status of the repo. For example, a common badge is one that indicates whether the code has passed testing via a continuous integration service like Travis. So 'build passing' means that the code in the latest update is working. Clicking the badge will take you to the associated site to get more information.

Other badges are static and can act as a handy link. For example, some repos have badges for services like [Ko-Fi](https://help.ko-fi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021025553-How-to-add-a-Ko-fi-button-to-GitHub) for donations, or perhaps to [open the repo in a cloud-based instance of Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/badges.html).

# Roll your own

You can create your own badges for whatever purpose.

I want people to know if one of my GitHub repositories is related to a post on this blog so they can find out more. I could just link to the post in the README---I often do---but the badge sits at the top of the README and is eye-catching. It's also a useful at-a-glance reminder for me when I'm looking over my repos.

You can see this badge (and others) in action in [my repo for the {oystr} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/oystr/blob/master/README.md), for example. The rest of this post lays out how you can build one for yourself.

## shields.io

Fortunately, There's a service called [shields.io](https://shields.io/) that makes it easy to create a simple badge. It works by exposing a badge with parameters you provide in a URL string.

You can generate a simple static badge by modifying a URL string in the form `https://img.shields.io/badge/<LABEL>-<MESSAGE>-<COLOR>`.

So `![](https://img.shields.io/badge/label-message-red)` results in this:

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/label-message-red)

You could build on this by providing an alternative style and an image from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/).

For example, `![](https://img.shields.io/badge/label-message-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)` results in this:

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/label-message-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)

So you can see that additional 'arguments' to the basic call are added after a `?` and then additional parts added with an `&`.

I'm not affiliated with shields.io. Find out more from
their [website](https://shields.io/),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Shields_io),
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HjJCwm5) or go to [the source
code](https://github.com/badges/shields). If you find their service useful, you can [donate](https://opencollective.com/shields).

## {badgr}

This got me thinking about a quick R function to build up a badge URL. This became [the `get_badge()` function in the {badgr} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/badgr). This is currently a bit janky and untested, but so far it does what I want it to do.

You can install it with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_githb("matt-dray/badgr")
```

`get_badge()` builds up the components of a shields.io-valid URL given the arguments you provide. For example, you can specify the text (`label` and `message` arguments) and background colour to go on either side of the badge (`label_color` and `color`). You can also include a logo from [simpleicons.org](http://simpleicons.org/) (`logo_simple`) or a custom icon of your choosing (`logo_path`).

The most complex part is that the path to the custom logo has to be base64-encoded, which is done with `base64enc::base64encode()`. The output from that is then passed into the shields.io URL.

By default, the function wraps your badge in Markdown in the form `[![](<shields.io URL>)](<provided link>)` and copies it to your clipboard, ready for you to paste it into a README somewhere. It also sends the URL to your browser for a preview.

### A rostrum.blog badge

So, I made a badge that has:

* 'rostrum.blog' on the left side, with a black background
* 'post' on the right side with a green background (to match the green used on this site)
* the rostrum.blog 'bug' logo gif (used as the favicon for the site)

I achieved that with the following code:

```{r}
# Set path to custom logo (a gif in this case)
logo <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/master/static/images/favicon.gif"

# Set underlying badge link (where the badge-click will take you)
link <- "https://www.rostrum.blog/"

blog_badge <- badgr::get_badge(
  label = "rostrum.blog",   # left-side text
  message = "post",         # right-side text
  color = "008900",         # left-side colour (green)
  label_color = "black",    # right_side colour
  md_link = link,           # where to go when clicked
  logo_path = logo,         # path to my logo
  browser_preview = FALSE,  # don't open preview
  to_clipboard = FALSE      # don't copy to clipboard
)
```

That results in the following string output:

```{r}
blog_badge
```

This is a shields.io-valid URL encased in some Markdown that allows it to be pasted directly into a GitHub README, for example.

It looks like this when rendered:

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/rostrum.blog-post-008900?style=flat&labelColor=black&logo=data:image/gif;base64,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)](https://www.rostrum.blog/)

Note that clicking the badge in a README will link to wherever you set in the `md_link` argument. For some reason, the rendering inside this blog means that the badge contains the link, but you can't click on the badge area to visit it. `r emo::ji("shrug")` 

To see the badge in the wild, you can see it in my repos for:

* [the {altcheckr} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/altcheckr/blob/master/README.md)
* [an example of {drake} for reproducible workflows](https://github.com/matt-dray/drake-egg-rap/blob/master/README.md)
* [tidyswirl, a demo {swirl} course for the tidyverse](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl)

And many others.
