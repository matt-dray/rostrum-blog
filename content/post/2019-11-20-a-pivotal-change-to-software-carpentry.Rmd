# Instructor

I passed [the requirements](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/) to become a  [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) trainer, which ‘teach[es] foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide’ as part of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) initiative.

I wrote about part of this experience in [a post about live coding](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/09/12/live-code/) ([cross-posted on The Carpentries blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/09/live-coding-experience/)). The ‘code-along’ format is an important part of the teaching approach for The Carpentries.

# Contribution

One of the instructor assessment requirements is to make a contribution to improve the teaching materials. This can be as simple as raising an issue on GitHub or offering a pull request (PR) to merge in new or amended content.

I made a [very small PR](https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/pull/569) to correct a small problem with bullet points, but I had [a more substantial suggestion that I raised in in an issue](https://github.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/issues/570): to update the entire episode about [{tidyr}](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/), a [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package used for reshaping data frames.

# Pivot

Why? Since {tidyr} [version 1.0.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/tidyr-1-0-0/), the `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` functions have replaced the `spread()` and `gather()` functions. 

These functions switch data between a ‘wide’ and ‘long’ forms form. For example, a long data set might have a column called ‘year’ and a column called ‘population’. A wide version would have separate columns named for each year (‘1994’, ‘1995’, etc) that each contained that year’s ‘population’ figures.

`pivot_wider()` can spread the long data into the wide form and `pivot_longer()` does the opposite. You can learn more in [the {tidyr} vignette about pivoting](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html).
