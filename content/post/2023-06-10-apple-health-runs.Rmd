# tl;dr

You can use R to extract running details from a downloaded of your Apple Health data. My old code broke, so I re-wrote it.

# On your marks

In 2021 [I extracted my running activities from my Apple Health data](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/03/23/xml-health/) using [the {xml2} package](https://xml2.r-lib.org/). You can read there for some theory and background.

At that point I'd been running for one year. I'm nearly at 500 runs[^fivehundo], so I thought I would re-execute my code with the latest data. Alas, the original code no longer works because Apple seems to have updated the format of the XML file they provide.

So I've written a new function that takes a path to the zipped download of my Apple Health data and outputs a dataframe of time and distance data, with one row per run.

# Get set

I followed [the same steps as before](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/03/23/xml-health/#warm-up) to get my Apple Health data off my phone.

I smashed together a quick function to unzip the file to a temporary location and then extract workout data using the [the {xml2} package](https://xml2.r-lib.org/). There's a bit of base R wrangling to output a dataframe with a row per run workout, focusing on total time and distance.

```{r fn-declare}
get_run_distances <- function(zip_path) {
  
  # Unzip Apple Health export to temporary location
  message("Unzipping and reading XML")
  temp <- tempdir()
  unzip(zipfile = zip_path, exdir = temp)
  xml_in <- xml2::read_xml(file.path(temp, "apple_health_export", "export.xml"))
  unlink(temp)
  
  # Isolate workouts only and convert to an R list object
  message("Isolating workouts from XML")
  wo_in <- xml2::xml_find_all(xml_in, "//Workout") |> xml2::as_list()
  
  # Pre-allocate a list to be filled with output data
  wo_total <- length(wo_in)
  wo_out <- vector("list", wo_total)
  
  # For each viable workout, extract the details
  message("Iterating over workouts to extract run data")
  for (wo_n in seq(wo_total)) {
    
    # Extract details for current workout
    wo <- wo_in[[wo_n]]
    wo_attrs <- attributes(wo)  # the data is stored as attributes
    is_run <- 
      wo_attrs[["workoutActivityType"]] == "HKWorkoutActivityTypeRunning"
    
    # If the workout wasn't a run, then skip to the next workout
    if (!is_run) next
    
    # if it is a run, then extract the data to a single-row dataframe
    if (is_run) {
      
      # There can be more than one element named 'WorkoutStatistics'. We want to 
      # get the one with distance information and extract the details.
      wo_stats <- wo[grep("WorkoutStatistics", names(wo))]
      wo_stats_types <- lapply(wo_stats, \(x) attr(x, c("type")))
      dist_type <- "HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDistanceWalkingRunning"
      dist_index <- which(wo_stats_types == dist_type)
      wo_dist <- wo_stats[[dist_index]]
      
      # Prepare single-row dataframe and add to the pre-allocated list
      wo_details <- data.frame(
        source = wo_attrs[["sourceName"]],
        start = as.POSIXct(wo_attrs[["startDate"]]),
        end = as.POSIXct(wo_attrs[["endDate"]]),
        distance_km = attr(wo_dist, "sum") |> as.numeric() |> round(2)
      )
      wo_details[["duration_s"]] <- 
        as.numeric(wo_details[["end"]] - wo_details[["start"]], units = "secs")
      wo_out[[wo_n]] <- wo_details
      
    }
    
  }
  
  # Convert to dataframe, select columns
  message("Combining data")
  wo_out_df <- do.call(rbind, wo_out)
  wo_out_df[, c("source", "start", "end", "duration_s", "distance_km")]
  
}
```

I won't go through it line by line, but there's some commentary to explain what's happening at each step. It does what I need it to do for now, but no doubt there's some refactoring to be done. 

There's a few things to note:

* I'm more comfortable handling R objects, so I converted early to a list with `xml2::as_list()`. Awkwardly, the data in the list object was stored as [attributes](https://xml2.r-lib.org/) to each element.
* The distance data is stored in an element called 'WorkoutStatistics', but more than one element will have this name. We first have to isolate the element that is of the correct type, which has the name 'HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDistanceWalkingRunning'.
* I converted the start and end variables to datetime class (POSIXct) and subtracted one from the other to get the duration of the run. This yields the 'difftime' class that can be converted to seconds with `as.numeric()` and the argument `units = "secs"`.
* There's no input handling, because this was quick and for 'fun', lol.

# Go

So, to use the function you pass a path to where your zipped Apple Health export lives. Mine is in my 'Downloads' folder.

```{r cache=TRUE}
runs <- get_run_distances("~/Downloads/export.zip")
```

I recorded all my runs with the Nike Run Club app, so I'll filter out duplicates where I dual-recorded with Apple's Workout app. I think I accidentally started the app by mistake a couple of times, so we'll only grab runs of over 1 km. I'll also convert the seconds to a friendlier-looking 'period' class using [{lubridate}](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)[^lubridate].

Here's the most recent few:

```{r}
runs <- runs[runs$source == "Nike Run Club" & runs$distance_km > 1, ]
runs$duration <- lubridate::seconds_to_period(runs$duration_s)
runs <- runs[, c("start", "distance_km", "duration")]
row.names(runs) <- NULL
tail(runs)
```

For my own tracking purposes, I've run:

* `r nrow(runs)` times
* for a total distance of `r round(sum(runs$distance_km))` km
* for a total duration of about `r round(sum(as.numeric(runs$duration)) / 60 / 60 / 24, 0)` days

And I can recreate one of the plots from the old post while we're here:

```{r}
plot(
  x = runs$start, 
  y = runs$distance_km, 
  las = 1,  # rotate y-axis labels
  main = "Runs captured with Nike Run Club in Apple Health",
  xlab = "Date",
  ylab = "Distance (km)"
)
```

Some patterns are obvious. For example, there's lots of 5 km runs until about mid-2021, when it hops to more like 7 km. That's when I started running for 30 mins at a time, rather than for 5 km specifically.

I'm pretty happy at these two distances, obviously, but maybe I should do more 21.1 km half-marathons. Or a full marathon? No no, that's foolish: it would expand my y-axis too much and make it harder to observe patterns at shorter distances, amirite.

[^lubridate]: {lubridate} is handy for time handling for many reasons. Here it's helpful because it can resolve minutes and seconds (e.g. `21M 30S`) instead of the decimal minutes (e.g. `21.5`) in a difftime object.
[^fivehundo]: Yeah, I could've waited to post this after I'd actually reached 500 runs, but I like arbitrary chaos.
