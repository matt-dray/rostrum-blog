# tl;dr

[The {r.oguelike} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike)---a toy roguelike game for the R console---now has sound effects [thanks to {sonify}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sonify). Pew pew!

# The adventure continues?

This is apparently episode 5 of the {r.oguelike} [devlog](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/devlog). You can read earlier posts about:

* [its inception](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/04/25/r.oguelike-dev/)
* [creating simple procedural dungeons](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/05/01/dungeon/)
* [making the enemy chase the player](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/06/10/basic-search/)
* [moving the tiles into the third dimension](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/06/28/isometric-dungeon/)

Alas, this is also probably the last installment. The package has reached version 0.1  and was always intended as a proof of concept (i.e. for the lols). 

Ultimately, the dungeons are dank (i.e. cool and edgy), but also they are dank (i.e. cool and damp) and mildly claustrophobic.

There may be time for a {r.oguelike2} in future. I'd like to try a class-based approach to help limit code spaghetti and make it more extensible. Perhaps it will even have a proper game loop! Call me when you're ready, Nintendo.

Until then, beeeeeeep beeeeeeep BEEEEEEEP.

# Hi-Sonifi

Anyway, yes: {r.oguelike} now has sound effects with quality as high as its graphics and gameplay.

I used [the {sonify} package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sonify) to create little beeps and toots that I think fit the game's aesthetic. These are fired as the player moves and interacts with things in the dungeon.

I've written about {sonify} before when I sonified data about [COVID-19 infections](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/02/02/sonify-covid/) and [GitHub activity](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/02/21/skyphone/) (incredible juxtaposition). 

Basically you can make an audible plot, which offers a more interesting and accessible way of presenting data. A bell curve will sound like woooOOOOooop, for example.

You can also hijack {sonify} to make funny little honks and parps, which is what I've done for {r.oguelike}. [I wrote about this for {ActionSquirrel}](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/10/03/squirrel/), a sort-of proto-{r.oguelike}.

How did I arrive at the sounds for {r.oguelike}? I did the bare minimum of fiddling around with the arguments in `sonify::sonify()` until the noises amused me.

# Demo cassette

The outputs are [{tuneR}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tuneR) objects, which I've saved as wav files with `tuneR::writeWav()` so they can be embedded below.

In reality, the sounds play a little slower in the game, but it was a bit fiddly to reproduce it for these clips. You get the idea.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(sonify)
library(tuneR)
library(purrr)

sfx <- list(
  
  move = sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.001),
  
  bump = sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.01, flim = c(100, 110)),
  
  gold = bind(
    sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.05, flim = c(800, 800)),
    sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.05, flim = c(1000, 1000))
  ),
  
  apple = sonify(0:1, c(0, 1), duration = 0.05),
  
  eat = sonify(0:1, c(1, 0), duration = 0.05),
  
  win = bind(
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600)),
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600)),
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(800, 800))
  ),
  
  lose = bind(
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600)),
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600)),
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(400, 400))
  )
  
)

walk2(
  .x = sfx,
  .y = names(sfx), 
  ~writeWave(.x, paste0(.y, ".wav"))
)
```

## Move

If you move onto an unoccupied floor tile (`.`), you get a very quick 'tap' like a footstep.

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/move.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.001)
```

## Bump

Bump into the dungeon wall (`#`) and you'll get a dull thud, you absolute clod.

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/bump.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.01, flim = c(100, 110))
```

Yes, `flim`, as in: 'this post is absolute flimflam'.

## Gold

Collect gold (`$`) and get a celebratory ding.

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/gold.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.05, flim = c(800, 800))
sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.05, flim = c(1000, 1000))
```

## Apple

A cartoony sound for picking up the apple (`a`).

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/apple.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(0:1, c(0, 1), duration = 0.05),
```

## Eat

A swallowing noise as the apple (`a`) heads down your gullet.

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/eat.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(0:1, c(1, 0), duration = 0.05)
```

## Defeat enemy

A powerful victory ditty after you crush your enemies (`E`).

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/win.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600))
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600))
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(800, 800))
```

## Lose

Conversely, a sad lament for being crushed by your enemies (`E`).

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/lose.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600))
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600))
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(400, 400))
```
