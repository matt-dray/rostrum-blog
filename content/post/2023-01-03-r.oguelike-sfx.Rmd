# tl;dr

[The {r.oguelike} package](https://github.com/matt-dray/r.oguelike)---a toy roguelike microadventure for the R console---now has little sound effects [thanks to {sonify}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sonify). Pew pew!

# The adventure continues?

Apparently this is part 5 of the {r.oguelike} [devlog](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/devlog). You can read earlier posts about:

* [its inception](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/04/25/r.oguelike-dev/)
* [creating simple procedural dungeons](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/05/01/dungeon/)
* [making an enemy chase the player](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/06/10/basic-search/)
* [3D dungeons and continuous keypress inputs](https://www.rostrum.blog/2022/06/28/isometric-dungeon/)

Alas, this is also probably the last installment. 

Yes, the dungeons have been dank (cool, edgy), but also _dank_ (cool, damp, claustrophobic). Time to unspelunk myself.

There may be time for a {r.oguelike2} in future. I'd like to try a class-based approach to help limit code spaghetti and make it more extensible. Perhaps it will even have a proper game loop! Call me when you're ready, Kojima.

Until then, one more little feature to tie things up. Beeeeeeep. BOOOOOOOP.

# Hi-Sonifi

So, yes: {r.oguelike} now has sound effects with quality as high as its graphics and gameplay. See all these in concert in the video embedded at the top of this page.

I used [the {sonify} package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sonify) to create a few little beeps and toots that I think fit the game's retro aesthetic.[^mikefc] These are fired when the player moves and interacts with things in the dungeon.

I've written about {sonify} before when I sonified data about [COVID-19 infections](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/02/02/sonify-covid/) and [GitHub activity](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/02/21/skyphone/) (incredible juxtaposition), which can offer a more interesting and accessible way of presenting data.

You can also demean {sonify} by making funny little honks and parps, which is what I've done for {r.oguelike}.

How did I arrive at the soundscape for {r.oguelike}? I did the bare minimum of fiddling around with the arguments in `sonify::sonify()` until the noises amused me.

# Demo cassette

Sounds are played in the code of the package via functions after each triggering event. The user can prevent these sounds from playing with the logical `has_sfx` argument in the `start_game()` function.

For example, here's the function for the simplest sound effect:

```{r eval=FALSE}
.sfx_move <- function(has_sfx) {
  if (has_sfx) sonify::sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.001)
}
```

The `sonify()` outputs are [{tuneR}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tuneR) objects. I've saved these as wav files with `tuneR::writeWav()` so they can be embedded in this post.

<details><summary>Click for illustrative code to create the wav files.</summary>

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(sonify)
library(tuneR)
library(purrr)

sfx <- list(
  
  move = sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.001),
  
  bump = sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.01, flim = c(100, 110)),
  
  gold = bind(
    sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.05, flim = c(800, 800)),
    sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.05, flim = c(1000, 1000))
  ),
  
  apple = sonify(0:1, c(0, 1), duration = 0.05),
  
  eat = sonify(0:1, c(1, 0), duration = 0.05),
  
  win = bind(
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600)),
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600)),
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(800, 800))
  ),
  
  lose = bind(
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600)),
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600)),
    sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(400, 400))
  )
  
)

walk2(
  .x = sfx,
  .y = names(sfx), 
  ~writeWave(.x, paste0(.y, ".wav"))
)
```

In reality, the sounds play a little slower in the game itself, but it was a bit fiddly to reproduce it for these clips. You'll get the idea.

## Move

Step onto unoccupied floor tile (`.`) and you'll hear the very quick tap of your boot.

Click to play the sound:

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/move.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

And here's the corresponding code to reproduce it:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.001)
```

But bump into the dungeon wall (`#`) and you'll get a dull thud, you absolute clod.

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/bump.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.01, flim = c(100, 110))
```

Yes, `flim`, as in: 'this post is absolute flimflam'.

## Food

Would you pick up an apple (`a`) you found on the floor of a cave? Here's what it might sound like as it pops into your inventory.

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/apple.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(0:1, c(0, 1), duration = 0.05),
```

More importantly, would you eat an apple (`a`) you found on the floor of a cave? Here's how it would sound as it rolls down your gullet.

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/eat.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(0:1, c(1, 0), duration = 0.05)
```

## Gold

Collecting gold (`$`) grants you a celebratory chirp of excitement. Although there's not actually anything in the dungeon to spend it on, sorry.

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/gold.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.05, flim = c(800, 800))
sonify(1, 1, duration = 0.05, flim = c(1000, 1000))
```

## Defeat enemy

A powerful victory ditty after you crush your enemies (`E`).

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/win.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600))
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600))
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(800, 800))
```

## Lose

Conversely, a sad lament for being crushed by your enemies (`E`) or running out of turns (`T`).

<html><audio controls><source src="/output/rogue-sfx/lose.wav" type="audio/wav"></audio></html>

```{r eval=FALSE}
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600))
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(600, 600))
sonify(0:1, rep(1, 2), duration = 0.1, flim = c(400, 400))
```

If you want to try out {r.oguelike}, you can install it from GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.github("remotes")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/r.oguelike")  # v0.1 currently
r.oguelike::start_game()
```

You can also [run {r.oguelike} in an RStudio instance in your browser](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/matt-dray/play-r.oguelike/main?urlpath=rstudio) (!), thanks to [the Binder project](https://mybinder.org/).

Free feel to highlight any bugs via [the issues](https://github.com/matt-dray/rostrum-blog/issues), or create a pull request that adds all the things that stop me from calling {r.oguelike} a proper 'game'.[^game]

Most importantly, don't forget to wishlist me on Steam and remember that pre-order bonuses will include an apple that's been left on a dungeon floor for a few months.
