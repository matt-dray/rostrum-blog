<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/monetize">The {monetize} R package</a> gives you inspiration for monetising your R package. Developers rise up!</p>
</div>
<div id="free-as-in-free" class="section level1">
<h1>Free as in free</h1>
<p>There’s one good reason why SAS, SPSS and Stata<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> are such successful and beloved statistical tools: money.</p>
<p>For some reason, R remains free and open source. But what if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)">Ihaka &amp; Gentleman</a> originally wanted users to be charged a literal (New Zealand) dollar<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> every time they use the <code>$</code> symbol to access an element from an object? I’m just asking the question!</p>
<p>Us package developers should seize the initiative and harvest the sweet, sweet bounty of our labour. But how? I will tell you the secret!</p>
</div>
<div id="free-as-in-not-quite" class="section level1">
<h1>Free as in not quite</h1>
<p>Introducing the {monetize} R package! It will provide the inspiration you seek. Serious entrepreneurs can <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/monetize">install from GitHub</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;)  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github(&quot;matt-dray/monetize&quot;)
library(monetize)</code></pre>
<pre><code>Welcome to the monetize(TM) package FREE TRIAL version!
Try our EXCLUSIVE add_one() function!
Try watch_ad() to gain MEGA COINS and increase your MEMBER LEVEL for REWARDS!
And now a quick message from our sponsor:
  🧃 IMBIBE ACME(TM)-BRAND FRUIT PULP (7% FEWER INSECT COMPONENTS)! 🪳</code></pre>
<p>The package contains the exclusive <code>add_one()</code> function, which surprisingly doesn’t come pre-installed with base R. A gap in the market!</p>
<p>Users should speculate to accumulate, so there’s a small cost to use the function. In {monetize}, each use of a function costs 1 MEGA COIN.</p>
<p>Because I am so kind, I have chosen for users to receive a 30-day FREE TRIAL of the package and to receive 3 MEGA COINS as an exclusive NEW-MEMBER PERK.</p>
<p>One use of the function costs the low, low price of 1 MEGA COIN.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>add_one(1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>📅 You have 30 days left of your FREE TRIAL!
🏅 Your MEMBER LEVEL is 1! Try watch_ad()!
💰 Your MEGA COIN balance is now 2! Try watch_ad()!
[1] 2</code></pre>
<p>Along with the result, the function helpfully prints the number of days left in your FREE TRIAL, your MEMBER LEVEL and the number of MEGA COINS you have left.</p>
<p>What’s a MEMBER LEVEL? Well, at MEMBER LEVEL 1, the function can’t guarantee a correct result. 20% of the time there’ll be an off-by-one error. But R users index from 1 anyway, so they’ll be used to that.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>add_one(1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>📅 You have 30 days left of your FREE TRIAL!
🏅 Your MEMBER LEVEL is 1! Try watch_ad()!
💰 Your MEGA COIN balance is now 1! Try watch_ad()!
[1] 3</code></pre>
<p>How can you get the correct result 100% of the time? That’s an exclusive for MEMBER LEVEL 2. How do you reach MEMBER LEVEL 2? What happens if you run out of MEGA COINS?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>add_one(1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>📅 You have 30 days left of your FREE TRIAL!
🏅 Your MEMBER LEVEL is 1! Try watch_ad()!
Error: 😭 You&#39;ll need more MEGA COINS to re-use this function! Try watch_ad()!</code></pre>
<p>Answer: simply watch some ads! I’ve managed to get an ad deal with the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_Corporation">Acme(TM) Corporation</a>. Maybe you could get a sponsorship deal from a third-party whose interests align with your users’ interests; maybe SAS, SPSS or Stata would be interested?</p>
<p>Anyway, the user can just <code>watch_ad()</code> in exchange for MEGA COINS: I’ve allowed the user to employ their FREE WILL to watch a <code>"short"</code> ad for 1 MEGA COIN or a <code>"long"</code> ad for 3 MEGA COINS.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>watch_ad(&quot;short&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>🌭 CONSUME ACME(TM)-BRAND RECONSTITUTED MEAT-LIKE CYLINDERS! 🐕
🌭 CONSUME ACME(TM)-BRAND RECONSTITUTED MEAT-LIKE CYLINDERS! 🐕
🌭 CONSUME ACME(TM)-BRAND RECONSTITUTED MEAT-LIKE CYLINDERS! 🐕
🌭 CONSUME ACME(TM)-BRAND RECONSTITUTED MEAT-LIKE CYLINDERS! 🐕
🌭 CONSUME ACME(TM)-BRAND RECONSTITUTED MEAT-LIKE CYLINDERS! 🐕
Congratulations! Your new MEGA COIN total is 1!</code></pre>
<p>Reach MEMBER LEVEL 2 after gaining 10 all-time MEGA COINS and MEMBER LEVEL 3 after 20 MEGA COINS.</p>
<p>What’s the exclusive MEMBER LEVEL 3? Of course, the answer will be correct… and comes with a randomised FREE HAT!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>add_one(1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>📅 You have 30 days left of your FREE TRIAL!
🏅 Your MEMBER LEVEL is 3! Try watch_ad()!
💰 Your MEGA COIN balance is now 19! Try watch_ad()!

<p>What a tease! Oh, and the stats are persistent, so your users can’t refresh their session and wipe the slate clean. Watch the cash roll in!</p>

<p>I hope this has been an inspirational eye-opener for you and that one day you can be as rich as me. Oh, you didn’t know I was rich? How else could I afford to keep this absolute juggernaut of a blog going?</p>
<p>To demonstrate how little I personally need them, here are some more ideas to maximise your financial rewards via R. You could try:</p>
<ul>
<li>releasing version updates as paid add-ons, like videogame DLC (you could also make them take several hours to download, like videogame DLC, which would definitely heighten the tension)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box#Criticism">loot boxes</a> to allow users to gamble—I mean, test their precognitive skills—for new functionality (<code>add_two()</code> could be a common drop, while <code>multiply_by_two()</code> is ultra rare)</li>
<li>using certified financial guru <a href="https://github.com/nacnudus/ggbillboard">Duncan Garmonsway’s {ggbillboard} package</a> (‘use vacant ggplot2 facets for advertising’)</li>
</ul>
<p>You are welcome. Don’t read the small print for nerds.</p>

Small print for nerds.

It’s a simple trick: up-to-date stats are stored on the user’s computer in the directory resolved by <code>tools::R_user_dir("monetize", "data")</code><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> and are updated each time you use the functions in the package. Easy to circumvent… if you know how.
