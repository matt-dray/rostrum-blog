# tl;dr

I wrote an R function to extract only the punctuation marks from a provided text. It prints prettily to the console, but you can also take a character vector away for further analysis.

# Punct rock

A few years ago [Adam J Calhoun did a small but really neat thing](https://medium.com/@neuroecology/punctuation-in-novels-8f316d542ec4): extracted and presented only the punctuation from some books. It appeared again recently in my Twitter timeline.

I love the aesthetic of the neatly printed characters, but it also tells us something (obvious?) about writing styles.

Long story short: old-timey folk often wrote convoluted sentences; literature and essays from a hundred or more years ago are especially rich with semi-colons, commas, more commas and of course, as the audience is well-aware, even more commas, which to modern eyes can be a little tiring; certainly it's a style that is out of fashion, but was pretty hip for, let's say, Herman Melville, when writing his behemoth of a novel,  _Moby Dick; Or, The Whale_.

Whereas Hemingway was terse.

# You've been punct

So I wrote a small, opinionated R function called `extract_punct()` that grabs the punctuation characters for a given text.

Someone has probably done this in R before. I saw that Julia Silge [wrote a post](https://juliasilge.com/blog/punctution-literature/) on quantifying punctuation like Calhoun's original, but it doesn't involve printing the characters.

The purpose of this post is just to show how to do the extraction and print it nicely to the console, though the function allows you to take away a character vector for further analysis.

## Functuation

Below is the definition for `extract_punct()`. You supply your content to `text`, and then you set the arguments:

* `sort = FALSE` to return the punctuation in the order it appears in the text, or `TRUE` to order it 'alphabetically'
* `vec_only = TRUE` to early-return the punctuation characters as a vector for you to do with as you please
* `vec_only = FALSE` to print the results to the console with `cat()`
* `width` to decide where the line breaks will go in the printed output (defaults to 80)
* `colour = TRUE` to have each punctuation character returned in colour thanks to [the {crayon} package by Gábor Csárdi](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon)[^crayon], or `FALSE` to return without colour

```{r fn}
extract_punct <- function(text,              # input text
                          sort = FALSE,      # order the characters?
                          vec_only = FALSE,  # return as char vector?
                          width = 80,        # width of output
                          colour = TRUE) {   # colour output?
  
  # Extract punctuation with regular expression
  punct_rx  <- "[\\.,:;!?\"\'\\()]"
  matches   <- regexpr(punct_rx, text)
  punct_vec <- regmatches(text, matches)
  
  # Sort alphabetically?
  if (sort) punct_vec <- punct_vec[order(punct_vec)]
  
  # Early return of character vector
  if (vec_only) return(punct_vec)
  
  # Colour the characters
  punct_vec <- sapply(
    punct_vec, switch,
    "."  = crayon::blue("."),
    "!"  = crayon::blue("!"),
    "?"  = crayon::blue("?"),
    ","  = crayon::yellow(","),
    ";"  = crayon::yellow(";"),
    ":"  = crayon::yellow(":"),
    "\"" = crayon::red("\""),
    "'"  = crayon::red("'"),
    "("  = crayon::silver("("),
    ")"  = crayon::silver(")")
  )
  
  # Print without colour
  if (!is.null(width) & !colour) {
    cat(names(punct_vec), sep = "", fill = width)
  }
  
  # Convoluted colour printing, requires flattening a matrix
  if (!is.null(width) & colour) {
    div_size <- length(punct_vec) %/% width * width
    mat_flat <- c(rbind("\n", matrix(punct_vec[1:div_size], nrow = width)))
    leftover <- c("\n", punct_vec[div_size:length(punct_vec)])
    cat(mat_flat[2:length(mat_flat)], leftover, sep = "")
  }
  
}
```

There's no defensive programming or testing here; this is just for fun for the purposes of this blog post. Maybe it'll work on your machine?

I decided to colour by 'type' of mark: terminal (period, exclamation and question), 'continuing' marks (comma, semi-colon and colon), parenthetical (open and close) and quote signifiers (quotation marks and apostrophes, recognising that apostrophes are more likely to be used for contractions).

There were a couple of technical annoyances to deal with in the function definition; let me know what you would improve.[^tech]

## {gutenbergr}, dead ahead!

Let's inspect the punctuation from some books on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), 'a volunteer effort to digitize, archive, and distribute literary works'.

Helpfully, we can interact with Project Gutenberg's library via the [{gutenbergr} package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gutenbergr) by [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/).[^dr]

```{r gb-works}
library(gutenbergr)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(stringr)

sample_n(gutenberg_metadata, 5) %>% select(1:3)
```

You could filter for a particular author or title, like Franz Kafka.

```{r gb-author}
gutenberg_metadata %>% 
  filter(str_detect(author, "Kafka")) %>%
  select(1:3) %>%
  slice(1:5)
```

I've chosen [Edwin A Abbott's _Flatland_ (1884)](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97) as our example text. It's relatively short, so we can get the gist of the output from `extract_punct()` without printing hundreds of lines. Also it's a really fun little book that blew my mind.[^sagan]

You can get a Gutenberg book by finding its 'Gutenberg ID' to input into `extract_punct()`? One way is to look at the URL for a given book on the Project Gutenberg website, another is to search the `gutenberg_metadata()`[^works] dataframe. I'll also load {dplyr} and {stringr} for wrangling.

```{r download}
id <- gutenberg_works() %>% 
  filter(str_detect(title, "^Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions$")) %>%
  pull(gutenberg_id)

book <- gutenberg_download(id, verbose = FALSE)

book %>% filter(!is.na(text)) %>% sample_n(5) %>% select(text)
```

Right so, we can pass the text to the `extract_punct()` function to return all the punctuation in the order it appears, with linebreak every 70 characters so the text fits the width of this blog.

```{r ex}
extract_punct(book$text, width = 70, colour = FALSE)
```

I passed `colour = FALSE` because the blog can't render the colours. Set `colour = TRUE` to have the characters returned in your console with a different colour for each type of mark. That looks like this:

<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2021-09-10-punct-lit_files/flatland.png" alt="A screenshot of the R console in RStudio showing a large number of printed punctuation characters with linebreaks every 70 characters and with each punctuation mark coloured differently." width="100%"/>
<p class="caption">All punctuation from 'Flatland' by Edward A Abbott</p>
</div>

For fun, we can also get the same output as before, but ordered by character.

```{r ex-sort}
extract_punct(book$text, sort = TRUE, width = 70, colour = FALSE)
```

## Full stop

So that's the general gist. 

Here's a few more books from Project Gutenberg. Expand to see the punctuation for each one:

<details><summary>_Pride and Prejudice_ by Jane Austen (1813)</summary>
```{r}
extract_punct(
  gutenberg_download(1342, verbose = FALSE)$text,
  width = 70
)
```
</details>

<details><summary>_The Metamorphosis_ by Franz Kafka (1915)</summary>
```{r}
extract_punct(
  gutenberg_download(5200, verbose = FALSE)$text,
  width = 70
)
```
</details>

<details><summary>_Moby Dick; Or, The Whale_ by Herman Melville (1851)</summary>
```{r}
extract_punct(
  gutenberg_download(2489, verbose = FALSE)$text,
  width = 70
)
```
</details>

Feel free to experiment with `extract_punct()` and let me know how it goes.

<details><summary>Session info</summary>
```{r sessioninfo, echo=FALSE}
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
</details>

You could expand this. Maybe include en and em dashes, or take a look at the use of 'curly' quotes, or something.

[^dr]: No, not the legendary San Antonio Spurs center from the 90s.
[^crayon]: Readers may remember {crayon} from my recent post about [the {dehex} package](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/08/10/dehex/).
[^tech]: In particular, it's easy to print the character vector of punctuation characters and linebreak it with the `fill` argument of `cat()`, but this behaviour is altered when you convert the characters to {crayon} strings. Instead, `extract_punct()` inserts newline characters at the desired print width using a crummy trick that flattens a matrix of the punctuation characters. Of course, matrices are 'square', so there are leftover punctuation characters that have to be dealt with separately and pasted on to the end, lol.
[^works]: Note that you can use `gutenberg_works()` for a pre-filtered dataset with English-only texts, are in text format and whose text is not under copyright.
[^sagan]: I think I first learnt about this from [Carl Sagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0WjV6MmCyM).
