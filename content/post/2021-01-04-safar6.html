<h1>tl;dr</h1>
<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/safar6">the R package {safar6}</a>, which contains an R6-class object to simulate a simplified, text-based version of <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kanto_Safari_Zone">the Safari Zone</a> sub-area from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"><em>Pokémon Blue</em></a>.</p>
<p>I also made <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/gamelad">the ‘gamelad’ RStudio theme</a> to mimic the screen of a pukey-green original Game Boy. Pair with a blocky monospace font like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323">VT323</a> for that 8-bit experience.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<div id="kangaskhan-you-believe-it" class="section level1">
<h1><em>Kangaskhan</em> you believe it?</h1>
<p>Did you know you can <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/data-science/games-in-r/">play games in R</a>?</p>
<p>I particularly like the text adventures <a href="https://lucidmanager.org/data-science/text-adventure/">The Secret of Landusia</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/lucidmanager">Peter Prevos</a> and <a href="http://giorasimchoni.com/2017/09/10/2017-09-10-you-re-in-a-room-the-castleofr-package/">Castle of R</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/GioraSimchoni">Giora Simchoni</a></p>
<p>The latter uses <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/">object-oriented programming</a> (OOP) for handling game elements, thanks to the <a href="https://r6.r-lib.org/">{R6}</a> package. So, a room in the castle is an R6-class object with specific fields (variables), like whether the door is <code>open</code>, and methods (functions) like <code>openDoor()</code> that can change the door state.</p>
<p>This is interesting because R is better known for being a function- rather than an object-oriented language. You can learn more about OOP in R from <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo.html">Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R book</a> and more about the R6-class from <a href="https://r6.r-lib.org/index.html">the {R6} website</a>.</p>

<h1>A <em>Chansey</em> to learn</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.rostrum.blog/2020/04/04/repaying-tom-nook-with-r6/">I wrote a post about using {R6} to simulate an Automatic Bell Dispenser</a> (an ATM, basically) from Nintendo’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Horizons"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a> (2020) game. Fields include <code>savings</code> and methods include <code>withdraw()</code>, for example.</p>
<p>Obviously my next step was to use {R6} for a game, but I wanted to start small. The original <em>Pokémon</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> games were effectively text adventures with some random-number generation and simple calculations going on in the background. Would it be possible to simulate some aspects of it?</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>Luckily, there’s an in-game sub-area that’s self-contained and much simpler than the mechanics in the rest of the world. In the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kanto_Safari_Zone">The Safari Zone</a> you’re only allowed to take 500 steps, you can only use a special type of ball to capture wild Pokémon (of which you only have 30) and you can’t reduce a wild Pokémon’s health (hit points, HP).</p>
<p>So I went ahead and wrote an R6-class object to mimic the Safari Zone and bundled it in <a href="https://www.github.com/matt-dray/safar6/">the {safar6} R package</a>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="a-quick-tauros-of-the-game" class="section level1">
<h1>A quick <em>Tauros</em> of the game</h1>
<p>You can install the package <a href="https://www.github.com/matt-dray/safar6/">from GitHub</a>. Loading the package provides a reminder of how to play.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Install first the the {remotes} package
remotes::install_github(&quot;matt-dray/safar6&quot;)

library(safar6)
# {safar6}
# Start game: x &lt;- safari_zone$new()
# Take a step: x$step()</code></pre>
<p>Basically, the package contains an R6-class object <code>SafariZone</code>, which you initialise like <code>safari_zone$new()</code>. Make sure to assign a name to it (<code>x</code> in these examples). This starts a routine with some text from the game and some interactive elements. Sometimes you’ll be prompted for a response; type a value and hit enter to make a choice.</p>
<p>Here’s the opening sequence, which asks for your name and invites you to play:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- safari_zone$new()
# First, what is your name?
# ------------------------
# NEW NAME (1)
# BLUE (2)
# GARY (3)
# JOHN (4)
# ------------------------
# Select 1, 2, 3 or 4:
1
# Your name: 
THEW
# Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!
# For just P500, you can catch all the
# Pokemon you want in the park!
# Would you like to join the hunt?
# ------------------------
# MONEY: P500
# YES (1) or NO (2)
# ------------------------
# Select 1 or 2: 
1
# That&#39;ll be P500 please!
# ------------------------
# MONEY: P0
# ------------------------
# We only use a special POKe BALL here.
# THEW received 30 SAFARI BALLs!
# We&#39;ll call you on the PA when you run out of time or SAFARI BALLs!</code></pre>
<p>You can then ‘move around’ by using the <code>step()</code> method on your <code>SafariZone</code> object. This method does most of the hard work in {safar6}, since it contains all the logic required for a wild Pokémon encounter.</p>
<p>The underlying values and calculations in <code>step()</code> are all true to the original game. That includes the encounter rate, which is less than 1, so you’ll likely have to <code>step()</code> a number of times before you find a Pokémon.</p>
<p>For convenience, the step method prints the number of steps remaining:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x$step()
# 499/500</code></pre>
<p>Each step is treated as though you’re walking through the tall grass, which is where you find wild Pokémon. There’s a weighted chance of encountering certain Pokémon at certain levels, but each wild Pokémon also has (hidden) randomised individual variation in its stats (HP, speed, etc) that impact your ability to catch it.</p>
<p>Here’s an encounter:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x$step()
# 497/500
# Wild VENONAT L22 appeared!
# ------------------------
# BALLx30 (1)     BAIT (2)
# THROW ROCK (3)  RUN (4)
# ------------------------
# Select 1, 2, 3 or 4: </code></pre>
<p>At the prompt, you can throw a Safari ball straight away to attempt a catch, or you can run away from the encounter. You can also influence the Pokémon’s state: throw a rock to raise the catch chance (but you’ll also increase the flee chance) or throw bait to reduce the chance of fleeing (but that’ll also decrease the catch chance).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Wild VENONAT L22 appeared!
# ------------------------
# BALLx30 (1)     BAIT (2)
# THROW ROCK (3)  RUN (4)
# ------------------------
# Select 1, 2, 3 or 4: 
3
# THEW threw a ROCK.
# Wild VENONAT is angry!</code></pre>
<p>The Pokémon will be angry or eating for one to five turns.</p>
<p>When you throw a ball, the success of a capture attempt is determined by several factors, like the Pokémon’s HP, its level and its catch rate (possibly modified by rocks and bait). It may also run away given factors like its speed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># THEW threw a ROCK.
# Wild VENONAT is angry!
# ------------------------
# BALLx30 (1)     BAIT (2)
# THROW ROCK (3)  RUN (4)
# ------------------------
# Select 1, 2, 3 or 4: 
1
# THEW used SAFARI BALL!
# Wobble...
# Darn! The POKeMON broke free!</code></pre>
<p>You may want to change your strategy. More rocks, or some bait? While it’s still angry, you could take advantage of its heightened catch rate by throwing another ball.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Wild VENONAT is angry!
# ------------------------
# BALLx29 (1)     BAIT (2)
# THROW ROCK (3)  RUN (4)
# ------------------------
# Select 1, 2, 3 or 4: 
1
# THEW used SAFARI BALL!
# Wobble... Wobble... Wobble...
# All right!
# VENONAT was caught!</code></pre>
<p>Success! You can choose to give your ‘captured friend’ a nickname.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># ------------------------
# Do you want to give a nickname to VENONAT?
# YES (1) or NO (2)
# ------------------------
# Select 1 or 2:
1
# Nickname: 
Tajiri
# Tajiri was transferred to BILL&#39;s PC!</code></pre>
<p>Try to catch as many as you can before you run out of steps or balls. You can <code>x$pause()</code> the game at any point to see your remaining stats and you can check out <code>x$bills_pc</code> to see what you’ve captured<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x$pause()
# 497/500
# BALLx28
# BILL&#39;s PC: 1
x$bills_pc
#   nickname species level
# 1   Tajiri VENONAT    22</code></pre>
<p>When the game is over, you’ll see an endscreen with your results.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># ------------------------
# PA: Ding-dong!
# Time&#39;s up!
# PA: Your SAFARI GAME is over!
# Did you get a good haul?
# Come again!
# ------------------------
# Result: 1 transferred to BILL&#39;s PC
#   nickname species level
# 1   Tajiri VENONAT    22</code></pre>
<p>The Safari Zone in the original game was pretty tricky. The Pokémon were flighty and it was especially hard to trap rare encounters like Chansey, Pinsir and Scyther.</p>
<p>The most captures I’ve made on a playthrough of {safar6} is three (!), so use that as a yardstick.</p>
</div>
<div id="exeggcute-ing-the-class" class="section level1">
<h1><em>Exeggcute</em>-ing the class</h1>
<p>I tried to keep things simple, so there’s a number of omissions compared to the original game. For example, there’s no visuals or sounds; I’ve simulated only the ‘Center’ hub area of the Safari Zone; you walk around as though you’re always in tall grass; you can’t fish or use different rod types; you’re restricted to the catch rates and Pokémon identities of the <em>Blue</em> game (not <em>Red</em> or <em>Yellow</em>, which are different).</p>
<p>On the flipside, I tried to maintain some subtle true-to-the-original elements. For example, you’ll be prompted to enter your name; you can nickname your Pokémon; there’s ‘wobble logic’ for deciding how many times the ball should shake before a capture; and the majority of the text is as it appears in the game. I’ve also made it so the text is progressively revealed, character by character.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">
Progressive text reveal. Takes longer to print but is more authentic.
</p>
</div>
<p>In particular, I’ve tried to keep the various hidden and non-hidden Pokémon stats and calculations true to <em>Pokémon Blue</em>. For example, I built in:</p>
<ul>
<li>original encounter rates, both for the Safari Zone and the wild Pokémon in it</li>
<li>wild Pokémon base statistics and calculation of randomised individual values</li>
<li>catch rates based on factors like ball type and HP, and any modifications during the encounter</li>
<li>tracking of ‘eating’ and ‘anger’ statuses and the effects on catch rates</li>
<li>the calculation for whether a wild Pokémon will flee</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no guarantee I’ve got these things completely right, but the gameplay appears similar to the original, so I think it’s close enough.</p>
</div>
<div id="disen-tangela-ing-game-mechanics" class="section level1">
<h1>Disen-<em>Tangela</em>-ing game mechanics</h1>
<p>Information about game mechanics and values were relatively tricky to come by. The following resources were really important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/">Bulbapedia</a> is the Bible of Pokémon and hosts various stats and formulae</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dragonflycave.com/">The Cave of Dragonflies</a> has some excellent breakdowns of game mechanics, particularly in capture and Safari Zone logic</li>
<li>the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pokemonslots">Pokémon Slots</a> website is a convenient lookup for base encounter rates for wild Pokémon by area</li>
<li>the <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokered">pret/pokered GitHub repo</a> contains a disassembly of the games, where you can see the raw game mechanics and stats<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I later saw on YouTube some interesting attempts at building small text-based Pokémon games like {safar6}. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbs6jQZrZA4">one in Python by Rylan Fowers</a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and one for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBMS8lsgzrU">TI-84 calculator (of course) by Aeri</a>.</p>

<div id="dont-marowak-living-creatures" class="section level1">
<h1>Don’t <em>Marowak</em> living creatures</h1>
<p>Obviously this is for fun and learning. Play at your own risk. Feel free to report any bugs (as in code problems, not bug-type Pokémon) as <a href="https://github.com/matt-dray/safar6/issues">GitHub issues</a>.</p>
<p>And do not, I repeat, <em>do not</em> throw rocks at animals IRL.</p>
