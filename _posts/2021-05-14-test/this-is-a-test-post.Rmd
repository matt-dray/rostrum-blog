Here's a demo of some R code written in an R Markdown chunk:

```{r}
library(dplyr)

table <- mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(
    across(
      disp:wt, 
      ~mean(., na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  )

knitr::kable(table)
```


```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r sessioninfo, echo=FALSE}
sessioninfo::session_info()
```
