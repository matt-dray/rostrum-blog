      <description>Prepare the workspace library(spotifyr) library(dplyr) library(purrr) library(tidyr) You need to sign up for a Spotify developer account and add your client ID and client secret to the environment. This is passed to each of the functions of {spotifyr} to let us access the Spotify API.
access_token &amp;lt;- get_spotify_access_token()  Get albums The get_artist_albums() function takes an artist ID and fetches the albums for that artist.
The Mountain Goats can be identified by the URI spotify:artist:3hyGGjxu73JuzBa757H6R5, where the 22-character value is the artist ID used by {spotifyr}.</description>

Classic Jazz: Stockton to Malone for the dunk (via Giphy)
 TL;DR The gmapsdistance R package lets you query the Google Maps API. I used it to look at travel distances between basketball teams. Surprise: they can be far apart even if they’re in the same division.
 The NBA The USA is pretty big.
So the National Basketball Association (NBA) is separated geographically into Eastern and Western conferences, each with three divisions of five teams.</description>

Doc rot I wrote a PhD thesis in 2014 called Effects of multiple environmental stressors on litter chemical composition and decomposition. See my viva presentation slides here if you don’t really like words.
On graduation day, a stranger came up to me and, to paraphrase, said ‘you doctors should be proud of what you’ve achieved, you’re doing a great service’. I didn’t have the heart to tell him that I wasn’t a medical doctor.</description>

Super cool 90s guy ready to surf the web (via Giphy)
 Two-thousand and late Clip art! Fax machines! CD-ROMs! Dial-up modems! The World Wide Web! Mail merge!
These exotic terms give me flashbacks to computer class at the turn of the millennium.
I have particularly fond memories of learning to mail merge, which was taught as a way to autocomplete template Word letters for made-up customers in some made-up Access database.</description>

⚠️ Warning: this post contains offensive words. ⚠️
Genius? Kanye West released his latest album – ye – last week1 after a(nother) pretty turbulent and controversial period of his life2. So what’s been on his mind?
I think the real question is why don’t we scrape Yeezus’s lyrics from the web and analyse them using R? Obviously.
 Genius Genius is a website where you can upload and comment on song lyrics.</description>

The pinnacle of visualisation Great news everyone: I’ve taken the best of two stellar data visualisations and smashed them together into something that can only be described as perfection.
Let me set the scene. There’s three things we can agree on:
Everyone loves pie charts, particularly when they’re in 3D, exploded and tilted. Word clouds aren’t at all overused. I have too much time on my hands.  With that in mind, I’ve artfully melded clouds and pies into the function cloud_pie, which I think sounds rather sweet.</description>

Call the fire brigade. Oh wait, we’re fine.
 TL;DR Animals get stuck in weird places, just ask the London Fire Brigade. I used the sf package for handling some animal rescue spatial data prior to interactive mapping with leaflet. Scroll to the bottom to see the map.
 The problem Sometimes I work with eastings and northings coordinate data.</description>

Captain’s log 📖  Star date 71750.51. Our mission is to use R statistical software to extract star dates mentioned in the captain’s log from the scripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation and observe their progression over the course of the show’s seven seasons. There appears to be some mismatch in the frequency of digits after the decimal point – could this indicate poor ability to choose random numbers?</description>
