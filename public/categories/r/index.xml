TL;DR I wrote an R Shiny app that tells you how many players at World Cup 2018 were younger than you.
It‚Äôs designed to make you feel old. You‚Äôre welcome.
Here‚Äôs some solid reviews I‚Äôve received so far:
 Very depressing
  I knew I was too old to become a great footballer
  Just what I needed to see
 Thanks folks!
 I was at the World Cup Final So the World Cup is over for another year.</description>

Doc rot I wrote a PhD thesis in 2014 called Effects of multiple environmental stressors on litter chemical composition and decomposition. See my viva presentation slides here if you don‚Äôt really like words.
On graduation day, a stranger came up to me and, to paraphrase, said ‚Äòyou doctors should be proud of what you‚Äôve achieved, you‚Äôre doing a great service‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell him that I wasn‚Äôt a medical doctor.</description>

Two-thousand and late Clip art! Fax machines! CD-ROMs! Dial-up modems! The World Wide Web! Mail merge!
These exotic terms give me flashbacks to computer class at the turn of the millennium.
The last one‚Äìmail merge‚Äìwas taught as a way to autocomplete template Word letters for made-up customers in an Access database. I no longer need to invoice ‚ÄòMr Sonic The-Hedgehog‚Äô for ordering ‚Äò25 chili dogs‚Äô, but the general approach of generating the same template multiple times with different information is still pertinent.</description>

Genius? Kanye West released his latest album ‚Äì ye ‚Äì last week1 after a(nother) pretty turbulent and controversial period of his life2. So what‚Äôs been on his mind?
I think the real question is why don‚Äôt we scrape Yeezus‚Äôs lyrics from the web and analyse them using R? Obviously.
 Genius Genius is a website where you can upload and comment on song lyrics.</description>

The pinnacle of visualisation Great news everyone: I‚Äôve taken the best of two stellar data visualisations and smashed them together into something that can only be described as perfection.
Let me set the scene. There‚Äôs three things we can agree on:
Everyone loves pie charts, particularly when they‚Äôre in 3D, exploded and tilted. Word clouds aren‚Äôt at all overused. I have too much time on my hands.  With that in mind, I‚Äôve artfully melded clouds and pies into the function cloud_pie, which I think sounds rather sweet.</description>

TL;DR Animals get stuck in weird places. Oh, and the sf package in R can be used for coordinate reprojection prior to interactive mapping with leaflet.
 The problem I often work with data that has coordinates; usually a eastings and northings. I need to convert these to latitude and longitude for interactive mapping using the leaflet package in R.</description>

Captain‚Äôs log üìñ  Star date 71750.51. Our mission is to use R statistical software to extract star dates mentioned in the captain‚Äôs log from the scripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation and observe their progression over the course of the show‚Äôs seven seasons. There appears to be some mismatch in the frequency of digits after the decimal point ‚Äì could this indicate poor abillity to choose random numbers?</description>
