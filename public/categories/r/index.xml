      <description>Prepare the workspace library(spotifyr) library(dplyr) library(purrr) library(tidyr) You need to sign up for a Spotify developer account and add your client ID and client secret to the environment. This is passed to each of the functions of {spotifyr} to let us access the Spotify API.
access_token &amp;lt;- get_spotify_access_token()  Get albums The get_artist_albums() function takes an artist ID and fetches the albums for that artist.
The Mountain Goats can be identified by the URI spotify:artist:3hyGGjxu73JuzBa757H6R5, where the 22-character value is the artist ID used by {spotifyr}.</description>

Classic Jazz: Stockton to Malone for the dunk (via Giphy)
 TL;DR The gmapsdistance R package lets you query the Google Maps API. I used it to look at travel distances between basketball teams. Surprise: they can be far apart even if they‚Äôre in the same division.
 The NBA The USA is pretty big.
So the National Basketball Association (NBA) is separated geographically into Eastern and Western conferences, each with three divisions of five teams.</description>

 RAP and the rise of reproducibility The UK government has got better at producing statistical reports in a reproducible way. A turning point was the creation of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) ‚Äì a method for making releases easier to recreate, test and audit. Matthews Upson and Gregory of Government Digital Service (GDS) have described and enshrined this process and enabled others to continue its spread.</description>

EARL 2018 I gave a talk called ‚ÄòCrosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny‚Äô1 at the 2018 EARL conference in London.
The crosstalk package by Joe Cheng allows htmlwidgets‚ÄîJavaScript visualisations wrapped in R code‚Äîto interact with each other. Filtering the data in widget causes all widgets to be filtered. This can be done inside an R Markdown document (including Flexdashboard) for easy server-less sharing in HTML format.</description>

 gifski::gifski() You and I both know that the world needs more intergalatic-sloth-pizza gifs.
Great news: ‚Äòthe fastest gif encoder in the universe‚Äô has been created. The gifski package for R is now in CRAN. It‚Äôs a simple yet fast and powerful way to create gifs from within R, built by Jeroen Oom (@opencpu) for ROpenSci.</description>

TL;DR I wrote an R Shiny app that tells you how many players at World Cup 2018 were younger than you. It‚Äôs designed to make you feel old. You‚Äôre welcome.
Here‚Äôs some solid reviews I‚Äôve received so far:
 Very depressing
  I knew I was too old to become a great footballer
  Just what I needed to see
 Thanks folks!

Doc rot I wrote a PhD thesis in 2014 called Effects of multiple environmental stressors on litter chemical composition and decomposition. See my viva presentation slides here if you don‚Äôt really like words.
On graduation day, a stranger came up to me and, to paraphrase, said ‚Äòyou doctors should be proud of what you‚Äôve achieved, you‚Äôre doing a great service‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell him that I wasn‚Äôt a medical doctor.</description>

Super cool 90s guy ready to surf the web (via Giphy)
 Two-thousand and late Clip art! Fax machines! CD-ROMs! Dial-up modems! The World Wide Web! Mail merge!
These exotic terms give me flashbacks to computer class at the turn of the millennium.
I have particularly fond memories of learning to mail merge, which was taught as a way to autocomplete template Word letters for made-up customers in some made-up Access database.</description>

Genius? Kanye West released his latest album ‚Äì ye ‚Äì last week1 after a(nother) pretty turbulent and controversial period of his life2. So what‚Äôs been on his mind?
I think the real question is why don‚Äôt we scrape Yeezus‚Äôs lyrics from the web and analyse them using R? Obviously.
 Genius Genius is a website where you can upload and comment on song lyrics.</description>

The pinnacle of visualisation Great news everyone: I‚Äôve taken the best of two stellar data visualisations and smashed them together into something that can only be described as perfection.
Let me set the scene. There‚Äôs three things we can agree on:
Everyone loves pie charts, particularly when they‚Äôre in 3D, exploded and tilted. Word clouds aren‚Äôt at all overused. I have too much time on my hands.  With that in mind, I‚Äôve artfully melded clouds and pies into the function cloud_pie, which I think sounds rather sweet.</description>

Call the fire brigade. Oh wait, we‚Äôre fine.
 TL;DR Animals get stuck in weird places, just ask the London Fire Brigade. I used the sf package for handling some animal rescue spatial data prior to interactive mapping with leaflet. Scroll to the bottom to see the map.
 The problem Sometimes I work with eastings and northings coordinate data.</description>

Captain‚Äôs log üìñ  Star date 71750.51. Our mission is to use R statistical software to extract star dates mentioned in the captain‚Äôs log from the scripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation and observe their progression over the course of the show‚Äôs seven seasons. There appears to be some mismatch in the frequency of digits after the decimal point ‚Äì could this indicate poor ability to choose random numbers?</description>
