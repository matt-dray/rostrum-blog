Clip art! Fax machines! CD-ROMs! Dial-up modems! The World Wide Web! Mail merge!
These exotic terms give me flashbacks to computer class at the turn of the millennium.
The last one – mail merge – is a technique you might still need to use. It involves filling a template document, typically a template letter, with information from unique cases in a database.
I’ve helped out some colleagues with report autogeneration a few times recently (mostly so no-one has to waste hours copy-pasting values into a template by hand).</description>

⚠️ Warning: this post contains offensive words. ⚠️
Genius?Kanye West released his latest album – ye – last week1 after a(nother) pretty turbulent and controversial period of his life2. So what’s been on his mind?
I think the real question is why don’t we scrape Yeezus’s lyrics from the web and analyse them using R? Obviously.
GeniusGenius is a website where you can upload and comment on song lyrics.</description>

The pinnacle of visualisationGreat news everyone: I’ve taken the best of two stellar data visualisations and smashed them together into something that can only be described as perfection.
Let me set the scene. There’s three things we can agree on:
🥧 Everyone loves pie charts, particularly when they’re in 3D, exploded and tilted.☁️ Word clouds aren’t at all overused.🤷🏿 I have too much time on my hands.</description>

TL;DRAnimals get stuck in weird places. Oh, and the sf package in R can be used for coordinate reprojection prior to interactive mapping with leaflet.
The problemI often work with data that has coordinates; usually a eastings and northings. I need to convert these to latitude and longitude for interactive mapping using the leaflet package in R.</description>

Captain’s log 📖Star date 71750.51. Our mission is to use R statistical software to extract star dates mentioned in the captain’s log from the scripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation and observe their progression over the course of the show’s seven seasons. There appears to be some mismatch in the frequency of digits after the decimal point – could this indicate poor abillity to choose random numbers?</description>
