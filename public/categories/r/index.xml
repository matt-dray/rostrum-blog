I posted about using a Markov chain to generate sentences using my PhD thesis as input. I also posted about [the {markovifyR} package}(https://github.com/abresler/markovifyR) for generating lyrics by The Mountain Goats.
So now I’m revisting the PhD post using {markovifyR} for my own amusement.
The PhD text is available from my {dray} package. I’ll remove the blank lines and ignore the preamble and references section.
library(dray) # remotes::install_github(&amp;quot;matt-dray/dray&amp;quot;) phd_text &amp;lt;- dray::phd # get data phd_text &amp;lt;- phd[nchar(phd) &amp;gt; 0] # remove blank lines phd_text &amp;lt;- phd[27:376] # ignore preamble and references Now to prepare the workspace, build the model and generate some sentences.</description>

John Darnielle with the green-scaled slipcase for In League with Dragons
 The Mountain Goats released In League with Dragons today, their seventeenth studio album.
John Darnielle has written a lot of words across the Mountain Goat’s back catalogue. His lyrics are poetic and descriptive, covering fictional and autobiographical themes that include susbtance abuse, professional wrestling and cadaver-sniffing dogs.
Can we generate new Mountain Goats lyrics given this rich text dataset?</description>

Data leaking from a pipe (via Giphy)
 TL;DR You can chain function calls in R with %&amp;gt;%. There’s a few ways to catch errors in these pipelines.
 C’est un pipe You know R’s %&amp;gt;% (pipe) operator by now. It lets you chain function calls. It was created for Stefan Milton Bache and Hadley Wickham’s {magrittr} package and popularised by the tidyverse. Par exemple:
# {dplyr} for data manipulation # it also re-exports the pipe from {magrittr} library(dplyr) # Get mean sepal width for two iris species iris_pipe &amp;lt;- iris %&amp;gt;% filter(Species %in% c(&amp;quot;setosa&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;versicolor&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% group_by(Species) %&amp;gt;% summarise(`Mean width` = mean(Sepal.</description>

Hang in there, buddy (via Giphy)
 What’s an R profile? It’s a file that contains R code that runs when you start or restart R. You can use it to customise your environment. For example, you could set options, create functions or load packages.
There’s lots of information in the R startup chapter of Colin Gillespie’s’s Efficient R Programming book.
But beware: use of an R profile may not be particularly reproducible if the .</description>

Classic Jazz: Stockton to Malone for the dunk (via Giphy)
 TL;DR The gmapsdistance R package lets you query the Google Maps API. I used it to look at travel distances between basketball teams. Surprise: they can be far apart even if they’re in the same division.
 The NBA The USA is pretty big.
So the National Basketball Association (NBA) is separated geographically into Eastern and Western conferences, each with three divisions of five teams.</description>

Walrus with rainbow vomit, of course (via Giphy)
 Colour search Lots of online services let you sort images by colour. Some examples:
 Google Arts &amp;amp; Culture Designspiration TinEye Multicolr  These services must have extracted and quantified each image’s colours. There’s probably a simple way of doing this in R, so let’s give it a go.
By ‘simple’ I mean we’re not going to do any hard work or consider any colour theory.</description>

 How to plot grouped continuous data? A boxplot lets you show continuous data split by categories, but it hides the data points and doesn’t tell you much about distribution. A violin chart will show the distribution but you still don’t know about the density of data.
Stripcharts show the data for each category as individual points.</description>

It gives a snapshot to help people reproduce what you’ve done or spot any anomalies. You might get asked for this if someone is diagnosing your R problem. You may also see it at the end of blog posts or reports.</description>

Everyone loves pie charts, particularly when they’re in 3D, exploded and tilted. Word clouds aren’t at all overused. I have too much time on my hands.  With that in mind, I’ve artfully melded clouds and pies into the function cloud_pie, which I think sounds rather sweet.</description>

Our mission is to use R statistical software to extract star dates mentioned in the captain’s log from the scripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation and observe their progression over the course of the show’s seven seasons. There appears to be some mismatch in the frequency of digits after the decimal point – could this indicate poor ability to choose random numbers?</description>
