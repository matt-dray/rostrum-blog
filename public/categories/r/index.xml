You teach me and I’ll teach you I recently shared some materials that I made to help some colleagues understand and start to use R Markdown as part of a reproducible workflow.
Well, now I’m sharing another thing I made. It’s called Beginner R and RStudio Training (featuring Pokemon!). It’s an introduction to R, RStudio, R Projects, directory structure and the Tidyverse for beginners… and uses Pokemon Go data that I collected myself.</description>

      <description>Matt Dray
What’s session info? Session info is just some details about your working environment like your version of R, the locale it’s running from and any loaded packages.
It gives a snapshot to help people reproduce what you’ve done or spot any anomalies. You might get asked for this if someone is diagnosing your R problem. You may also see it at the end of blog posts or reports.</description>

 RAP and the rise of reproducibility The UK government has got better at producing statistical reports in a reproducible way. A turning point was the creation of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) – a method for making releases easier to recreate, test and audit. Matthews Upson and Gregory of Government Digital Service (GDS) have described and enshrined this process and enabled others to continue its spread.
One useful and accessible tool for reproducibility is R Markdown, which allows you to execute R code inside your document and ‘knit’ it into a readable report.</description>

EARL 2018 I gave a talk called Crosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny1 at the EARL 2018 conference in London.
The crosstalk package by Joe Cheng allows HTML widgets – JavaScript visualisations wrapped in R code – to interact with each other. This can be done inside an R Markdown document (including Flexdashboard) for easy server-less sharing in HTML format.</description>

gifski::gifski() You and I both know that the world needs more intergalatic-sloth-pizza gifs.
Great news: ‘the fastest gif encoder in the universe’ has been created. The gifski package for R is now in CRAN. It’s a simple yet fast and powerful way to create gifs from within R, built by Jeroen Oom (@opencpu) for ROpenSci.
The obvious application is for creating gifs from plots, as in the following example from the ROpenSci announcement.</description>

TL;DR I wrote an R Shiny app that tells you how many players at World Cup 2018 were younger than you. It’s designed to make you feel old. You’re welcome.
Here’s some solid reviews I’ve received so far:
 Very depressing
  I knew I was too old to become a great footballer
  Just what I needed to see
 Thanks folks!
 I was at the World Cup Final So the World Cup is over for another year.</description>

Doc rot I wrote a PhD thesis in 2014 called Effects of multiple environmental stressors on litter chemical composition and decomposition. See my viva presentation slides here if you don’t really like words.
On graduation day, a stranger came up to me and, to paraphrase, said ‘you doctors should be proud of what you’ve achieved, you’re doing a great service’. I didn’t have the heart to tell him that I wasn’t a medical doctor.</description>

Two-thousand and late Clip art! Fax machines! CD-ROMs! Dial-up modems! The World Wide Web! Mail merge!
These exotic terms give me flashbacks to computer class at the turn of the millennium.
The last one–mail merge–was taught as a way to autocomplete template Word letters for made-up customers in an Access database. I no longer need to invoice ‘Mr Sonic The-Hedgehog’ for ordering ‘25 chili dogs’, but the general approach of generating the same template multiple times with different information is still pertinent.</description>

⚠️ Warning: this post contains offensive words. ⚠️
Genius? Kanye West released his latest album – ye – last week1 after a(nother) pretty turbulent and controversial period of his life2. So what’s been on his mind?
I think the real question is why don’t we scrape Yeezus’s lyrics from the web and analyse them using R? Obviously.
 Genius Genius is a website where you can upload and comment on song lyrics.</description>

The pinnacle of visualisation Great news everyone: I’ve taken the best of two stellar data visualisations and smashed them together into something that can only be described as perfection.
Let me set the scene. There’s three things we can agree on:
Everyone loves pie charts, particularly when they’re in 3D, exploded and tilted. Word clouds aren’t at all overused. I have too much time on my hands.  With that in mind, I’ve artfully melded clouds and pies into the function cloud_pie, which I think sounds rather sweet.</description>

Smash! Super Smash Bros (SSB) is a beat ’em up videogame series featuring characters from various Nintendo franchises and beyond.
The series has featured on Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Bros, 1998), Gamecube (SSB Melee, 2001), Wii (SSB Brawl, 2008), Wii U and 3DS (SSB ‘4’, 2014) and an upcoming title for the Switch console.
The game is popular enough to have resulted in a series of organised tournaments1.</description>

TL;DR Animals get stuck in weird places. Oh, and the sf package in R can be used for coordinate reprojection prior to interactive mapping with leaflet.
 The problem I often work with data that has coordinates; usually a eastings and northings. I need to convert these to latitude and longitude for interactive mapping using the leaflet package in R.</description>

Captain’s log 📖  Star date 71750.51. Our mission is to use R statistical software to extract star dates mentioned in the captain’s log from the scripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation and observe their progression over the course of the show’s seven seasons. There appears to be some mismatch in the frequency of digits after the decimal point – could this indicate poor abillity to choose random numbers?</description>
