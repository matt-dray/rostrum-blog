Sprinting Sprint events are a chance for the government digital, data, design and technology community to:
 look back on the work weâ€™ve been doing to transform government and to look forward at what we need to do
 Kevin Cunnington (@kevincunnington), Director General of the Government Digital Service (GDS), outlined this in a recent blog post.
This yearâ€™s major themes were transformation, innovation and collaboration. The event was held at the Southbank Centre and Royal Festival Hall in London, with 40 speakers, 19 workshops and over 700 delegates representing 40 departments and agencies.</description>

TL;DR Animals get stuck in weird places. Oh, and the sf package in R can be used for coordinate reprojection prior to interactive mapping with leaflet.
 The problem I often work with data that has coordinates; usually a eastings and northings. I need to convert these to latitude and longitude for interactive mapping using the leaflet package in R.</description>

Captainâ€™s log ðŸ“–  Star date 71750.51. Our mission is to use R statistical software to extract star dates mentioned in the captainâ€™s log from the scripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation and observe their progression over the course of the showâ€™s seven seasons. There appears to be some mismatch in the frequency of digits after the decimal point â€“ could this indicate poor abillity to choose random numbers?</description>
