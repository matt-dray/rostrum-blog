Genius? Kanye West released his latest album ‚Äì ye ‚Äì last week1 after a(nother) pretty turbulent and controversial period of his life2. So what‚Äôs been on his mind?
I think the real question is why don‚Äôt we scrape Yeezus‚Äôs lyrics from the web and analyse them using R? Obviously.
 Genius Genius is a website where you can upload and comment on song lyrics.</description>

The pinnacle of visualisation Great news everyone: I‚Äôve taken the best of two stellar data visualisations and smashed them together into something that can only be described as perfection.
Let me set the scene. There‚Äôs three things we can agree on:
ü•ß Everyone loves pie charts, particularly when they‚Äôre in 3D, exploded and tilted. ‚òÅÔ∏è Word clouds aren‚Äôt at all overused. ü§∑üèø I have too much time on my hands.</description>

Sprinting Sprint events are a chance for the government digital, data, design and technology community to:
 look back on the work we‚Äôve been doing to transform government and to look forward at what we need to do
 Kevin Cunnington (@kevincunnington), Director General of the Government Digital Service (GDS), outlined this in a recent blog post.
This year‚Äôs major themes were transformation, innovation and collaboration. The event was held at the Southbank Centre and Royal Festival Hall in London, with 40 speakers, 19 workshops and over 700 delegates representing 40 departments and agencies.</description>

TL;DR Animals get stuck in weird places. Oh, and the sf package in R can be used for coordinate reprojection prior to interactive mapping with leaflet.
 The problem I often work with data that has coordinates; usually a eastings and northings. I need to convert these to latitude and longitude for interactive mapping using the leaflet package in R.</description>

Captain‚Äôs log üìñ  Star date 71750.51. Our mission is to use R statistical software to extract star dates mentioned in the captain‚Äôs log from the scripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation and observe their progression over the course of the show‚Äôs seven seasons. There appears to be some mismatch in the frequency of digits after the decimal point ‚Äì could this indicate poor abillity to choose random numbers?</description>
