      <description>Modifying lithium metal with heat (via Giphy)
 tl;dr Add author name, categories and tags to the posts of your Lithium-themed {blogdown} site. Might work for other themes.
 Lithium This blog is generated using Yihui Xie’s {blogdown}, which is built on the Hugo framework.
A number of site-wide themes have been ported for use with {blogdown}. This site uses the clean and simple Lithium theme by Jonathan Rutheiser, modified for {blogdown} by Yihui.</description>

      <description>tl;dr Binder lets people explore your GitHub-based R code in a live, browser-based instance of RStudio – for free. Set-up for R projects is quick with {holepunch}.
I’ve used {holepunch} on my {drake} demo repo. Click the ‘launch binder’ badge in the repo’s README.
 Icing on the {drake} I wrote about how Will Landau’s excellent {drake} package could be used to minimise errors and speed up the production of statistical reports by the UK government.</description>

      <description>tl;dr The {drake} package records file interdependecies in your analysis. When files are changed, {drake} only re-runs the parts that need to be re-run. This saves time and reduces error.
This could be useful for Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP), an automated approach to producing UK government statistics that minimises error and speeds production.
 Make it to make it Analysis projects can become complicated as multiple inputs, script files and outputs build up.</description>

      <description>Sharing is caring GitHub has introduced repository templates to make it easier to share frequently-used repo structures and boilerplate code. You can copy a whole repo as many times as you like, unlike forks.
Following a template can help keep your work organised and encourage consistency within and between projects. I can see this being useful for sharing optimal workflows across boundaries like government departments.
 Tada I’ve made a lightweight repo template to make it easier for me to start very simple analysis projects with R.</description>

      <description>Data leaking from a pipe (via Giphy)  tl;dr You can chain function calls in R with %&amp;gt;%. There’s a few ways to catch errors in these pipelines.
 C’est un pipe You know R’s %&amp;gt;% (pipe) operator by now. It lets you chain function calls. It was created for Stefan Milton Bache and Hadley Wickham’s {magrittr} package and popularised by the tidyverse. Par exemple:
# {dplyr} for data manipulation # it also re-exports the pipe from {magrittr} library(dplyr) # Get mean sepal width for two iris species iris_pipe &amp;lt;- iris %&amp;gt;% filter(Species %in% c(&amp;quot;setosa&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;versicolor&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% group_by(Species) %&amp;gt;% summarise(`Mean width` = mean(Sepal.</description>

The National Deer-Vehicle Collisions Project, administered by The Deer Initiative, has been monitoring data on deer-vehicle collisions in the UK.
The data are open. I found the dataset when skimming through data.gov.uk (a classic weekend activity for all the family). It links to the SNH Natural Spaces site where you can download the data as shapefile, GML or KML under the Open Government Licence.</description>

Hang in there, buddy (via Giphy)
 What’s an R profile? It’s a file that contains R code that runs when you start or restart R. You can use it to customise your environment. For example, you could set options, create functions or load packages.
There’s lots of information in the R startup chapter of Colin Gillespie’s’s Efficient R Programming book.
But beware: use of an R profile may not be particularly reproducible if the .</description>

 TL;DR The gmapsdistance R package lets you query the Google Maps API. I used it to look at travel distances between basketball teams. Surprise: they can be far apart even if they’re in the same division.
 The NBA The USA is pretty big.
So the National Basketball Association (NBA) is separated geographically into Eastern and Western conferences, each with three divisions of five teams.</description>

 Colour search Lots of online services let you sort images by colour. Some examples:
 Google Arts &amp;amp; Culture Designspiration TinEye Multicolr  These services must have extracted and quantified each image’s colours. There’s probably a simple way of doing this in R, so let’s give it a go.
By ‘simple’ I mean we’re not going to do any hard work or consider any colour theory.</description>

 How to plot grouped continuous data? A boxplot lets you show continuous data split by categories, but it hides the data points and doesn’t tell you much about distribution. A violin chart will show the distribution but you still don’t know about the density of data.
Stripcharts show the data for each category as individual points.</description>

 RAP and the rise of reproducibility The UK government has got better at producing statistical reports in a reproducible way. A turning point was the creation of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) – a method for making releases easier to recreate, test and audit. Matthews Upson and Gregory of Government Digital Service (GDS) have described and enshrined this process and enabled others to continue its spread.</description>

EARL 2018 I gave a talk called ‘Crosstalk: Shiny-like without Shiny’1 at the 2018 EARL conference in London.
The crosstalk package by Joe Cheng allows htmlwidgets—JavaScript visualisations wrapped in R code—to interact with each other. Filtering the data in widget causes all widgets to be filtered. This can be done inside an R Markdown document (including Flexdashboard) for easy server-less sharing in HTML format.</description>

A sloth. On a pizza slice. In space. (via Giphy)
 gifski::gifski() You and I both know that the world needs more intergalatic-sloth-pizza gifs.
Great news: ‘the fastest gif encoder in the universe’ has been created. The gifski package for R is now in CRAN. It’s a simple yet fast and powerful way to create gifs from within R, built by Jeroen Oom (@opencpu) for ROpenSci.
The obvious application is for creating gifs from plots, as in the following example from the ROpenSci announcement.</description>

TL;DR I wrote an R Shiny app that tells you how many players at World Cup 2018 were younger than you. It’s designed to make you feel old. You’re welcome.
Here’s some solid reviews I’ve received so far:
 Very depressing
  I knew I was too old to become a great footballer
  Just what I needed to see
 Thanks folks!

The accessibility empathy lab at the Government Digital Services building
 Digital accessibility I wrote about an accessibility workshop at the recent Sprint 18 conference.
I’ve since been to a more in-depth workshop with Government Digital Service (GDS), who have just launched the latest version of their ‘testing for accessibility’ guidance in the Service Manual and also the GOV.UK Design System, which contains reusable GOV.UK styles, patterns and components with accessibility in mind.</description>

Doc rot I wrote a PhD thesis in 2014 called Effects of multiple environmental stressors on litter chemical composition and decomposition. See my viva presentation slides here if you don’t really like words.
On graduation day, a stranger came up to me and, to paraphrase, said ‘you doctors should be proud of what you’ve achieved, you’re doing a great service’. I didn’t have the heart to tell him that I wasn’t a medical doctor.</description>

Super cool 90s guy ready to surf the web (via Giphy)
 Two-thousand and late Clip art! Fax machines! CD-ROMs! Dial-up modems! The World Wide Web! Mail merge!
These exotic terms give me flashbacks to computer class at the turn of the millennium.
I have particularly fond memories of learning to mail merge, which was taught as a way to autocomplete template Word letters for made-up customers in some made-up Access database.</description>

Genius? Kanye West released his latest album – ye – last week1 after a(nother) pretty turbulent and controversial period of his life2. So what’s been on his mind?
I think the real question is why don’t we scrape Yeezus’s lyrics from the web and analyse them using R? Obviously.

The pinnacle of visualisation Great news everyone: I’ve taken the best of two stellar data visualisations and smashed them together into something that can only be described as perfection.
Let me set the scene. There’s three things we can agree on:
Everyone loves pie charts, particularly when they’re in 3D, exploded and tilted. Word clouds aren’t at all overused. I have too much time on my hands.  With that in mind, I’ve artfully melded clouds and pies into the function cloud_pie, which I think sounds rather sweet.</description>

Sprinting Sprint events are a chance for the government digital, data, design and technology community to:
 look back on the work we’ve been doing to transform government and to look forward at what we need to do
 Kevin Cunnington (@kevincunnington), Director General of the Government Digital Service (GDS), outlined this in a recent blog post.
This year’s major themes were transformation, innovation and collaboration. The event was held at the Southbank Centre and Royal Festival Hall in London, with 40 speakers, 19 workshops and over 700 delegates representing 40 departments and agencies.</description>

Call the fire brigade. Oh wait, we’re fine.
 TL;DR Animals get stuck in weird places, just ask the London Fire Brigade. I used the sf package for handling some animal rescue spatial data prior to interactive mapping with leaflet. Scroll to the bottom to see the map.
 The problem Sometimes I work with eastings and northings coordinate data.</description>

Captain’s log 📖  Star date 71750.51. Our mission is to use R statistical software to extract star dates mentioned in the captain’s log from the scripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation and observe their progression over the course of the show’s seven seasons. There appears to be some mismatch in the frequency of digits after the decimal point – could this indicate poor ability to choose random numbers?</description>
