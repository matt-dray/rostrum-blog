TL;DR Animals get stuck in weird places. Oh, and the sf package in R can be used for coordinate reprojection prior to interactive mapping with leaflet.
 The problem I often work with data that has coordinates; usually a eastings and northings. I need to convert these to latitude and longitude for interactive mapping using the leaflet package in R.</description>

 Captainâ€™s log ðŸ“–  Star date 71750.51. Our mission is to use R statistical software to extract star dates mentioned in the captainâ€™s log from the scripts of Star Trek: The Next Generation and observe their progression over the course of the showâ€™s seven seasons. There appears to be some mismatch in the frequency of digits after the decimal point â€“ could this indicate poor abillity to choose random numbers?</description>

Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Natural History Museum, London. I have a PhD in Ecology and an MRes in Entomology from Imperial College London, and a BSc in Biology from the University of Sussex.
In terms of my research, I am particularly interested in using large scale ecological datasets to answer policy relevant questions. I work on the PREDICTS project with Andy Purvis, looking at how biodiversity responds over time to land-use change and related pressures.</description>
